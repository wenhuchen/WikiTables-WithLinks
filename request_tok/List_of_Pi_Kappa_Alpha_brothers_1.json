Lampson was a Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Texas 's 9th congressional district from 1997 to 2005 . After an extremely controversial mid-decade redistricting , he lost his congressional seat in 2004 . In 2006 , he was elected to Congress to represent the Republican leaning 22nd district , represented by Tom DeLay , the former Republican Majority Leader and architect of the redistricting plan targeting Lampson . He lost his re-election bid in 2008 to Republican Pete Olson . In 2012 , Lampson was defeated by the Republican Randy Weber in his attempt to return to Congress in Ron Paul 's old congressional district . The gerrymandered districts in which he ran succeeded in preventing a member of the Democratic Party from being elected . He served a total of five terms in the U.S. House of Representatives . Prior to his time in Congress , Lampson served nearly twenty years as the Jefferson County tax assessor-collector . He is currently the Vice President of Operations at a regional healthcare company in Southeast Texas .",
