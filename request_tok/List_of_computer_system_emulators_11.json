  "/wiki/Acorn_Archimedes": "The Acorn Archimedes is a family of personal computers designed by Acorn Computers Ltd in Cambridge ( England ) and sold in the late-1980s to mid-1990s , Acorn 's first general-purpose home computer based on its own ARM architecture . The first Archimedes was launched in 1987 . ARM 's RISC design , a 32-bit CPU ( using 26-bit addressing ) , running at 8 MHz , was stated as achieving 4.5+ MIPS , which provided a significant upgrade from 8-bit home computers , such as Acorn 's previous machines . Claims of being the fastest micro in the world and running at 18 MIPS were also made during tests . The models in the family omitted either the Acorn or Archimedes part of the name ; the first models were named BBC Archimedes , yet the name Acorn Archimedes is commonly used to describe any of Acorn 's contemporary designs based on the same architecture . Archimedes machines are no longer sold , but computers such as the Raspberry Pi can still run its operating system , RISC OS ( at least later versions ) , as they use ARM chips that are ( mostly ) compatible .",
  "/wiki/RISC_OS": "RISC OS /r\u026asko\u028a\u02c8\u025bs/ is a computer operating system originally designed by Acorn Computers Ltd in Cambridge , England . First released in 1987 , it was designed to run on the ARM chipset , which Acorn had designed concurrently for use in its new line of Archimedes personal computers . RISC OS takes its name from the reduced instruction set computer ( RISC ) architecture it supports . Between 1987 and 1998 , RISC OS was included in every ARM-based Acorn computer model , including the Acorn Archimedes line , Acorn 's R line ( with RISC iX as a dual boot option ) , RiscPC , A7000 , and prototype models such as the Acorn NewsPad and Phoebe computer . A version of the OS , named NCOS , was used in Oracle Corporation 's Network Computer and compatible systems . After the break-up of Acorn in 1998 , development of the OS was forked and continued separately by several companies , including RISCOS Ltd , Pace Micro Technology , and Castle Technology . Since then , it has been bundled with several ARM-based desktop computers such as the Iyonix PC and A9home . As of March 2017 [ update ] , the OS remains forked and is independently developed by RISCOS Ltd and the RISC OS Open community . Most recent stable versions run on the ARMv3/ARMv4 RiscPC , the ARMv5 Iyonix , ARMv7 Cortex-A8 processors ( such as that used in the BeagleBoard and Touch Book ) and Cortex-A9 processors ( such as that used in the PandaBoard ) . There is a development version for the Raspberry Pi . SD card images have been released for downloading free of charge to Raspberry Pi 1 , 2 , & 3 users with a full graphical user interface ( GUI ) version and a command-line interface only version ( RISC OS Pico , at 3.8 MB ) . In October 2018 , RISC OS 5 was relicensed under the Apache 2.0 license .",
  "/wiki/Freeware": "Freeware is software , most often proprietary , that is distributed at no monetary cost to the end user . There is no agreed-upon set of rights , license , or EULA that defines freeware unambiguously ; every publisher defines its own rules for the freeware it offers . For instance , modification , redistribution by third parties , and reverse engineering without the author 's permission are permitted by some publishers but prohibited by others . Unlike with free and open-source software , which are also often distributed free of charge , the source code for freeware is typically not made available . Freeware may be intended to benefit its producer by , for example , encouraging sales of a more capable version , as in the freemium and shareware business models .",
  "/wiki/Proprietary_software": "Proprietary software , also known as closed-source software , is non-free computer software for which the software 's publisher or another person retains intellectual property rights - usually copyright of the source code , but sometimes patent rights .",
  "/wiki/Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",
  "/wiki/Cross-platform": "In computing , cross-platform software ( also multi-platform software or platform-independent software ) is computer software that is implemented on multiple computing platforms . Cross-platform software may be divided into two types ; one requires individual building or compilation for each platform that it supports , and the other one can be directly run on any platform without special preparation , e.g. , software written in an interpreted language or pre-compiled portable bytecode for which the interpreters or run-time packages are common or standard components of all platforms . For example , a cross-platform application may run on Microsoft Windows , Linux , and macOS . Cross-platform programs may run on as many as all existing platforms , or on as few as two platforms . Cross-platform frameworks ( such as Qt , Flutter , NativeScript , Xamarin , Phonegap , Ionic , and React Native ) exist to aid cross-platform development .",
  "/wiki/GPLv2": "The GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL or GPL ) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run , study , share , and modify the software . The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF . Developers can omit it when licensing their software ; the Linux kernel , for instance , is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause .",

The Acorn PC card and software allows PC compatible software to be run . Like the Archimedes , the RiscPC continued the practice of having the RISC OS operating system in a ROM module . RiscPC augmented the ROM-based core OS with a disk-based directory structure containing configuration information , and some applications which had previously been kept in ROM . At the 1996 BETT Educational Computing & Technology Awards , the machine was awarded Gold in the hardware category .",
