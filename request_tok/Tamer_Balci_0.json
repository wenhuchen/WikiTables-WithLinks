  "/wiki/Comedy_film": "A comedy film is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humor . These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect . Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending ( black comedy being an exception ) . One of the oldest genres in film - and derived from the classical comedy in theatre - , some of the very first silent movies were comedies , as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions , without requiring sound . When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s , comedy films took another swing , as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue . Comedy , compared with other film genres , puts much more focus on individual stars , with many former stand-up comics transitioning to the film industry due to their popularity . While many comic films are lighthearted stories with no intent other than to amuse , others contain political or social commentary ( such as The King of Comedy and Wag the Dog ) .",

  "/wiki/Drama_film": "In film and television , drama is a genre of narrative fiction ( or semi-fiction ) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone . Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre , such as police crime drama , political drama , legal drama , historical period drama , domestic drama , teen drama or comedy-drama . These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted . Radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance , it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio .",
