  "/wiki/Cardinal-nephew": "A cardinal-nephew ( Latin : cardinalis nepos ; Italian : cardinale nipote ; Spanish : valido de su t\u00edo ; French : prince de fortune ) was a cardinal elevated by a pope who was that cardinal 's relative . The practice of creating cardinal-nephews originated in the Middle Ages , and reached its apex during the 16th and 17th centuries . The last cardinal-nephew was named in 1689 and the practice was extinguished in 1692 . The word nepotism originally referred specifically to this practice , when it appeared in the English language about 1669 . From the middle of the Avignon Papacy ( 1309-1377 ) until Pope Innocent XII 's anti-nepotism bull ( a papal charter ) , Romanum decet pontificem ( 1692 ) , a pope without a cardinal-nephew was the exception to the rule . Every Renaissance pope who created cardinals appointed a relative to the College of Cardinals , and the nephew was the most common choice , although one of Alexander VI 's creations was his own son . The institution of the cardinal-nephew evolved over seven centuries , tracking developments in the history of the papacy and the styles of individual Popes . From 1566 until 1692 , a cardinal-nephew held the curial office of the Superintendent of the Ecclesiastical State , known as the Cardinal Nephew , and thus the terms are sometimes used interchangeably . The curial office of the Cardinal Nephew as well as the institution of the cardinal-nephew declined as the power of the Cardinal Secretary of State increased and the temporal power of popes decreased in the 17th and 18th centuries . The list of cardinal-nephews includes at least fifteen , and possibly as many as nineteen popes ( Gregory IX , Alexander IV , Adrian V , Gregory XI , Boniface IX , Innocent VII , Eugene IV , Paul II , Alexander VI , Pius III , Julius II , Leo X , Clement VII , Benedict XIII , and Pius VII ; perhaps also John XIX and Benedict IX , if they were really promoted cardinals ; as well as Innocent III and Benedict XII , if in fact they were related to their elevators ) ; one antipope ( John XXIII ) ; and two or three saints ( Charles Borromeo , Guarinus of Palestrina , and perhaps Anselm of Lucca , if he was really a cardinal ) .",
  "/wiki/Benefice": "A benefice ( /\u02c8b\u025bn\u026af\u026as/ ) or living is a reward received in exchange for services rendered and as a retainer for future services . The Roman Empire used the Latin term beneficium as a benefit to an individual from the Empire for services rendered . Its use was adopted by the Western Church in the Carolingian Era as a benefit bestowed by the crown or church officials . A benefice specifically from a church is called a precaria ( pl . precariae ) such as a stipend and one from a monarch or nobleman is usually called a fief . A benefice is distinct from an allod , in that an allod is property owned outright , not bestowed by a higher authority .",

After intense politicking by Della Rovere , Cibo was elected pope in 1484 . King Ferrante of Naples had supported Cybo 's competitor , Rodrigo Borgia . The following year , Pope Innocent supported the barons in their failed revolt .

Born into the prominent Borgia family in X\u00e0tiva in the Crown of Aragon , Rodrigo studied law at the University of Bologna . He was ordained deacon and made a cardinal in 1456 after the election of his uncle as Pope Callistus III , and a year later he became vice-chancellor of the Catholic Church . He proceeded to serve in the Curia under the next four popes , acquiring significant influence and wealth in the process . In 1492 , Rodrigo was elected Pope , taking the name Alexander VI . Alexander 's bulls of 1493 confirmed or reconfirmed the rights of the Spanish crown in the New World following the finds of Christopher Columbus in 1492 . During the second Italian war , Alexander VI supported his son Cesare Borgia as a condottiero for the French King . The scope of his foreign policy was to gain the most advantageous terms for his family . Alexander is considered one of the most controversial of the Renaissance popes , partly because he acknowledged fathering several children by his mistresses . As a result , his Italianized Valencian surname , Borgia , became a byword for libertinism and nepotism , which are traditionally considered as characterizing his pontificate . On the other hand , two of Alexander 's successors , Sixtus V and Urban VIII , described him as one of the most outstanding popes since Saint Peter .",

Nicknamed the Warrior Pope or the Fearsome Pope , he chose his papal name not in honour of Pope Julius I but in emulation of Julius Caesar . One of the most powerful and influential popes , Julius II was a central figure of the High Renaissance and left a significant mark in world history . Julius II became Pope in the context of the Italian Wars , a period in which the major powers of Europe fought for primacy in the Italian peninsula . Louis XII of France controlled the Duchy of Milan , previously held by the Sforza , and French influence had replaced that of the Medici in the Republic of Florence . The Kingdom of Naples was under Spanish rule , and the Borja family from Spain was a major political faction in the Papal States following the reign of Alexander VI . The Archduke of Austria Maximilian I was hostile to France and Venice , and desired to descend in Italy in order to obtain the Papal coronation as Holy Roman Emperor . The conclave capitulation preceding his election included several terms , such as the opening of an ecumenical council and the organization of a crusade against the Ottoman Turks . Once crowned , Julius II proclaimed instead his goal to centralize the Papal States ( in large part a patchwork of communes and signorie ) and free Italy from the barbarians . In his early years as Pope , Julius II removed the Borjas from power and exiled them to Spain . Cesare Borgia , Duke of Romagna , shared the same fate and lost his possessions . In 1506 , Julius II initiated the rebuilding of the St. Peter 's Basilica and established the renowned Swiss Guards for his personal protection .",

Born into the prominent political and banking Medici family of Florence , Giovanni was the second son of Lorenzo de ' Medici , ruler of the Florentine Republic , and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1489 . Following the death of Pope Julius II , Giovanni was elected pope after securing the backing of the younger members of the Sacred College . Early on in his rule he oversaw the closing sessions of the Fifth Council of the Lateran , but struggled to implement the reforms agreed . In 1517 he led a costly war that succeeded in securing his nephew as Duke of Urbino , but which reduced papal finances . In Protestant circles , Leo is associated with granting indulgences for those who donated to reconstruct St. Peter 's Basilica , a practice that was soon challenged by Martin Luther 's 95 Theses . He refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the demands of what would become the Protestant Reformation , and his Papal Bull of 1520 , Exsurge Domine , condemned Martin Luther 's condemnatory stance , rendering ongoing communication difficult . He borrowed and spent money without circumspection and was a significant patron of the arts . Under his reign , progress was made on the rebuilding of St. Peter 's Basilica and artists such as Raphael decorated the Vatican rooms . Leo also reorganised the Roman University , and promoted the study of literature , poetry and antiquities . He died in 1521 and is buried in Santa Maria sopra Minerva , Rome .

Cardinal Gerhard M\u00fcller , former prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , wrote in 2015 that the Synod of Bishops is not a part of the Roman Curia in the strict sense : it is the expression of the collegiality of bishops in communion with the Pope and under his direction .

They were among the major states of Italy from roughly the 8th century until the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia successfully unified the Italian Peninsula by conquest in a campaign virtually concluded in 1861 and definitively in 1870 . At their zenith , the Papal States covered most of the modern Italian regions of Lazio ( which includes Rome ) , Marche , Umbria and Romagna , and portions of Emilia . These holdings were considered to be a manifestation of the temporal power of the pope , as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy . By 1861 , much of the Papal States ' territory had been conquered by the Kingdom of Italy . Only Lazio , including Rome , remained under the Pope 's temporal control . In 1870 , the Pope lost Lazio and Rome and had no physical territory at all , except the Basilica of St Peter and the papal residence and related buildings around the Vatican quarter of Rome , which the new Italian state did not occupy militarily . In 1929 the head of the Italian government , at the time the Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini , ended the crisis between unified Italy and the Holy See by negotiating the Lateran Treaty , signed by the two parties .

Born in the Episcopal principality of Utrecht , Adrian studied at the University of Leuven in the Low Countries , where he rose to the position of professor of theology , also serving as rector ( the equivalent of vice-chancellor ) . In 1507 , he became the tutor of the future Holy Roman Emperor Charles V , who later trusted him as both his emissary and his regent .

Adrian came to the papacy in the midst of one of its greatest crises , threatened not only by Lutheranism to the north but also by the advance of the Ottoman Turks to the east . He refused to compromise with Lutheranism theologically , demanding Luther 's condemnation as a heretic . However , he is noted for having attempted to reform the Catholic Church administratively in response to the Protestant Reformation . Adrian 's remarkable admission that the turmoil of the Church was the fault of the Roman Curia itself was read at the 1522-1523 Diet of Nuremberg . His efforts at reform , however , proved fruitless , as they were resisted by most of his Renaissance ecclesiastical contemporaries , and he did not live long enough to see his efforts through to their conclusion .

It was the second-longest papal conclave of the 16th century , and ( at the time ) the largest papal conclave in history in terms of the number of cardinal electors . The cardinal electors ( who at one point totalled fifty-one ) were roughly divided between the factions of Henry II of France , Charles V , Holy Roman Emperor , and Alessandro Farnese , the cardinal-nephew of Paul III . Noted for the extensive interference of European powers , the conclave was to determine whether and on what terms the Council of Trent would reconvene ( supported by Charles V and opposed by Henry II ) and the fate of the Duchies of Parma and Piacenza ( claimed by both Charles V and the House of Farnese ) . Although the conclave nearly elected Reginald Pole , the late arrival of additional French cardinals pushed the conclave back into deadlock , and eventually Giovanni del Monte was elected Pope Julius III as a compromise candidate . The French hoped that Julius III would be hostile to the interests of the Holy Roman Empire . Nevertheless , tensions between him and the French boiled over when he reconvened the Council of Trent in November 1550 , culminating in the threat of schism in August 1551 and the brief War of Parma fought between French troops allied with Ottavio Farnese and a papal-imperial army . French prelates did not attend the 1551-1552 sessions of the Council of Trent and were slow to accept its reforms ; because Henry II would not allow any French cardinals to reside in Rome , many missed the election of Pope Marcellus II , arriving in Rome just in time to elect Marcellus II 's successor Pope Paul IV after Marcellus II 's brief reign .",

While serving as papal nuncio in Spain , he developed an anti-Spanish outlook that later coloured his papacy . A part of the Papal States was invaded by Spain during his papacy and in response to this , he called for a French military intervention . To avoid a conflict at the same time of the Italian War of 1551-1559 , the Papacy and Spain reached a compromise with the Treaty of Cave : French and Spanish forces left the Papal States and the Pope adopted a neutral stance between France and Spain . Carafa was appointed bishop of Chieti , but resigned in 1524 in order to found with St. Cajetan the Congregation of Clerics Regular ( Theatines ) . Recalled to Rome , and made Archbishop of Naples , he was instrumental in setting up the Roman Inquisition , and was opposed to any dialogue with the emerging Protestant party in Europe . Carafa was elected pope in 1555 through the influence of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese in the face of opposition from Emperor Charles V. His papacy was characterized by strong nationalism in reaction to the influence of Philip II of Spain and the Habsburgs . He compelled the Jews of Rome to wear distinctive clothing and confine themselves to a ghetto . The appointment of Carlo Carafa as Cardinal Nephew damaged the papacy further when Paul was forced to remove him from office following a scandal .

  "/wiki/Pope_Innocent_XI": "Pope Innocent XI ( Latin : Innocentius XI ; 16 May 1611 - 12 August 1689 ) , born Benedetto Odescalchi , was Pope from 21 September 1676 to his death on August 12 , 1689 . He is known in Budapest as the Saviour of Hungary . Much of his reign was concerned with tension with Louis XIV of France . A conservative , he lowered taxes in the Papal States during his pontificate and he also produced a surplus in the papal budget . Because of this surplus he repudiated excessive nepotism within the Church . Innocent XI was frugal in matters of governing the Papal States , from dress to leading a life with Christian values . Once he was elected to the Papacy , he applied himself to moral and administrative reform of the Roman Curia . He abolished sinecures and pushed for greater simplicity in preaching as well as greater reverence in worship - requesting this of both the clergy and faithful . After a difficult cause for canonization , starting in 1791 , which caused considerable controversy over the years and which was stopped on several occasions , he was beatified with no opposition [ citation needed ] in 1956 by Pope Pius XII ."
