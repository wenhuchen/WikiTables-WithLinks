Noh is often based on tales from traditional literature with a supernatural being transformed into human form as a hero narrating a story . Noh integrates masks , costumes and various props in a dance-based performance , requiring highly trained actors and musicians . Emotions are primarily conveyed by stylized conventional gestures while the iconic masks represent the roles such as ghosts , women , children , and the elderly . Written in late middle Japanese , the text vividly describes the ordinary people of the twelfth to sixteenth centuries .

The dance is marked by its slow , precise and regal movements . The dancers wear intricate traditional Buddhist costumes , which usually include equally beautiful masks . The music and dance pattern is often repeated several times . It is performed on a square platform , usually 6 yards by 6 yards . Gerald Jonas , in his 2008 book Dancing : The pleasure power and art of movement explains that some bugaku dances depict legendary battles , others enact encounters with divine personages or mythical beasts like the phoenix ; one famous set-piece shows two dragons frolicking ( p. 102 ) . He also discusses the ancient instruction manual that describes precisely the refined movements and postures that gagaku and bugaku performers must attain . Its descriptions often use natural metaphors to describe how their movement should be . For example , the dancers might be encouraged to be like a tree swaying in a cool breeze . Amaterasu , the sun goddess had hidden herself in a cave because she was hurt by her brother Susano-o 's unacceptable behaviour .

Scholars sometimes call its practitioners Shintoists , although adherents rarely use that term themselves . Shinto is polytheistic and revolves around the kami ( gods or spirits ) , supernatural entities believed to inhabit all things . The link between the kami and the natural world has led to Shinto being considered animistic and pantheistic . The kami are worshiped at kamidana household shrines , family shrines , and public shrines . The latter are staffed by priests who oversee offerings to the kami and the provision of religious paraphernalia such as amulets to the religion 's adherents . Other common rituals include the kagura ritual dances , age specific celebrations , and seasonal festivals . These festivals and rituals are collectively called matsuri . A major conceptual focus in Shinto is ensuring purity by cleansing practices of various types including ritual washing or bathing . Shinto does not emphasize specific moral codes other than ritual purity , reverence for kami , and regular communion following seasonal practices .

  "/wiki/Kagura": "The epics Kojiki and Nihon Shoki describe a folktale origin for the dances . In these texts , there is a famous legendary tale about the sun goddess Amaterasu , who retreated into a cave , bringing darkness and cold to the world . Ame-no-Uzume , goddess of the dawn and of revelry , led the other gods in a wild dance , and persuaded Amaterasu to emerge to see what the ruckus was all about . Kagura is one of a number of rituals and arts said to derive from this event . Originally called kamukura or kamikura ( \u795e\u5ea7 ) , kagura began as sacred dances performed at the Imperial court by shrine maidens ( miko ) who were supposedly descendants of Ame-no-Uzume . Over time , however , these Mikagura ( \u5fa1\u795e\u697d ) performed within the sacred and private precincts of the Imperial courts , inspired popular ritual dances , called satokagura ( \u91cc\u795e\u697d ) , which , being popular forms , practiced in villages all around the country , were adapted into various other folk traditions and developed into a number of different forms . Among these are miko kagura , shishi kagura , and Ise-style and Izumo-style kagura dances . Many more variations have developed over the centuries , including some which are fairly new , and most of which have become highly secularized folk traditions . Kagura , in particular those forms that involve storytelling or reenactment of fables , is also one of the primary influences on the Noh theatre .",

  "/wiki/Hayashi_(music)": "A hayashi ( \u56c3\u5b50 ) is a group of performers who provide musical accompaniment for Japanese Noh or kabuki theatre , yose ( \u5bc4\u5e2d ) performances of rakugo , or a festival . In Noh , the hayashi sit along the rear of the stage , facing the audience and fully visible . A distinct and separate group of performers from the chorus , they are purely instrumentalists ; the type of instruments featured and the order in which they sit on stage follow established practices . The leftmost performer plays a small taiko , set on a stand before him , with two drumsticks . To his right is the \u014dtsuzumi hip drum , followed by the kotsuzumi shoulder drum , and the Noh flute ( n\u014dkan or simply fue ) . In kabuki , a number of shamisen players are added , along with , depending on the play , taiko drums of various sizes , various types of flutes , and other instruments , including a myriad of devices for sound effects . The kabuki hayashi is generally located in a small room just off-stage , and is not visible to the audience , though a barred window in the walls of the stage set indicates its location . For matsubame plays and dances , those based on works from Noh and ky\u014dgen , the hayashi will often be located along the rear of the stage , fully visible in imitation of Noh and ky\u014dgen modes . As with kabuki actors , and other performers in traditional arts , instrumentalists in the traditions of Noh hayashi , kabuki hayashi , and nagauta shamisen ( the shamisen style used in kabuki and bunraku ) , are members of a number of traditional lineages , following the iemoto system . Performers traditionally take on the name of their school as an art-name ( i.e . stage name ) . Notable hayashi lineages include the T\u014dsha school , Mochizuki school , and Tanaka school .",
  "/wiki/\u014cdaiko": "The origin of the instruments is unclear , though there have been many suggestions . Historical accounts , of which the earliest date from 588 CE , note that young Japanese men traveled to Korea to study the kakko , a drum that originated in South China . This study and appropriation of Chinese instruments may have influenced the emergence of taiko . Certain court music styles , especially gigaku and gagaku , arrived in Japan through both Korea and China . In both traditions , dancers were accompanied by several instruments that included drums similar to taiko . Certain percussive patterns and terminology in togaku , an early dance and music style in Japan , in addition to physical features of the kakko , also reflect influence from both China and India on drum use in gagaku performance . Archaeological evidence shows that taiko were used in Japan as early as the 6th century CE , during the latter part of the Kofun period , and were likely used for communication , in festivals , and in other rituals . This evidence was substantiated by the discovery of haniwa statues in the Sawa District of Gunma Prefecture . Two of these figures are depicted playing drums ; one of them , wearing skins , is equipped with a barrel-shaped drum hung from his shoulder and uses a stick to play the drum at hip height . This statue is titled Man Beating the Taiko and is considered the oldest evidence of taiko performance in Japan . Similarities between the playing style demonstrated by this haniwa and known music traditions in Korea and China further suggest influences from these regions . The Nihon Shoki , the second oldest book of Japanese classical history , contains a mythological story describing the origin of taiko .",
