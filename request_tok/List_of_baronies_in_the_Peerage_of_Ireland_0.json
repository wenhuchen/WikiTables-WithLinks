  "/wiki/Baron_Kingsale": "Baron Kingsale is a title in the Peerage of Ireland , that of the premier baron in that peerage . The feudal barony dates to at least the thirteenth century . The first peerage creation was by writ . The numbering of the barons varies , some sources including the holders of the feudal barony , others commencing with the peers from 1340 , and still others from 1397 ; a licence of that year issued to the fourth peer has often been mistaken for a patent creating the peerage , but this is not the case . This article follows the numbering of The Complete Peerage . The Baron also holds the feudal titles of Lord Courcy and Lord Ringrone , probably created in the twelfth century . Several sources claim that the Baron holds the privilege of being covered ( that is , wearing a hat ) in the presence of the monarch . The Eleventh Edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica , however , disagrees , claiming that the story is a legend without historic foundation . Despite the antiquity of the title , the family no longer retains its property or wealth , having supported the losing side in past conflicts ; the 30th ( or 35th ) Baron , despite education at Stowe and the Universities of Paris and Salzburg due to his father 's marriage to the daughter of a Yorkshire lanolin oil business , was , due to the failure of that business , amongst other things , an odd-job man and plumber , and died a resident of sheltered housing .",

  "/wiki/Baron_Power": "The Earl of Tyrone is a title created three times in the Peerage of Ireland . It was first created as part of the Tudor attempt to establish a uniform social structure in Ireland by converting the Gaelic kings and chiefs into hereditary nobles of the Kingdom of Ireland . Under brehon law , clans were effectively independent , and chose their chiefs from the members of a bloodline - normally , but not always , a close relative of the previous chief ; the clan as a whole generally had a voice in the chief 's decisions . Also , acknowledged sons of a clan member were members of the bloodline , even when not begotten in lawful marriage . The holder of a title , on the other hand , was subject to the Crown , but held his lands by hereditary right , which the Crown would help to enforce ; the rest of the clan were usually now his tenants . Illegitimate sons had no right of succession under the new system unless expressly granted . The title in the Peerage of Ireland was created again in 1673 for Richard Power , 6th Baron Power , the Anglo-Norman peer and Restoration politician , along with a large grant of land in County Waterford , at the other end of Ireland . He was also given the subordinate title of Viscount Decies ; both titles became extinct upon the death of his younger son , the third earl , in 1704 ; he left an only daughter , Lady Katherine Power , but both titles descended by patent to male heirs only . It was created a final time in 1746 for Marcus Beresford , 1st Viscount Tyrone , son-in-law of the last Power earl . His son was created Marquess of Waterford in 1789 , and the title has since been a subsidiary title of the Waterford title .",

  "/wiki/Baron_Offaly": "There have been two creations of the title Baron Offaly , both in the Peerage of Ireland . Two earlier medieval creations as Baron of Offaly existed for an earlier FitzGerald , who owned land in County Kildare , Ireland , including what was then Offelan , a word that derived from the Irish U\u00ed Faelain and not from what is now County Offaly . The original grant of the lordship of Offelan was in 1175 to Maurice FitzGerald , one of Strongbow 's main supporters . In 1538-50 the title was recreated for Brian O Conor Faly , who was based in neighbouring County Offaly . The first modern creation by Queen Mary I was for Gerald FitzGerald on 13 May 1554 , who was also created Earl of Kildare at the same time and later restored to the senior earldom of Kildare ( forfeit by his half-brother , Thomas ) in 1569 . The title ( as well as the second creation of the earldom ) , became extinct in 1599 when the 13th earl 's branch of the family became extinct and the senior earldom passed to his cousin , Gerald . The second creation of the title was for Lettice Digby on 29 July 1620 . She was the daughter of Gerald FitzGerald , Lord Offally ( 1559-1580 ; the eldest son of the 11th earl , who predeceased his father ) and the wife of Sir Robert Digby . Her eldest son , Robert , was created Baron Digby on the same day . The patent of the barony stipulated that it was not to pass to Lord Digby , but instead to the head of the House of Kildare , who , at the time of Baroness Offaly 's death in 1658 , was George FitzGerald , 16th Earl of Kildare . The 20th earl was later created Duke of Leinster in 1766 and the dukedom and barony remain united .",
  "/wiki/List_of_kings_of_U\u00ed_Failghe": "U\u00ed Failghe seems to have existed as a kingdom in Ireland since at least the early historic era , and successfully fought off encroachments by the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill , the E\u00f3ganachta , and most especially the Normans . From the mid eleventh century its dynasty adopted the surname Ua Conchobhair Failghe , or O Connor Faly ( they were unrelated to the other notable Ua Conchobhair dynasties of Connacht and Kerry ) . Their seat was originally in Rathangan , County Kildare but moved to Daingean with the Norman arrival . In the 1530s Brian supported the revolt of Silken Thomas ; on his defeat he was pardoned and was given the title Baron of Offaly . On the death of the last de facto king , and de jure baron , Brian mac Cathaoir O Conchobhair Failghe , in about 1556 , U\u00ed Failghe was split between the modern day counties of King 's County ( Offaly ) , Queen 's County ( Laois ) and County Kildare by Mary I of England during the Plantations of Ireland . Two Baronies in County Kildare , Offaly East and Offaly West , retained the anglicised name of the Kingdom . Upon Irish independence King 's County was renamed as County Offaly ."
