  "/wiki/Pentecostal": "Pentecostalism or Classical Pentecostalism is a Protestant Christian movement that emphasises direct personal experience of God through baptism with the Holy Spirit . The term Pentecostal is derived from Pentecost , the Greek name for the Jewish Feast of Weeks . For Christians , this event commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the followers of Jesus Christ , as described in the second chapter of the Acts of the Apostles . Like other forms of evangelical Protestantism , Pentecostalism adheres to the inerrancy of the Bible and the necessity of accepting Jesus Christ as personal Lord and Savior . It is distinguished by belief in the baptism in the Holy Spirit that enables a Christian to live a Spirit-filled and empowered life . This empowerment includes the use of spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and divine healing - two other defining characteristics of Pentecostalism . Because of their commitment to biblical authority , spiritual gifts , and the miraculous , Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the Apostolic Age of the early church . For this reason , some Pentecostals also use the term Apostolic or Full Gospel to describe their movement . Pentecostalism emerged in the early 20th century among radical adherents of the Holiness movement who were energized by revivalism and expectation for the imminent Second Coming of Christ . Believing that they were living in the end times , they expected God to spiritually renew the Christian Church thereby bringing to pass the restoration of spiritual gifts and the evangelization of the world . In 1900 , Charles Parham , an American evangelist and faith healer , began teaching that speaking in tongues was the Bible evidence of Spirit baptism and along with William J. Seymour , a Wesleyan-Holiness preacher , he taught that this was the third work of grace . The three-year-long Azusa Street Revival , founded and led by Seymour in Los Angeles , California , resulted in the spread of Pentecostalism throughout the United States and the rest of the world as visitors carried the Pentecostal experience back to their home churches or felt called to the mission field .",
  "/wiki/Greek_Orthodox_Church": "The name Greek Orthodox Church ( Greek : \u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03c1\u03b8\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03be\u03b7 \u1f19\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 , Ellinorth\u00f3doxi Ekklis\u00eda , IPA : [ elinor\u02c8\u03b8o\u00f0oksi ekli\u02c8sia ] ) , or Greek Orthodoxy , is a term referring to the body of several Churches within the larger communion of Eastern Orthodox Christianity , whose liturgy is or was traditionally conducted in Koine Greek , the original language of the Septuagint and the New Testament , and whose history , traditions , and theology are rooted in the early Church Fathers and the culture of the Byzantine Empire . Greek Orthodox Christianity has also traditionally placed heavy emphasis and awarded high prestige to traditions of Eastern Orthodox monasticism and asceticism , with origins in Early Christianity in the Near East and in Byzantine Anatolia . Historically , the term Greek Orthodox has also been used to describe all Eastern Orthodox Churches in general , since Greek in Greek Orthodox can refer to the heritage of the Byzantine Empire . During the first eight centuries of Christian history , most major intellectual , cultural , and social developments in the Christian Church took place within the Empire or in the sphere of its influence , where the Greek language was widely spoken and used for most theological writings . Over time , most parts of the liturgy , traditions , and practices of the church of Constantinople were adopted by all , and still provide the basic patterns of contemporary Orthodoxy . Thus , the Eastern Church came to be called Greek Orthodox in the same way that the Western Church is called Roman Catholic . However , the appellation Greek was abandoned by the Slavic and other Eastern Orthodox churches in connection with their peoples ' national awakenings , from as early as the 10th century A.D . Thus , today it is generally only those churches that are most closely tied to Greek or Byzantine culture that are called Greek Orthodox .",

  "/wiki/Assemblies_of_God": "The Assemblies of God ( AG ) , officially the World Assemblies of God Fellowship , is a group of over 144 autonomous self-governing associated national groupings of churches which together form the world 's largest Pentecostal denomination . It is the fourth largest international Christian group of denominations and the largest Pentecostal denomination in the world . As an international fellowship , the member denominations are entirely independent and autonomous ; however , they are united by shared beliefs and history . The Assemblies originated from the Azusa Street Revival of the early 20th century . This revival led to the founding of the Assemblies of God in the United States in 1914 . Through foreign missionary work and establishing relationships with other Pentecostal churches , the Assemblies of God expanded into a worldwide movement . It was not until 1988 , however , that the world fellowship was formed . As a Pentecostal fellowship , the Assemblies of God believes in the Pentecostal distinctive of baptism with the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues . The Assemblies of God should not be confused with the Assemblies of God International Fellowship , the International Assemblies of God Fellowship , and the Independent Assemblies of God International , all of which are Pentecostal denominations .",
  "/wiki/Quakers": "Quakers , also called Friends , are a historically Christian group whose formal name is the Religious Society of Friends or Friends Church . Members of the various Quaker movements are all generally united by their belief in the ability of each human being to experientially access the light within , or that of God in every one . Some may profess the priesthood of all believers , a doctrine derived from the First Epistle of Peter . They include those with evangelical , holiness , liberal , and traditional Quaker understandings of Christianity . There are also Nontheist Quakers whose spiritual practice is not reliant on the existence of God . To differing extents , the different movements that make up the Religious Society of Friends/Friends Church avoid creeds and hierarchical structures . In 2007 , there were about 359,000 adult Quakers worldwide . In 2017 , there were 377,557 adult Quakers , with 49% in Africa . Around 89% of Quakers worldwide belong to the evangelical and programmed branches of Quakerism - these Quakers worship in services with singing and a prepared message from the Bible , coordinated by a pastor . Around 11% of Friends practice waiting worship , or unprogrammed worship ( more commonly known today as Meeting for Worship ) , where the order of service is not planned in advance , is predominantly silent , and may include unprepared vocal ministry from those present . Some meetings of both types have Recorded Ministers in their meetings - Friends recognised for their gift of vocal ministry . The first Quakers lived in mid-17th-century England ."
