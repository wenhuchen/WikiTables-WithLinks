  "/wiki/Verrucomicrobia": "Verrucomicrobia is a phylum of bacteria . This phylum contains only a few described species ( Verrucomicrobium spinosum , is an example , the phylum is named after this ) . The species identified have been isolated from fresh water , marine and soil environments and human faeces . A number of as-yet uncultivated species have been identified in association with eukaryotic hosts including extrusive explosive ectosymbionts of protists and endosymbionts of nematodes residing in their gametes . While verrucae is another name for the warts often found on hands and feet , this phylum is so called not because it is a causative agent thereof , but because of its wart-like morphology . Evidence suggests that verrucomicrobia are abundant within the environment , and important ( especially to soil cultures ) . This phylum is considered to have two sister phyla : Chlamydiae and Lentisphaerae within the PVC group . The Verrucomicrobia phylum can be distinguished from neighbouring phyla within the PVC group by the presence of several conserved signature indels ( CSIs ) . These CSIs represent unique , synapomorphic characteristics that suggest common ancestry within Verrucomicrobia and an independent lineage amidst other bacteria . CSIs have also been found that are shared by Verrucomicrobia and Chlamydiae exclusively of all other bacteria . These CSIs provide evidence that Chlamydiae is the closest relative to Verrucomicrobia , and that they are more closely related to one another than to the Planctomycetales . Cavalier-Smith has postulated that the Verrucomicrobia belong in the clade Planctobacteria in the larger clade Gracilicutes .",
  "/wiki/Chlamydia_(bacterium)": "Chlamydia is a genus of pathogenic bacteria that are obligate intracellular parasites . Chlamydia infections are the most common bacterial sexually transmitted diseases in humans and are the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide . Species include Chlamydia trachomatis ( a human pathogen ) , Ch . suis ( affects only swine ) , and Ch . muridarum ( affects only mice and hamsters ) . Humans mainly contract Ch . trachomatis , Ch . pneumoniae , Ch . abortus , and Ch . psittaci .",
  "/wiki/Chlamydia_muridarum": "Chlamydia muridarum is an intracellular bacterial species that at one time belonged to Chlamydia trachomatis . However , C. trachomatis naturally only infects humans and C. muridarum naturally infects only members of the family Muridae ( includes both mice and hamsters , Alderton , 1996 ) . Two strains of Chlamydia muridarum , MoPn ( originally named Nigg ) and SFPD , have been isolated from mice and hamsters . Glycogen production by both strains has been demonstrated . The chromosome and extrachromosomal plasmid of MoPn have been sequenced . Chlamydia muridarum MoPn binds mAbs recognizing Chlamydia trachomatis MOMP vs4 core epitope ( T ) LNPT ( IA ) . DNA sequence analysis indicates that these mAbs should recognize SFPD and that Chlamydia trachomatis B-serogroup mAbs specific for the vs4 epitope IAGAG should recognize SFPD . MoPn was isolated in 1942 from the lungs of asymptomatic albino Swiss mice and was subsequently shown to be capable of producing disease in mice . SFPD was obtained from a hamster , concurrent with a causative agent of proliferative ileitis . MoPn has been shown to be sensitive to sulfadiazine . In contrast to chlamydia trachomatis , chlamydia muridarum lacks a tryptophan operon . Due to this , chlamydia muridarum responds to interferon gamma ( IFN-\u03b3 ) differently than chlamydia trachomatis , which effects the degree to which the two different chlamydia strains are inhibited in infected mice and humans , respectively .",
  "/wiki/Chlamydiae": "The Chlamydiae are bacterial phylum and class whose members are a group of obligate intracellular bacteria , whose members are remarkably diverse , ranging from pathogens of humans and animals to symbionts of ubiquitous protozoa . They are ovoid in shape and stain Gram-negative . Historically it was believed that all Chlamydiae species had a peptidoglycan-free cell wall , but recent work demonstrates a detectable presence of peptidoglycan , as well as other important proteins . Many species belonging to this order are susceptible to antimicrobial agents . All known Chlamydiae only grow by infecting eukaryotic host cells . They are as small as or smaller than many viruses . They are dependent on replication inside the host cells , thus some species are termed obligate intracellular pathogens and others are symbionts of ubiquitous protozoa . Most intracellular Chlamydiae are located in an inclusion body or vacuole . Outside cells , they survive only as an extracellular infectious form . Chlamydiae can grow only where their host cells grow , and develop according to a characteristic biphasic developmental cycle . Therefore , Chlamydiae can not be propagated in bacterial culture media in the clinical laboratory . Chlamydiae are most successfully isolated while still inside their host cells .",
  "/wiki/Chlamydia_trachomatis": "Chlamydia trachomatis ( /kl\u0259\u02c8m\u026adi\u0259 tr\u0259\u02c8ko\u028am\u0259t\u026as/ ) , commonly known as chlamydia , is a bacterium that causes chlamydia , which can manifest in various ways , including : trachoma , lymphogranuloma venereum , nongonococcal urethritis , cervicitis , salpingitis , pelvic inflammatory disease . C. trachomatis is the most common infectious cause of blindness and the most common sexually transmitted bacterium . Different types of C. trachomatis cause different diseases . The most common strains cause disease in the genital tract , while other strains cause disease in the eye or lymph nodes . Like other Chlamydia species , the C. trachomatis life cycle consists of two morphologically distinct life stages : elementary bodies and reticulate bodies . Elementary bodies are spore-like and infectious , whereas reticulate bodies are the replicative stage and are seen only within host cells .",

  "/wiki/Chlamydophila_abortus": "Chlamydia abortus is a species in Chlamydiae that causes abortion and fetal death in mammals , including humans . Chlamydia abortus was renamed in 1999 as Chlamydophila psittaci along with all Chlamydiae except Chlamydia trachomatis . This was based on a lack of evident glycogen production and on resistance to the antibiotic sulfadiazine . In 1999 C. psittaci and C. abortus were recognized as distinct species based on differences of pathogenicity and DNA-DNA hybridization . In 2015 , this new name was reverted to Chlamydia .",
  "/wiki/Chlamydophila_caviae": "Chlamydia caviae is a bacterium that can be recovered from the conjunctiva of Guinea pigs suffering from ocular inflammation and eye discharge . It is also possible to infect the genital tract of Guinea pigs with C. caviae and elicit a disease that is very similar to human Chlamydia trachomatis infection . C. caviae infects primarily the mucosal epithelium and is not invasive . C. caviae is markedly specific for Guinea pigs , as attempts to infect mice , hamsters , rabbits and gerbils have been unsuccessful , except for one experimentally infected gerbil . The five known C. caviae isolates are indistinguishable , based on ompA gene sequence .",
  "/wiki/Chlamydophila_felis": "Chlamydia felis ( formerly Chlamydophila felis and before that Chlamydia psittaci var . felis ) is a bacterium endemic among domestic cats worldwide , primarily causing inflammation of feline conjunctiva , rhinitis and respiratory problems . C. felis can be recovered from the stomach and reproductive tract . Zoonotic infection of humans with C. felis has been reported . Strains FP Pring and FP Cello have an extrachromosomal plasmid , whereas the FP Baker strain does not . FP Cello produces lethal disease in mice , whereas the FP Baker does not . An attenuated FP Baker strain , and an attenuated 905 strain , are used as live vaccines for cats .",
  "/wiki/Chlamydophila_pneumoniae": "Chlamydia pneumoniae is a species of Chlamydia , an obligate intracellular bacterium that infects humans and is a major cause of pneumonia . It was known as the Taiwan acute respiratory agent ( TWAR ) from the names of the two original isolates - Taiwan ( TW-183 ) and an acute respiratory isolate designated AR-39 . Briefly , it was known as Chlamydophila pneumoniae , and that name is used as an alternate in some sources . In some cases , to avoid confusion , both names are given . C. pneumoniae has a complex life cycle and must infect another cell to reproduce ; thus , it is classified as an obligate intracellular pathogen . The full genome sequence for C. pneumoniae was published in 1999 . It also infects and causes disease in koalas , emerald tree boas ( Corallus caninus ) , iguanas , chameleons , frogs , and turtles . The first known case of infection with C. pneumoniae was a case of conjunctivitis in Taiwan in 1950 . There are no known cases of C. pneumoniae in human history before 1950 . This atypical bacterium commonly causes pharyngitis , bronchitis , coronary artery disease and atypical pneumonia in addition to several other possible diseases ."
