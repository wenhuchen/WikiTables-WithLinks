  "/wiki/Aleppo": "Aleppo ( /\u0259\u02c8l\u025bpo\u028a/ ; Arabic : \ufea3\u064e\ufee0\u064e\ufe90 / ALA-LC : \u1e24alab , IPA : [ \u02c8\u0127alab ] ; French : Alep ) is a city in Syria , which serves as the capital of the Aleppo Governorate , the most populous Syrian governorate . With an official population of 4.6 million in 2010 , Aleppo was the largest Syrian city before the Syrian Civil War ; however , it is now the second-largest city in Syria , after the capital Damascus . [ citation needed ] Aleppo is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world ; it may have been inhabited since the 6th millennium BC . Excavations at Tell as-Sawda and Tell al-Ansari , just south of the old city of Aleppo , show that the area was occupied by Amorites by the latter part of the 3rd millennium BC . That is also the time at which Aleppo is first mentioned in cuneiform tablets unearthed in Ebla and Mesopotamia , which speak of it as part of the Amorite state of Yamhad , and note its commercial and military proficiency . Such a long history is attributed to its strategic location as a trading center midway between the Mediterranean Sea and Mesopotamia . For centuries , Aleppo was the largest city in the Syrian region , and the Ottoman Empire 's third-largest after Constantinople and Cairo . The city 's significance in history has been its location at one end of the Silk Road , which passed through Central Asia and Mesopotamia . When the Suez Canal was inaugurated in 1869 , much trade was diverted to sea and Aleppo began its slow decline . At the fall of the Ottoman Empire after World War I , Aleppo lost its northern hinterland to modern Turkey , as well as the important Baghdad Railway connecting it to Mosul . In the 1940s it lost its main access to the sea , Antakya and \u0130skenderun , likewise to Turkey . Finally , the isolation of Syria in the past few decades further exacerbated the situation .",
