It is one of the eight U.S. uniformed services , and is designated as the Army of the United States in the U.S. Constitution . As the oldest and most senior branch of the U.S. military in order of precedence , the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army , which was formed ( 14 June 1775 ) to fight the American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) - before the United States of America was established as a country . After the Revolutionary War , the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784 to replace the disbanded Continental Army . The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army , and considers its institutional inception to be the origin of that armed force in 1775 . As a uniformed military service , the U.S. Army is part of the Department of the Army , which is one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense . The U.S. Army is headed by a civilian senior appointed civil servant , the secretary of the Army ( SECARMY ) and by a chief military officer , the chief of staff of the Army ( CSA ) who is also a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . It is the largest military branch , and in the fiscal year 2017 , the projected end strength for the Regular Army ( USA ) was 476,000 soldiers ; the Army National Guard ( ARNG ) had 343,000 soldiers and the U.S. Army Reserve ( USAR ) had 199,000 soldiers ; the combined-component strength of the U.S. Army was 1,018,000 soldiers .

The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan .

The American invasion , designated Operation Detachment , had the goal of capturing the entire island , including the three Japanese-controlled airfields ( including the South Field and the Central Field ) , to provide a staging area for attacks on the Japanese main islands . This five-week battle comprised some of the fiercest and bloodiest fighting of the Pacific War of World War II . After the heavy losses incurred in the battle , the strategic value of the island became controversial . It was useless to the U.S. Army as a staging base and useless to the U.S. Navy as a fleet base . However , Navy Seabees rebuilt the landing strips , which were used as emergency landing strips for USAAF B-29s . The IJA positions on the island were heavily fortified , with a dense network of bunkers , hidden artillery positions , and 18 km ( 11 mi ) of tunnels . The American ground forces were supported by extensive naval artillery , and had complete air supremacy provided by U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aviators throughout the battle . Japanese combat deaths numbered three times the number of American deaths although , uniquely among Pacific War Marine battles , American total casualties ( dead and wounded ) exceeded those of the Japanese . Of the 21,000 Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima at the beginning of the battle , only 216 were taken prisoner , some of whom were captured because they had been knocked unconscious or otherwise disabled . The majority of the remainder were killed in action , although it has been estimated that as many as 3,000 continued to resist within the various cave systems for many days afterwards , eventually succumbing to their injuries or surrendering weeks later . Despite the bloody fighting and severe casualties on both sides , the American victory was assured from the start .",

The operation began the liberation of German-occupied France ( and later western Europe ) and laid the foundations of the Allied victory on the Western Front . Planning for the operation began in 1943 . In the months leading up to the invasion , the Allies conducted a substantial military deception , codenamed Operation Bodyguard , to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings . The weather on D-Day was far from ideal , and the operation had to be delayed 24 hours ; a further postponement would have meant a delay of at least two weeks , as the invasion planners had requirements for the phase of the moon , the tides , and the time of day that meant only a few days each month were deemed suitable . Adolf Hitler placed German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in command of German forces and of developing fortifications along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion . The amphibious landings were preceded by extensive aerial and naval bombardment and an airborne assault - the landing of 24,000 American , British , and Canadian airborne troops shortly after midnight . Allied infantry and armoured divisions began landing on the coast of France at 06:30 .

  "/wiki/Farm_Security_Administration": "The Farm Security Administration ( FSA ) was a New Deal agency created in 1937 to combat rural poverty during the Great Depression in the United States . It succeeded the Resettlement Administration ( 1935-1937 ) . The FSA is famous for its small but highly influential photography program , 1935-44 , that portrayed the challenges of rural poverty . The photographs in the Farm Security Administration/Office of War Information Photograph Collection form an extensive pictorial record of American life between 1935 and 1944 . This U.S. government photography project was headed for most of its existence by Roy E. Stryker , who guided the effort in a succession of government agencies : the Resettlement Administration ( 1935-1937 ) , the Farm Security Administration ( 1937-1942 ) , and the Office of War Information ( 1942-1944 ) . The collection also includes photographs acquired from other governmental and non-governmental sources , including the News Bureau at the Offices of Emergency Management ( OEM ) , various branches of the military , and industrial corporations . In total , the black-and-white portion of the collection consists of about 175,000 black-and-white film negatives , encompassing both negatives that were printed for FSA-OWI use and those that were not printed at the time . Color transparencies also made by the FSA/OWI are available in a separate section of the catalog : FSA/OWI Color Photographs . The FSA stressed rural rehabilitation efforts to improve the lifestyle of very poor landowning farmers , and a program to purchase submarginal land owned by poor farmers and resettle them in group farms on land more suitable for efficient farming . Reactionary critics , including the Farm Bureau , strongly opposed the FSA as an alleged experiment in collectivizing agriculture - that is , in bringing farmers together to work on large government-owned farms using modern techniques under the supervision of experts . After the Conservative coalition took control of Congress it transformed the FSA into a program to help poor farmers buy land , and that program continues to operate in the 21st century as the Farmers Home Administration ."
