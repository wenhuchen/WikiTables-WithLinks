  "/wiki/English_language": "English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and eventually became a global lingua franca . It is named after the Angles , one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name , as England . Both names derive from Anglia , a peninsula in the Baltic Sea . The language is closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon , and its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages , particularly Norse ( a North Germanic language ) , and to a greater extent by Latin and French . English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . The earliest forms of English , a group of West Germanic ( Ingvaeonic ) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century , are collectively called Old English . Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England ; this was a period in which the language was influenced by French . Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London , the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift . Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States . Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science , navigation and law . English is the largest language by number of speakers , and the third most-spoken native language in the world , after Standard Chinese and Spanish . It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states .",

  "/wiki/Great_Patriotic_War": "The Eastern Front of World War II was a theatre of conflict between the European Axis powers and co-belligerent Finland against the Soviet Union ( USSR ) , Poland and other Allies , which encompassed Central Europe , Eastern Europe , Northeast Europe ( Baltics ) , and Southeast Europe ( Balkans ) from 22 June 1941 to 9 May 1945 .

The battles on the Eastern Front of the Second World War constituted the largest military confrontation in history . They were characterised by unprecedented ferocity , wholesale destruction , mass deportations , and immense loss of life due to combat , starvation , exposure , disease , and massacres . The Eastern Front , as the site of nearly all extermination camps , death marches , ghettos , and the majority of pogroms , was central to the Holocaust . Of the estimated 70-85 million deaths attributed to World War II , around 30 million occurred on the Eastern Front . The Eastern Front was decisive in determining the outcome in the European theatre of operations in World War II , eventually serving as the main reason for the defeat of Nazi Germany and the Axis nations . The two principal belligerent powers were Germany and the Soviet Union , along with their respective allies . Though never engaged in military action in the Eastern Front , the United States and the United Kingdom both provided substantial material aid in the form of the Lend-Lease to the Soviet Union . The joint German-Finnish operations across the northernmost Finnish-Soviet border and in the Murmansk region are considered part of the Eastern Front . In addition , the Soviet-Finnish Continuation War may also be considered the northern flank of the Eastern Front .",

  "/wiki/Resistance_during_World_War_II": "Resistance movements during World War II occurred in every occupied country by a variety of means , ranging from non-cooperation to propaganda to hiding crashed pilots and even to outright warfare and the recapturing of towns .

Many countries had resistance movements dedicated to fighting or undermining the Axis invaders , and Nazi Germany itself also had an anti-Nazi movement . Although Britain was not occupied during the war , the British made complex preparations for a British resistance movement . The main organisation was created by the Secret Intelligence Service ( SIS , aka MI6 ) and is now known as Section VII . In addition there was a short-term secret commando force called the Auxiliary Units . Various organizations were also formed to establish foreign resistance cells or support existing resistance movements , like the British Special Operations Executive and the American Office of Strategic Services ( the forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency ) . There were also resistance movements fighting against the Allied invaders . In Italian East Africa , after the Italian forces were defeated during the East African Campaign , some Italians participated in a guerrilla war against the British ( 1941-1943 ) . The German Nazi resistance movement ( Werwolf ) never amounted to much . The Forest Brothers of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania included many fighters who operated against the Soviet occupation of the Baltic States into the 1960s .",

Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants , the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century . In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire , beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium . Rus ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states , until it was finally reunified by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th century . By the 18th century , the nation had greatly expanded through conquest , annexation , and exploration to become the Russian Empire , which was the third largest empire in history , stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east . Following the Russian Revolution , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) became the largest and leading constituent of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR/Soviet Union ) , the world 's first constitutionally socialist state .",

Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s .

  "/wiki/Soviet_Union": "The Soviet Union , [ b ] officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR or \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 ) , [ c ] was a federal sovereign state in northern Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991 . Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas ."
