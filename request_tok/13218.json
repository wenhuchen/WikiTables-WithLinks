The National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs ( NL ) was formed in Chicago , Illinois by businessman , and owner of the Chicago White Stockings ( now known as , the Chicago Cubs ) , William Hulbert , for the purpose of replacing the NA , which he believed to have been corrupt , mismanaged , full of rowdy , drunken ballplayers , and under the influence of the gambling community . One of the new rules put into place by the new league was that all teams had to be located in cities that had a population of 75,000 or more . The initial NL season began with eight teams , and they were asked to play seventy games between April 22 and October 21 . The NL is considered to be the first major league , although it has been argued that the NA can make that claim .",

  "/wiki/St._Louis_Brown_Stockings": "The St. Louis Brown Stockings were a professional baseball club based in St. Louis , Missouri , from 1875 to 1877 , which competed on the cusps of the existences of two all-professional leagues -- the National Association ( NA ) and the National League ( NL ) . The team is the forerunner of , but not directly connected with , the current St. Louis Cardinals Major League Baseball team . After the conclusion of the 1877 season , a game-fixing scandal involving two players the Brown Stockings had acquired led the team to resign its membership in the NL . The club then declared bankruptcy and folded . The Brown Stockings did not meet a complete demise , however . Organized by outfielder Ned Cuthbert , a few members of the former club continued to play the following year , though not now bound to any league . They played whomever they could , wherever they could , and still managed to draw crowds and make a profit , leading to play again the following two years . The Brown Stockings regained some of their former success - enough of it that , despite the recent scandal , fans of the team seemed to exhibit a short memory and began to show interest in recreating another professional St. Louis baseball team . In 1881 , when German immigrant Chris von der Ahe - owner of a grocery store and saloon who was initially ignorant about baseball - saw the popularity of the club , he bought them out and soon became interested in having the team compete in a professional league . Together with beer magnates in five other cities , the American Association was formed in late 1881 , and professional baseball flourished in St. Louis - this time , with the resurrected Brown Stockings the next year .",

He is best known for the speed in which he pitched a baseball . The velocity of his fastball was unknown , but it has been estimated that he threw it in the mid to upper 90s .

In 1897 one of his fastballs struck future Hall of Famer Hughie Jennings in the head , rendering him comatose for four days before recovery .

  "/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles_(19th_century)": "The Baltimore Orioles were a 19th-century American Association and National League ( organized 1876 ) baseball team from 1882 to 1899 . The early ball club , which featured numerous future Hall of Famers , finished in first place three consecutive years ( 1894-1895-1896 ) and won the Temple Cup national championship series in 1896 and 1897 . Despite their success , the dominant Orioles were contracted out of the League after the 1899 season , when the N.L . reduced its number of teams and franchises from 12 to 8 , with a list of teams and cities limited to just the northeastern United States which endured for the next half-century . This controversial action resulting in the elevation of the former Western League by leaders such as Ban Johnson ( 1864-1931 ) , into a newly-organized American League in 1901 of which the new reorganized Baltimore Orioles were a prominent member for its first two seasons which waged war on the elder Nationals ."
