  "/wiki/Motorola_Aura": "Motorola Aura ( styled AURA ) is a series of luxury mobile phones from Motorola , and is part of the 4LTR line , announced in October 2008 and made available by December . Though it was going to be a series , only one phone was released , known as Aura R1 . However , three further special editions of the Aura R1 were released through 2009 : Aura Diamoniqe Edition , Aura Celestial Edition and Aura Diamond Edition . Aura is a luxury device with US $ 2000 price tag . It is made from premium materials such as stainless steel and sapphire and comes inside a wooden box . The phone featured a unique high-resolution circular display with 300dpi and an adapted circular user interfaced based on Motorola 's MotoMagx operating system . One of the main selling points of the device apart from its screen was its swivel-like opening mechanism . This was thanks to its Swiss-made gears composed of Rockwell 50-55 hardened steel and 130 precision ball bearings . Its custom-engineered rotating mechanism is composed of more than 200 high-precision individual parts , and the gears are protected against harsh conditions with the same coatings used in high-performance racing engines .",
  "/wiki/GSM": "The Global System for Mobile Communications ( GSM ) is a standard developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute ( ETSI ) to describe the protocols for second-generation ( 2G ) digital cellular networks used by mobile devices such as mobile phones and tablets . It was first deployed in Finland in December 1991 . By the mid-2010s , it became a global standard for mobile communications achieving over 90% market share , and operating in over 193 countries and territories . 2G networks developed as a replacement for first generation ( 1G ) analog cellular networks . The GSM standard originally described a digital , circuit-switched network optimized for full duplex voice telephony . This expanded over time to include data communications , first by circuit-switched transport , then by packet data transport via General Packet Radio Service ( GPRS ) , and Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution ( EDGE ) . Subsequently , the 3GPP developed third-generation ( 3G ) UMTS standards , followed by fourth-generation ( 4G ) LTE Advanced standards , which do not form part of the ETSI GSM standard . GSM is a trade mark owned by the GSM Association . It may also refer to the ( initially ) most common voice codec used , Full Rate .",

  "/wiki/CDMA": "Code-division multiple access ( CDMA ) is a channel access method used by various radio communication technologies . CDMA is an example of multiple access , where several transmitters can send information simultaneously over a single communication channel . This allows several users to share a band of frequencies ( see bandwidth ) . To permit this without undue interference between the users , CDMA employs spread spectrum technology and a special coding scheme ( where each transmitter is assigned a code ) . CDMA is used as the access method in many mobile phone standards . IS-95 , also called cdmaOne , and its 3G evolution CDMA2000 , are often simply referred to as CDMA , but UMTS , the 3G standard used by GSM carriers , also uses wideband CDMA , or W-CDMA , as well as TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA , as its radio technologies .",

The first phone was released in September 2006 . As a clamshell/flip phone , the Krzr is longer but narrower than the Motorola Razr .",

  "/wiki/W-CDMA": "The Universal Mobile Telecommunications System ( UMTS ) is a third generation mobile cellular system for networks based on the GSM standard . Developed and maintained by the 3GPP ( 3rd Generation Partnership Project ) , UMTS is a component of the International Telecommunications Union IMT-2000 standard set and compares with the CDMA2000 standard set for networks based on the competing cdmaOne technology . UMTS uses wideband code division multiple access ( W-CDMA ) radio access technology to offer greater spectral efficiency and bandwidth to mobile network operators . UMTS specifies a complete network system , which includes the radio access network ( UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network , or UTRAN ) , the core network ( Mobile Application Part , or MAP ) and the authentication of users via SIM ( subscriber identity module ) cards . The technology described in UMTS is sometimes also referred to as Freedom of Mobile Multimedia Access ( FOMA ) or 3GSM . Unlike EDGE ( IMT Single-Carrier , based on GSM ) and CDMA2000 ( IMT Multi-Carrier ) , UMTS requires new base stations and new frequency allocations .",
  "/wiki/Motorola_Hint_QA30": "Motorola Hint QA30 is a sliding mobile camera phone introduced by Motorola in the fourth quarter of 2008 . It was available on Alltel , Bell Canada , Cricket , MetroPCS , and US Cellular . It is no longer supported by carriers due to relying on the outdated CDMA . About the size of a post-it note , the QA30 slides open to reveal a full QWERTY keyboard for text messaging and email . The 2 megapixel camera stores 1600x1200 resolution pictures on either the 128 MB internal memory or on a MicroSD card up to 8 GB .",

  "/wiki/Motorola_RAZR_V3": "The Motorola Razr ( styled RAZR , pronounced /\u02c8re\u026az\u0259/ like razor ; sometimes also Siliqua ) was a series of mobile phones by Motorola , part of the 4LTR line . The V3 was the first phone released in the series and was introduced in July 2004 and released in the market in the third quarter of 2004 . The V3 model was followed soon thereafter by the much improved V3i with a collaboration with Apple Inc. for iTunes to be built-in . Because of its striking appearance and thin profile , it was initially marketed as an exclusive fashion phone . But , within a year , its price was lowered and as a result it sold over 50 million units by July 2006 . Leading up to the release , Motorola 's Cell phone division sales were stagnant and losing money . This success made the division profitable again . Over the Razr 's four-year run , the V3 model sold more than 130 million units , becoming the best-selling clamshell phone in the world to date . The Razr series was marketed until July 2007 , when the succeeding Motorola Razr2 series was released . The succeeding models were the V8 , the V9 , and the V9m . However , Razr2 sales were not as good as the original , with consumers moving to competing products . Because Motorola relied so long upon the Razr and its derivatives and was slow to develop new products in the growing market for feature-rich touchscreen and 3G phones , the Razr appeal declined , leading Motorola to eventually drop behind Samsung and LG in market share for mobile phones .",
