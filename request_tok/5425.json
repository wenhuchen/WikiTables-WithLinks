Roda JC is known as the coal-miner 's club ; fans of archrival club MVV , from the provincial capital of Maastricht , say those words condescendingly . However , in Kerkrade and the surrounding area , they are said with pride and respect . The last Dutch coal mines were closed in the 1970s , but the southeastern part of the Netherlands ' most southern province , Limburg , is still referred to as the Mijnstreek ( mine district ) today . The coal mines are still recalled in folk songs in the regional dialect and in the stories of old miners , reminiscing about an era that will never return . Southern Limburg will always be their home . Their team , in most cases , is Roda JC . Roda JC 's club honours include seven European campaigns and six KNVB Cup finals , of which they won two .",
