  "/wiki/Blackpool_Tower": "Blackpool Tower is a tourist attraction in Blackpool , Lancashire , England , which was opened to the public on 14 May 1894 . When completed Blackpool Tower was the tallest man made structure in the British Empire . Inspired by the Eiffel Tower in Paris , it is 518 feet ( 158 metres ) tall and is the 120th-tallest freestanding tower in the world . Blackpool Tower is also the common name for the Tower Buildings , an entertainment complex in a red-brick three-storey block that comprises the tower , Tower Circus , the Tower Ballroom , and roof gardens , which was designated a Grade I listed building in 1973 .

  "/wiki/Eiffel_Tower": "The Eiffel Tower ( /\u02c8a\u026af\u0259l/ EYE-f\u0259l ; French : tour Eiffel [ tu\u0281\u203f\u025bf\u025bl ] ( listen ) ) is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris , France . It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel , whose company designed and built the tower . Constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World 's Fair , it was initially criticised by some of France 's leading artists and intellectuals for its design , but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world . The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world ; 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015 . The tower is 324 metres ( 1,063 ft ) tall , about the same height as an 81-storey building , and the tallest structure in Paris . Its base is square , measuring 125 metres ( 410 ft ) on each side . During its construction , the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world , a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930 . It was the first structure to reach a height of 300 metres . Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957 , it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres ( 17 ft ) . Excluding transmitters , the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct . The tower has three levels for visitors , with restaurants on the first and second levels . The top level 's upper platform is 276 m ( 906 ft ) above the ground - the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union .",

  "/wiki/Frank_Matcham": "Frank Matcham ( 22 November 1854 - 17 May 1920 ) was an English theatre architect and designer . During his 40-year career , he was responsible for the design and construction of over 90 theatres and the redesign and refurbishment of a further 80 throughout the United Kingdom . Matcham was best known for his work in London , under Moss Empires , which included the designs of the Hippodrome ( 1900 ) , Hackney Empire ( 1901 ) , London Coliseum ( 1903 ) , London Palladium ( 1910 ) , and the Victoria Palace ( 1911 ) . According to the dramatist Alan Bennett , there was a Matcham theatre in every corner of the UK . Matcham was born in Newton Abbot , Devon , where he became apprenticed at the age of 14 to the architect George Soudon Bridgman . Matcham moved to London , aged 21 , where he joined the architectural practice of J. T. Robinson , who was to become his father-in-law . Under Robinson , Matcham completed his first solo design , the Elephant and Castle Theatre , which opened in June 1879 . He took over Robinson 's business on the latter 's death and continued the designs of various provincial theatres . Matcham formed his own practice , Matcham & Co. , in the 1880s and enlisted skilled craftsman . His first major association came in the 1880s when he was employed to design and refurbish theatres belonging to the Revill family who owned many of the theatres throughout the UK at that time . Matcham 's most successful period was between 1892 and 1912 when he worked extensively for Moss Empires , a theatrical company headed by Edward Moss and run by Oswald Stoll . Under them , he completed 21 theatres , most of which were in the provinces .",

  "/wiki/Copper": "Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu ( from Latin : cuprum ) and atomic number 29 . It is a soft , malleable , and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity . A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish-orange color . Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity , as a building material , and as a constituent of various metal alloys , such as sterling silver used in jewelry , cupronickel used to make marine hardware and coins , and constantan used in strain gauges and thermocouples for temperature measurement . Copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form ( native metals ) . This led to very early human use in several regions , from c. 8000 BC . Thousands of years later , it was the first metal to be smelted from sulfide ores , c. 5000 BC , the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold , c. 4000 BC and the first metal to be purposefully alloyed with another metal , tin , to create bronze , c. 3500 BC . In the Roman era , copper was principally mined on Cyprus , the origin of the name of the metal , from aes \u0441yprium ( metal of Cyprus ) , later corrupted to \u0441uprum ( Latin ) , whence coper ( Old English ) and copper , first used around 1530 . Commonly encountered compounds are copper ( II ) salts , which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite , malachite , and turquoise , and have been used widely and historically as pigments . Copper used in buildings , usually for roofing , oxidizes to form a green verdigris ( or patina ) . Copper is sometimes used in decorative art , both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments .

The concept of the fourth wall of the theatre stage space that faces the audience is essentially the same . It can be considered as a social construct which divides the actors and their stage-world from the audience which has come to witness it . But since the curtain usually comes down just behind the proscenium arch , it has a physical reality when the curtain is down , hiding the stage from view . The same plane also includes the drop , in traditional theatres of modern times , from the stage level to the stalls level of the audience , which was the original meaning of the proscaenium in Roman theatres , where this mini-facade was given more architectural emphasis than is the case in modern theatres . A proscenium stage is structurally different from a thrust stage or an arena stage , as explained below .",

As the world 's oldest and largest continuously functioning international institution , it has played a prominent role in the history and development of Western civilisation . The church is headed by the Bishop of Rome , known as the pope . Its central administration is the Holy See . The Christian beliefs of Catholicism are found in the Nicene Creed . The Catholic Church teaches that it is the One , Holy , Catholic and Apostolic church founded by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission , [ note 1 ] that its bishops are the successors of Christ 's apostles , and that the pope is the successor to Saint Peter upon whom primacy was conferred by Jesus Christ . It maintains that it practises the original Christian faith , reserving infallibility , passed down by sacred tradition . The Latin Church , the twenty-three Eastern Catholic Churches , and institutes such as mendicant orders , enclosed monastic orders and third orders reflect a variety of theological and spiritual emphases in the church . Of its seven sacraments the Eucharist is the principal one , celebrated liturgically in the Mass . The church teaches that through consecration by a priest the sacrificial bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ . The Virgin Mary is venerated in the Catholic Church as Mother of God and Queen of Heaven , honoured in dogmas and devotions . Its teaching includes Divine Mercy , sanctification through faith and evangelisation of the Gospel as well as Catholic social teaching , which emphasises voluntary support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the corporal and spiritual works of mercy .",

  "/wiki/Buttress": "A buttress is an architectural structure built against or projecting from a wall which serves to support or reinforce the wall . Buttresses are fairly common on more ancient buildings , as a means of providing support to act against the lateral ( sideways ) forces arising out of the roof structures that lack adequate bracing . The term counterfort can be synonymous with buttress , and is often used when referring to dams , retaining walls and other structures holding back earth . Early examples of buttresses are found on the Eanna Temple ( ancient Uruk ) , dating to as early as the 4th millennium BCE . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/Battlement": "A battlement in defensive architecture , such as that of city walls or castles , comprises a parapet ( i.e. , a defensive low wall between chest-height and head-height ) , in which gaps or indentations , which are often rectangular , occur at intervals to allow for the launch of arrows or other projectiles from within the defences . These gaps are termed crenels ( also known as carnels , or embrasures ) , and a wall or building with them is called crenellated ; alternative ( older ) terms are castellated and embattled . The act of adding crenels to a previously unbroken parapet is termed crenellation . The function of battlements in war is to protect the defenders by giving them something to hide behind , from which they can pop out to launch their own missiles . A defensive building might be designed and built with battlements , or a manor house might be fortified by adding battlements , where no parapet previously existed , or cutting crenellations into its existing parapet wall . A distinctive feature of late medieval English church architecture is to crenellate the tops of church towers , and often the tops of lower walls . These are essentially decorative rather than functional , as are many examples on secular buildings . The solid widths between the crenels are called merlons . Battlements on walls have protected walkways ( chemin de ronde ) behind them . On tower or building tops , the ( often flat ) roof is used as the protected fighting platform .",
  "/wiki/Coping_(architecture)": "Coping ( from cope , Latin capa ) consists of the capping or covering of a wall . A splayed or wedge coping slopes in a single direction ; a saddle coping slopes to either side of a central high point . A coping may consist of stone ( capstone ) , brick , clay or terracotta , concrete or cast stone , tile , slate , wood , thatch , or various metals , including aluminum , copper , stainless steel , steel , and zinc . In all cases it should be weathered ( have a slanted or curved top surface ) to throw off the water . Various types of copings exist . A diagrammatic explanation of copper copings is available . In Romanesque work copings appeared plain and flat , and projected over the wall with a throating to form a drip . In later work a steep slope was given to the weathering ( mainly on the outer side ) , and began at the top with an astragal ; in the Decorated Gothic style there were two or three sets off ; and in the later Perpendicular Gothic these assumed a wavy section , and the coping mouldings continued round the sides , as well as at top and bottom , mitring at the angles , as in many of the colleges at Oxford .",

  "/wiki/Crossing_(architecture)": "A crossing , in ecclesiastical architecture , is the junction of the four arms of a cruciform ( cross-shaped ) church . In a typically oriented church ( especially of Romanesque and Gothic styles ) , the crossing gives access to the nave on the west , the transept arms on the north and south , and the choir , as the first part of the chancel , on the east . The crossing is sometimes surmounted by a tower or dome . A large crossing tower is particularly common on English Gothic cathedrals . With the Renaissance , building a dome above the crossing became popular . Because the crossing is open on four sides , the weight of the tower or dome rests heavily on the corners ; a stable construction thus required great skill on the part of the builders . In centuries past , it was not uncommon for overambitious crossing towers to collapse . Sacrist Alan of Walsingham 's octagon , built between 1322 and 1328 after the collapse of Ely 's nave crossing on 22 February 1322 , is the . greatest individual achievement of architectural genius at Ely Cathedral according to architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner . A tower over the crossing may be called a lantern tower if it has openings through which light from outside can shine down to the crossing . In Early Medieval churches , the crossing square was often used as a module , or a unit of measurement . The nave and transept would have lengths that were a certain multiple of the length of the crossing square .",

The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire .

Similar apparitions of the Lady were reported on eighteen occasions that year , until the climax revelation of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception took place . In 18 January 1862 , the local Bishop of Tarbes Bertrand-S\u00e9v\u00e8re Laurence endorsed the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Lourdes . On 3 July 1876 , Pope Pius IX officially granted a Canonical Coronation to the image that used to be in the courtyard of what is now part of the Rosary Basilica . The image of Our Lady of Lourdes has been widely copied and reproduced in shrines and homes , often in garden landscapes . Soubirous was later canonized as a Catholic saint by Pope Pius XI in 1933 .

Halakha holds that communal Jewish worship can be carried out wherever ten Jews ( a minyan ) assemble . Worship can also be carried out alone or with fewer than ten people assembled together . However , halakha considers certain prayers as communal prayers and therefore they may be recited only by a minyan . In terms of its specific ritual and liturgical functions , the synagogue does not replace the long-since destroyed Temple in Jerusalem .

  "/wiki/Ashlar": "Ashlar ( /\u02c8\u00e6\u0283l\u0259r/ ) is finely dressed ( cut , worked ) stone , either an individual stone that was worked until squared or the structure built from it . Ashlar is the finest stone masonry unit , generally rectangular cuboid , mentioned by Vitruvius as opus isodomum , or less frequently trapezoidal . Precisely cut on all faces adjacent to those of other stones , ashlar is capable of very thin joints between blocks , and the visible face of the stone may be quarry-faced or feature a variety of treatments : tooled , smoothly polished or rendered with another material for decorative effect . One such decorative treatment consists of small grooves achieved by the application of a metal comb . Generally used only on softer stone ashlar , this decoration is known as mason 's drag . Ashlar is in contrast to rubble masonry , which employs irregularly shaped stones , sometimes minimally worked or selected for similar size , or both . Ashlar is related but distinct from other stone masonry that is finely dressed but not quadrilateral , such as curvilinear and polygonal masonry . Ashlar may be coursed , which involves lengthy horizontals layers of stone blocks laid in parallel , and therefore with continuous horizontal joints . Ashlar may also be random , which involves stone blocks laid with deliberately discontinuous courses and therefore discontinuous joints both vertically and horizontally . In either case , it generally uses a joining material such as mortar to bind the blocks together , although dry ashlar construction , metal ties , and other methods of assembly have been used . The dry ashlar of Inca architecture in Cusco and Machu Picchu is particularly fine and famous .",
  "/wiki/Roof_tile": "Roof tiles are designed mainly to keep out rain , and are traditionally made from locally available materials such as terracotta or slate . Modern materials such as concrete and plastic are also used and some clay tiles have a waterproof glaze . Roof tiles are 'hung ' from the framework of a roof by fixing them with nails . The tiles are usually hung in parallel rows , with each row overlapping the row below it to exclude rainwater and to cover the nails that hold the row below . There are also roof tiles for special positions , particularly where the planes of the several pitches meet . They include ridge , hip and valley tiles . These can either be bedded and pointed in cement mortar or mechanically fixed . Similarly to roof tiling , tiling has been used to provide a protective weather envelope to the sides of timber frame buildings . These are hung on laths nailed to wall timbers , with tiles specially molded to cover corners and jambs . Often these tiles are shaped at the exposed end to give a decorative effect . Another form of this is the so-called mathematical tile , which was hung on laths , nailed and then grouted . This form of tiling gives an imitation of brickwork and was developed to give the appearance of brick , but avoided the brick taxes of the 18th century .",

The Byzantine era is usually dated from 330 CE , when Constantine the Great moved the Roman capital to Byzantium , which became Constantinople , until the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453 . However , there was initially no hard line between the Byzantine and Roman empires , and early Byzantine architecture is stylistically and structurally indistinguishable from earlier Roman architecture . This terminology was introduced by modern historians to designate the medieval Roman Empire as it evolved as a distinct artistic and cultural entity centered on the new capital of Constantinople ( modern-day Istanbul ) rather than the city of Rome and its environs . Its architecture dramatically influenced the later medieval architecture throughout Europe and the Near East , and became the primary progenitor of the Renaissance and Ottoman architectural traditions that followed its collapse .",
  "/wiki/Torah": "Torah can most specifically mean the first five books ( Pentateuch or five books of Moses ) of the Hebrew Bible or Tanakh . It can also mean the continued narrative from all 24 books of the Hebrew Bible , and it can even mean the totality of Jewish teaching , culture , and practice , whether derived from biblical texts or later rabbinic writings . If in bound book form , it is usually printed with the rabbinic commentaries ( perushim ) . If meant for liturgic purposes , it takes the form of a Torah scroll ( sefer Torah ) , which contains strictly the five books of Moses . In rabbinic literature the word Torah denotes both the five books ( Hebrew : \u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d1\u05db\u05ea\u05d1 Torah that is written ) and the Oral Torah ( \u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d1\u05e2\u05dc \u05e4\u05d4 , Torah that is spoken ) . The Oral Torah consists of interpretations and amplifications which according to rabbinic tradition have been handed down from generation to generation and are now embodied in the Talmud and Midrash . Rabbinic tradition 's understanding is that all of the teachings found in the Torah ( both written and oral ) were given by God through the prophet Moses , some at Mount Sinai and others at the Tabernacle , and all the teachings were written down by Moses , which resulted in the Torah that exists today . According to the Midrash , the Torah was created prior to the creation of the world , and was used as the blueprint for Creation . The majority of Biblical scholars believe that the written books were a product of the Babylonian captivity ( c. 6th century BCE ) , based on earlier written sources and oral traditions , and that it was completed with final revisions during the post-Exilic period ( c. 5th century BCE ) . Traditionally , the words of the Torah are written on a scroll by a scribe ( sofer ) in Hebrew . A Torah portion is read publicly at least once every three days in the presence of a congregation . Reading the Torah publicly is one of the bases of Jewish communal life .",
  "/wiki/Israelites": "The Israelites ( /\u02c8\u026azri\u0259la\u026ats/ ; Hebrew : \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc Bnei Yisra'el ) were a confederation of Iron Age Semitic-speaking tribes of the ancient Near East , who inhabited a part of Canaan during the tribal and monarchic periods . According to the religious narrative of the Hebrew Bible , the Israelites ' origin is traced back to the Biblical patriarchs and matriarchs Abraham and his wife Sarah , through their son Isaac and his wife Rebecca , and their son Jacob who was later called Israel , whence they derive their name , with his wives Leah and Rachel and the handmaids Zilpa and Bilhah . Modern archaeology has largely shown that determining the historicity of the religious narrative is impossible , with many scholars viewing the stories as inspiring national myth narratives with little historical value . Based on the archaeological evidence , according to the modern archaeological account , the Israelites and their culture did not overtake the region by force , but instead branched out of the indigenous Canaanite peoples that long inhabited the Southern Levant , Syria , ancient Israel , and the Transjordan region through a gradual evolution of a distinct monolatristic - later cementing as monotheistic - religion centered on Yahweh . The outgrowth of Yahweh-centric monolatrism from Canaanite polytheism started with Yahwism , the belief in the existence of the many gods and goddesses of the Canaanite pantheon but with the consistent worship of only Yahweh . Along with a number of cultic practices , this gave rise to a separate Israelite ethnic group identity . The final transition of their Yahweh-based religion to monotheism and rejection of the existence of the other Canaanite gods set the Israelites apart from their fellow Canaanite brethren . The Israelites , however , continued to retain various cultural commonalities with other Canaanites , including use of one of the Canaanite dialects , Hebrew , which is today the only living descendant of that language group . In the Hebrew Bible the term Israelites is used interchangeably with the term Twelve Tribes of Israel . Although related , the terms Hebrews , Israelites , and Jews are not interchangeable in all instances . Israelites ( Yisraelim ) refers to the people that the Hebrew Bible describes specifically as the direct descendants of any of the sons of the patriarch Jacob ( later called Israel ) , and his descendants as a people are also collectively called Israel , including converts to their faith in worship of the god of Israel , Yahweh . Hebrews ( \u02bfIvrim ) , on the contrary , is used to denote the Israelites ' immediate forebears who dwelt in the land of Canaan , the Israelites themselves , and the Israelites ' ancient and modern descendants ( including Jews and Samaritans ) .",
  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",

The invention of a white pottery glaze suitable for painted decoration , by the addition of an oxide of tin to the slip of a lead glaze , was a major advance in the history of pottery . The invention seems to have been made in Iran or the Middle East before the ninth century . A kiln capable of producing temperatures exceeding 1,000 \u00b0C ( 1,830 \u00b0F ) was required to achieve this result , the result of millennia of refined pottery-making traditions . The term is now used for a wide variety of pottery from several parts of the world , including many types of European painted wares , often produced as cheaper versions of porcelain styles . English generally uses various other terms for well-known sub-types of faience . Italian tin-glazed earthenware , at least the early forms , is called maiolica in English , Dutch wares are called Delftware , and their English equivalents English delftware , leaving faience as the normal term in English for French , German , Spanish , Portuguese wares and those of other countries not mentioned ( it is also the usual French term , and fayence in German ) . The name faience is simply the French name for Faenza , in the Romagna near Ravenna , Italy , where a painted majolica ware on a clean , opaque pure-white ground , was produced for export as early as the fifteenth century .",

  "/wiki/Frieze": "In architecture , the frieze /fri\u02d0z/ is the wide central section part of an entablature and may be plain in the Ionic or Doric order , or decorated with bas-reliefs . Paterae are also usually used to decorate friezes . Even when neither columns nor pilasters are expressed , on an astylar wall it lies upon the architrave ( main beam ) and is capped by the moldings of the cornice . A frieze can be found on many Greek and Roman buildings , the Parthenon Frieze being the most famous , and perhaps the most elaborate . This style is typical for the Persians . In interiors , the frieze of a room is the section of wall above the picture rail and under the crown moldings or cornice . By extension , a frieze is a long stretch of painted , sculpted or even calligraphic decoration in such a position , normally above eye-level . Frieze decorations may depict scenes in a sequence of discrete panels . The material of which the frieze is made of may be plasterwork , carved wood or other decorative medium . In an example of an architectural frieze on the fa\u00e7ade of a building , the octagonal Tower of the Winds in the Roman agora at Athens bears relief sculptures of the eight winds on its frieze . A pulvinated frieze ( or pulvino ) is convex in section . Such friezes were features of 17th-century Northern Mannerism , especially in subsidiary friezes , and much employed in interior architecture and in furniture .",
  "/wiki/Portico": "A portico is a porch leading to the entrance of a building , or extended as a colonnade , with a roof structure over a walkway , supported by columns or enclosed by walls . This idea was widely used in ancient Greece and has influenced many cultures , including most Western cultures . Some noteworthy examples of porticos are the East Portico of the United States Capitol , the portico adorning the Pantheon in Rome and the portico of University College London . Porticos are sometimes topped with pediments . Palladio was a pioneer of using temple-fronts for secular buildings . In the UK , the temple-front applied to The Vyne , Hampshire , was the first portico applied to an English country house . A pronaos ( UK : /pro\u028a\u02c8ne\u026a.\u0252s/ or US : /pro\u028a\u02c8ne\u026a.\u0259s/ ) is the inner area of the portico of a Greek or Roman temple , situated between the portico 's colonnade or walls and the entrance to the cella , or shrine . Roman temples commonly had an open pronaos , usually with only columns and no walls , and the pronaos could be as long as the cella . The word pronaos is Greek for before a temple . In Latin , a pronaos is also referred to as an anticum or prodomus .",
  "/wiki/Ionic_order": "The Ionic order forms one of the three classical orders of classical architecture , the other two canonic orders being the Doric and the Corinthian . There are two lesser orders : the Tuscan ( a plainer Doric ) , and the rich variant of Corinthian called the composite order , both added by 16th-century Italian architectural writers , based on Roman practice . Of the three canonic orders , the Ionic order has the narrowest columns . The Ionic capital is characterized by the use of volutes . The Ionic columns normally stand on a base which separates the shaft of the column from the stylobate or platform ; the cap is usually enriched with egg-and-dart . Since Vitruvius , a female character has been ascribed to the Ionic ( in contrast to the masculine Doric ) .",

  "/wiki/English_Gothic_architecture": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls .",
  "/wiki/Finial": "A finial or hip-knob is an element marking the top or end of some object , often formed to be a decorative feature . In architecture it is a decorative device , typically carved in stone , employed to emphasize the apex of a dome , spire , tower , roof , or gable or any of various distinctive ornaments at the top , end , or corner of a building or structure . Where there are several such elements they may be called pinnacles . Smaller finials in materials such as metal or wood are used as a decorative ornament on the tops or ends of poles or rods such as tent-poles or curtain rods or any object such as a piece of furniture . These are frequently seen on top of bed posts or clocks . Decorative finials are also commonly used to fasten lampshades , and as an ornamental element at the end of the handles of souvenir spoons . The charm at the end of a pull chain ( such as for a ceiling fan or a lamp ) is also known as a finial . During the various dynasties in China , a finial was worn on the top of the hats civil or military officials wore during formal court ceremonies . The finial was changed to a knob for other daily usage ( including semi-formal ceremonies ) . The Pickelhaube is a Central European military helmet with a finial topped by a spike .",
  "/wiki/Nave": "The nave /ne\u026av/ is the central part of a church , stretching from the ( normally western ) main entrance or rear wall , to the transepts , or in a church without transepts , to the chancel . When a church contains side aisles , as in a basilica-type building , the strict definition of the term nave is restricted to the central aisle . In a broader , more colloquial sense , the nave includes all areas available for the lay worshippers , including the side-aisles and transepts . Either way , the nave is distinct from the area reserved for the choir and clergy .",
  "/wiki/Transept": "A transept ( with two semitransepts ) is a transverse part of any building , which lies across the main body of the edifice . In churches , a transept is an area set crosswise to the nave in a cruciform ( cross-shaped ) building within the Romanesque and Gothic Christian church architectural traditions . Each half of a transept is known as a semitransept .",
  "/wiki/Apse": "In architecture , an apse ( plural apses ; from Latin absis : arch , vault from Greek \u1f00\u03c8\u03af\u03c2 apsis arch ; sometimes written apsis , plural apsides ) is a semicircular recess covered with a hemispherical vault or semi-dome , also known as an exedra . In Byzantine , Romanesque , and Gothic Christian church ( including cathedral and abbey ) architecture , the term is applied to a semi-circular or polygonal termination of the main building at the liturgical east end ( where the altar is ) , regardless of the shape of the roof , which may be flat , sloping , domed , or hemispherical . Smaller apses may also be in other locations , especially shrines .",
  "/wiki/Chancel": "In church architecture , the chancel is the space around the altar , including the choir and the sanctuary ( sometimes called the presbytery ) , at the liturgical east end of a traditional Christian church building . It may terminate in an apse . It is generally the area used by the clergy and choir during worship , while the congregation is in the nave . Direct access may be provided by a priest 's door , usually on the south side of the church . This is one definition , sometimes called the strict one ; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels , these are also often counted as part of the chancel , especially when discussing architecture . In smaller churches , where the altar is backed by the outside east wall and there is no distinct choir , the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area . In churches with a retroquire area behind the altar , this may only be included in the broader definition of chancel . In a cathedral or other large church , there may be a distinct choir area at the start of the chancel ( looking from the nave ) , before reaching the sanctuary , and an ambulatory may run beside and behind it . All these may be included in the chancel , at least in architectural terms ( see above ) . In many churches , the altar has now been moved to the front of the chancel , in what was built as the choir area , or to the centre of the transept , somewhat confusing the distinction between chancel , choir and sanctuary . In churches with less traditional plans , the term may not be useful in either architectural or ecclesiastical terms . The chancel may be a step or two higher than the level of the nave , and the sanctuary is often raised still further .",
  "/wiki/Anglicanism": "Anglicanism is a Western Christian tradition which has developed from the practices , liturgy , and identity of the Church of England following the English Reformation . Adherents of Anglicanism are called Anglicans , or Episcopalians in some countries . The majority of Anglicans are members of national or regional ecclesiastical provinces of the international Anglican Communion , which forms the third-largest Christian communion in the world , after the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church . They are in full communion with the See of Canterbury , and thus the Archbishop of Canterbury , whom the communion refers to as its primus inter pares ( Latin , first among equals ) . He calls the decennial Lambeth Conference , chairs the meeting of primates , and is the president of the Anglican Consultative Council . Some churches that are not part of the Anglican Communion or recognised by the Anglican Communion also call themselves Anglican , including those that are part of the Continuing Anglican movement and Anglican realignment . Anglicans base their Christian faith on the Bible , traditions of the apostolic Church , apostolic succession ( historic episcopate ) , and the writings of the Church Fathers . Anglicanism forms one of the branches of Western Christianity , having definitively declared its independence from the Holy See at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement . Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Protestantism . These reforms in the Church of England were understood by one of those most responsible for them , Thomas Cranmer , the Archbishop of Canterbury , and others as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions , namely Lutheranism and Calvinism . In the first half of the 17th century , the Church of England and its associated Church of Ireland were presented by some Anglican divines as comprising a distinct Christian tradition , with theologies , structures , and forms of worship representing a different kind of middle way , or via media , between Protestantism and Catholicism - a perspective that came to be highly influential in later theories of Anglican identity and expressed in the description of Anglicanism as Catholic and Reformed . The degree of distinction between Protestant and Catholic tendencies within the Anglican tradition is routinely a matter of debate both within specific Anglican churches and throughout the Anglican Communion .",

  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",

  "/wiki/Art_Deco": "Art Deco , sometimes referred to as Deco , is a style of visual arts , architecture and design that first appeared in France just before World War I . Art Deco influenced the design of buildings , furniture , jewelry , fashion , cars , movie theatres , trains , ocean liners , and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners . It took its name , short for Arts D\u00e9coratifs , from the Exposition internationale des arts d\u00e9coratifs et industriels modernes ( International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts ) held in Paris in 1925 . It combined modern styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials . During its heyday , Art Deco represented luxury , glamour , exuberance , and faith in social and technological progress . Art Deco was a pastiche of many different styles , sometimes contradictory , united by a desire to be modern . From its outset , Art Deco was influenced by the bold geometric forms of Cubism and the Vienna Secession ; the bright colors of Fauvism and of the Ballets Russes ; the updated craftsmanship of the furniture of the eras of Louis Philippe I and Louis XVI ; and the exotic styles of China and Japan , India , Persia , ancient Egypt and Maya art . It featured rare and expensive materials , such as ebony and ivory , and exquisite craftsmanship . The Chrysler Building and other skyscrapers of New York built during the 1920s and 1930s are monuments of the Art Deco style . In the 1930s , during the Great Depression , Art Deco became more subdued . New materials arrived , including chrome plating , stainless steel , and plastic . A sleeker form of the style , called Streamline Moderne , appeared in the 1930s ; it featured curving forms and smooth , polished surfaces .",
  "/wiki/Burlesque": "A burlesque is a literary , dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works , or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects . The word derives from the Italian burlesco , which , in turn , is derived from the Italian burla - a joke , ridicule or mockery . Burlesque overlaps in meaning with caricature , parody and travesty , and , in its theatrical sense , with extravaganza , as presented during the Victorian era . Burlesque has been used in English in this literary and theatrical sense since the late 17th century . It has been applied retrospectively to works of Chaucer and Shakespeare and to the Graeco-Roman classics . Contrasting examples of literary burlesque are Alexander Pope 's The Rape of the Lock and Samuel Butler 's Hudibras . An example of musical burlesque is Richard Strauss 's 1890 Burleske for piano and orchestra . Examples of theatrical burlesques include W. S. Gilbert 's Robert the Devil and the A. C. Torr - Meyer Lutz shows , including Ruy Blas and the Blas\u00e9 Rou\u00e9 . A later use of the term , particularly in the United States , refers to performances in a variety show format . These were popular from the 1860s to the 1940s , often in cabarets and clubs , as well as theatres , and featured bawdy comedy and female striptease . Some Hollywood films attempted to recreate the spirit of these performances from the 1930s to the 1960s , or included burlesque-style scenes within dramatic films , such as 1972 's Cabaret and 1979 's All That Jazz , among others .

  "/wiki/Slate": "Slate is a fine-grained , foliated , homogeneous metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade regional metamorphism . It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock . Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering , but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression . The foliation in slate is called slaty cleavage . It is caused by strong compression causing fine grained clay flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression . When expertly cut by striking parallel to the foliation , with a specialized tool in the quarry , many slates will display a property called fissility , forming smooth flat sheets of stone which have long been used for roofing , floor tiles , and other purposes . Slate is frequently grey in color , especially when seen , en masse , covering roofs . However , slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality ; for example , slate from North Wales can be found in many shades of grey , from pale to dark , and may also be purple , green or cyan . Slate is not to be confused with shale , from which it may be formed , or schist . The word slate is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock . It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate , or a writing slate . They were traditionally a small , smooth piece of the rock , often framed in wood , used with chalk as a notepad or notice board , and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns .",
  "/wiki/Hip_roof": "A hip roof , hip-roof or hipped roof , is a type of roof where all sides slope downwards to the walls , usually with a fairly gentle slope ( although a tented roof by definition is a hipped roof with steeply pitched slopes rising to a peak ) . Thus , a hipped roof house has no gables or other vertical sides to the roof . A square hip roof is shaped like a pyramid . Hip roofs on houses could have two triangular sides and two trapezoidal ones . A hip roof on a rectangular plan has four faces . They are almost always at the same pitch or slope , which makes them symmetrical about the centerlines . Hip roofs often have a consistent level fascia , meaning that a gutter can be fitted all around . Hip roofs often have dormer slanted sides .",
  "/wiki/Renaissance_architecture": "Renaissance architecture is the European architecture of the period between the early 14th and early 16th centuries in different regions , demonstrating a conscious revival and development of certain elements of ancient Greek and Roman thought and material culture . Stylistically , Renaissance architecture followed Gothic architecture and was succeeded by Baroque architecture . Developed first in Florence , with Filippo Brunelleschi as one of its innovators , the Renaissance style quickly spread to other Italian cities . The style was carried to France , Germany , England , Russia and other parts of Europe at different dates and with varying degrees of impact . Renaissance style places emphasis on symmetry , proportion , geometry and the regularity of parts , as they are demonstrated in the architecture of classical antiquity and in particular ancient Roman architecture , of which many examples remained . Orderly arrangements of columns , pilasters and lintels , as well as the use of semicircular arches , hemispherical domes , niches and aedicula replaced the more complex proportional systems and irregular profiles of medieval buildings .",
  "/wiki/Atlas_(architecture)": "In European architectural sculpture , an atlas ( also known as an atlant , or atlante or atlantid ; plural atlantes ) is a support sculpted in the form of a man , which may take the place of a column , a pier or a pilaster . The Roman term for such a sculptural support is a telamon ( plural telamones or telamons ) . The term atlantes is the Greek plural of the name Atlas - the Titan who was forced to hold the sky on his shoulders for eternity . The alternative term , telamones , also is derived from a later mythological hero , Telamon , one of the Argonauts , who was the father of Ajax . The caryatid is the female precursor of this architectural form in Greece , a woman standing in the place of each column or pillar . Caryatids are found at the treasuries at Delphi and the Erechtheion on the Acropolis at Athens for Athene . They usually are in an Ionic context and represented a ritual association with the goddesses worshiped within . The Atalante is typically life-size or larger ; smaller similar figures in the decorative arts are called terms . The body of many Atalantes turns into a rectangular pillar or other architectural feature around the waist level , a feature borrowed from the term . The pose and expression of Atalantes very often show their effort to bear the heavy load of the building , which is rarely the case with terms and caryatids . The herma or herm is a classical boundary marker or wayside monument to a god which is usually a square pillar with only a carved head on top , about life-size , and male genitals at the appropriate mid-point . Figures that are rightly called Atalantes may sometimes be described as herms .",

It consists of a flat surface raised from the main wall surface , usually treated as though it were a column , with a capital at the top , plinth ( base ) at the bottom , and the various other column elements . In contrast to a pilaster , an engaged column or buttress can support the structure of a wall and roof above . In human anatomy , a pilaster is a ridge that extends vertically across the femur , which is unique to modern humans . Its structural function is unclear .",

  "/wiki/French_Renaissance_architecture": "French Renaissance architecture is a style which was prominent between the 15th and early 17th centuries in the Kingdom of France . It succeeded French Gothic architecture . The style was originally imported from Italy next after the Hundred Years ' War by the French kings Charles VII , Louis XI , Charles VIII , Louis XII , and Fran\u00e7ois I . Several notable royal ch\u00e2teaux in this style were built in the Loire Valley , notably the Chateau de Montsoreau , the Chateau de Langeais , the Chateau d'Amboise , the Chateau of Blois , the Chateau of Gaillon , and the Chateau of Chambord , and , closer to Paris , the Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau . This style of French architecture had two distinct periods . During the first period , between about 1450 and 1590 , the Italian style was copied directly , often by Italian architects and craftsmen . In the second period , between 1540 and the end of the Valois dynasty in 1589 , French architects and craftsmen gave the style a more distinctive and original French character . The major architects of the style included the royal architects Philibert Delorme , Pierre Lescot and Jean Bullant , and the Italian architect and architectural theorist Sebastiano Serlio .",

  "/wiki/Barrel_vault": "A barrel vault , also known as a tunnel vault or a wagon vault , is an architectural element formed by the extrusion of a single curve ( or pair of curves , in the case of a pointed barrel vault ) along a given distance . The curves are typically circular in shape , lending a semi-cylindrical appearance to the total design . The barrel vault is the simplest form of a vault : effectively a series of arches placed side by side ( i.e. , one after another ) . It is a form of barrel roof . As with all arch-based constructions , there is an outward thrust generated against the walls underneath a barrel vault . There are several mechanisms for absorbing this thrust . One is to make the walls exceedingly thick and strong - this is a primitive and sometimes unacceptable method . A more elegant method is to build two or more vaults parallel to each other ; the forces of their outward thrusts will thus negate each other . This method was most often used in construction of churches , where several vaulted naves ran parallel down the length of the building . However , the outer walls of the outermost vault would still have to be quite strong or reinforced by buttressing . The third and most elegant mechanism to resist the lateral thrust was to create an intersection of two barrel vaults at right angles , thus forming a groin vault . Barrel vaults are known from Ancient Egypt , and were used extensively in Roman architecture .",
  "/wiki/Facade": "A facade ( also fa\u00e7ade ; /f\u0259\u02c8s\u0251\u02d0d/ ( listen ) ) is generally one exterior side of a building , usually the front . It is a foreign loan word from the French fa\u00e7ade ( pronounced [ fasad ] ) , which means frontage or face . In architecture , the facade of a building is often the most important aspect from a design standpoint , as it sets the tone for the rest of the building . From the engineering perspective of a building , the facade is also of great importance due to its impact on energy efficiency . For historical facades , many local zoning regulations or other laws greatly restrict or even forbid their alteration .",
  "/wiki/Foyer": "A lobby is a room in a building used for entry from the outside . Sometimes referred to as a foyer , reception area or an entrance hall , it often is a large room or complex of rooms ( in a theatre , opera house , concert hall , showroom , cinema , etc . ) adjacent to the auditorium . It is a repose area for spectators and place of venues , especially used before performance and during intermissions but also as a place of celebrations or festivities after performance . Since the mid-1980s , there has been a growing trend to think of lobbies as more than just ways to get from the door to the elevator but instead as social spaces and places of commerce . Some research has even been done to develop scales to measure lobby atmosphere to improve hotel lobby design . Many office buildings , hotels and skyscrapers go to great lengths to decorate their lobbies to create the right impression and convey an image . Supertall skyscrapers can often have one or more of what is known as a sky lobby , an intermediate floor where people can change from an express elevator that stops only at the sky lobby to a local elevator which stops at every floor within a segment of the building .",
  "/wiki/Cornice": "In architecture , a cornice ( from the Italian cornice meaning ledge ) is generally any horizontal decorative molding that crowns a building or furniture element - the cornice over a door or window , for instance , or the cornice around the top edge of a pedestal or along the top of an interior wall . A simple cornice may be formed just with a crown . A projecting cornice on a building has the function of throwing rainwater free of the building 's walls . In residential building practice , this function is handled by projecting gable ends , roof eaves , and gutters . However , house eaves may also be called cornices if they are finished with decorative molding . In this sense , while most cornices are also eaves ( in that they overhang the sides of the building ) , not all eaves are usually considered cornices - eaves are primarily functional and not necessarily decorative , and a cornice has a decorative aspect to it . The projecting cornice of a building may appear to be heavy and hence in danger of falling , particularly on commercial buildings , but often it may be very light , made of pressed metal .",
  "/wiki/Bingo_(non-US)": "Bingo is a game of probability in which players mark off numbers on cards as the numbers are drawn randomly by a caller , the winner being the first person to mark off all their numbers . Bingo became increasingly popular across the UK with more purpose-built bingo halls opened every year until 2005 . Since 2005 , Bingo Halls have seen a marked decline in revenues and the closure of many halls . The number of bingo clubs in Britain has dropped from nearly 600 in 2005 to under 400 as of January , 2014 . These closures are blamed on high taxes , the smoking ban , and the rise in online gambling , amongst other things . Bingo played in the UK ( 90-ball bingo ) is not to be confused with bingo played in the US ( 75-ball bingo ) , as the tickets and the calling are slightly different . In Quebec , this game is called Kinzo . In India , it is know by the name of Tambola .",

  "/wiki/Stucco": "Stucco or render is a construction material made of aggregates , a binder , and water . Stucco is applied wet and hardens to a very dense solid . It is used as a decorative coating for walls and ceilings , and as a sculptural and artistic material in architecture . Stucco may be used to cover less visually appealing construction materials , such as metal , concrete , cinder block , or clay brick and adobe . In English , stucco usually refers to a coating for the outside of a building and plaster to a coating for interiors ; as described below , the material itself is often little different . However , other European languages , notably including Italian , do not have the same distinction ; stucco means plaster in Italian and serves for both . This has led to English-speakers sometimes using stucco for interior decorative plasterwork in relief ."
