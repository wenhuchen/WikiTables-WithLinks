  "/wiki/Cabaret_(1972_film)": "Cabaret is a 1972 American musical drama film directed by Bob Fosse , and starring Liza Minnelli , Michael York , and Joel Grey . Set in Berlin during the Weimar Republic in 1931 , under the presence of the growing Nazi Party , the film is loosely based on the 1966 Broadway musical Cabaret by Kander and Ebb , which was adapted from the novel The Berlin Stories / Goodbye to Berlin ( 1939 ) by Christopher Isherwood and the 1951 play I Am a Camera adapted from the same book . Only a few numbers from the stage score were used for the film ; Kander and Ebb wrote new ones to replace those that were discarded . In the traditional manner of musical theater , called an integrated musical , every significant character in the stage version sings to express his or her own emotion and to advance the plot . In the film version , the musical numbers are entirely diegetic . All of them take place inside the club , with one exception : Tomorrow Belongs to Me , the only song sung neither by Grey 's character of the Kit Kat Klub 's Master of Ceremonies nor by Minnelli 's character of Sally Bowles . After the box office failure of his film version of Sweet Charity in 1969 , Bob Fosse bounced back with Cabaret in 1972 , a year that made him the most honored director in the movie business . The film also brought Liza Minnelli , the daughter of Judy Garland and Vincente Minnelli , her own first chance to sing on screen , and she won the Academy Award for Best Actress . With Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor ( Joel Grey ) , Best Director ( Bob Fosse ) , Best Cinematography , Best Art Direction , Best Sound , Best Original Song Score and Adaptation , and Best Film Editing , Cabaret holds the record for most Oscars earned by a film not honored for Best Picture . It is listed as number 367 on Empires 500 greatest films of all time . Cabaret opened to glowing reviews and strong box office , eventually taking in more than $ 20 million . In addition to its eight Oscars , it won Best Picture citations from the National Board of Review and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association , and took Best Supporting Actor honors for Grey from the National Board of Review , the Hollywood Foreign Press , and the National Society of Film Critics .",
