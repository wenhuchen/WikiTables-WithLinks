  "/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Prince_Achmed": "The Adventures of Prince Achmed ( German : Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed ) is a 1926 German animated fairytale film by Lotte Reiniger . It is the oldest surviving animated feature film ; two earlier ones were made in Argentina by Quirino Cristiani , but they are considered lost . The Adventures of Prince Achmed features a silhouette animation technique Reiniger had invented which involved manipulated cutouts made from cardboard and thin sheets of lead under a camera . The technique she used for the camera is similar to Wayang shadow puppets , though hers were animated frame by frame , not manipulated in live action . The original prints featured color tinting . Several famous avant-garde animators worked on this film with Lotte Reiniger , among them Walter Ruttmann , Berthold Bartosch , and Carl Koch . The story is based on elements from the One Thousand and One Nights written by Hanna Diyab , including Aladdin and The Story of Prince Ahmed and the Fairy Per\u012b-B\u0101n\u016b .",

  "/wiki/One_Thousand_and_One_Nights": "One Thousand and One Nights ( Arabic : \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0641 \u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0629 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0629 , \u02beAlf Laylah wa-Laylah ) is a collection of Middle Eastern folk tales compiled in Arabic during the Islamic Golden Age . It is often known in English as the Arabian Nights , from the first English-language edition ( c. 1706 - 1721 ) , which rendered the title as The Arabian Nights ' Entertainment . The work was collected over many centuries by various authors , translators , and scholars across West , Central and South Asia , and North Africa . Some tales themselves trace their roots back to ancient and medieval Arabic , Persian , Indian , Greek , Jewish and Turkish folklore and literature . In particular , many tales were originally folk stories from the Abbasid and Mamluk eras , while others , especially the frame story , are most probably drawn from the Pahlavi Persian work Hez\u0101r Afs\u0101n ( Persian : \u0647\u0632\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0641\u0633\u0627\u0646 , lit . A Thousand Tales ) , which in turn relied partly on Indian elements . What is common throughout all the editions of the Nights is the initial frame story of the ruler Shahry\u0101r and his wife Scheherazade and the framing device incorporated throughout the tales themselves . The stories proceed from this original tale ; some are framed within other tales , while others are self-contained . Some editions contain only a few hundred nights , while others include 1,001 or more . The bulk of the text is in prose , although verse is occasionally used for songs and riddles and to express heightened emotion . Most of the poems are single couplets or quatrains , although some are longer . Some of the stories commonly associated with The Nights , in particular Aladdin 's Wonderful Lamp , Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves , and The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor , were not part of The Nights in its original Arabic versions but were added to the collection by Antoine Galland and other European translators .",
  "/wiki/Anya_(Anastasia)": "Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna , also known as Anya , is the fictional character from the 1997 Fox Animation Studios film of the same name , and a fictional version of Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia . She is voiced by Meg Ryan , while Liz Callaway provides her singing voice . She is the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia ( Anya ) , the youngest daughter and one of two surviving members of the Imperial family .",
  "/wiki/Anastasia_(1997_film)": "Anastasia is a 1997 American animated musical historical fantasy film produced and directed by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman in association with Fox Animation Studios , distributed by 20th Century Fox , and starring the voices of Meg Ryan , John Cusack , Kelsey Grammer , Hank Azaria , Christopher Lloyd , Bernadette Peters , Kirsten Dunst , and Angela Lansbury . The film is a loose adaptation of the legend of Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia , which claims that she escaped the execution of her family . Its basic plot centers around an eighteen-year-old amnesiac orphan named Anya who , in hopes of finding some trace of her family , sides with con men who wish to take advantage of her likeness to the Grand Duchess ; thus the film shares its plot with Fox 's prior film from 1956 , which , in turn , was based on the 1955 play of the same name by Marcelle Maurette . Though it enjoyed a positive reception from many critics , the film was met with criticism by some historians for its fantastical retelling of the life of the Grand Duchess . From a $ 50 million budget , Anastasia grossed over $ 139 million worldwide , making it the most profitable film from Bluth and Fox Animation Studios to date . It received nominations for several awards , including for Best Original Song ( Journey to the Past ) and Best Original Musical or Comedy Score at the 70th Academy Awards . The success of Anastasia spawned various adaptations of the film into other media , including a direct-to-video spin-off film , a computer game , books , toys and a stage musical , which premiered in 2016 .",

Anastasia was the younger sister of Grand Duchesses Olga , Tatiana , and Maria , and was the elder sister of Alexei Nikolaevich , Tsarevich of Russia . She was murdered with her family by a group of Bolsheviks in Yekaterinburg on July 17 , 1918 . Persistent rumors of her possible escape circulated after her death , fueled by the fact that the location of her burial was unknown during the decades of Communist rule . The abandoned mine serving as a mass grave near Yekaterinburg which held the acidified remains of the Tsar , his wife , and three of their daughters was revealed in 1991 . These remains were put to rest at Peter and Paul Fortress in 1998 . The bodies of Alexei Nikolaevich and the remaining daughter - either Anastasia or her older sister Maria - were discovered in 2007 . Her possible survival has been conclusively disproved . Scientific analysis including DNA testing confirmed that the remains are those of the imperial family , showing that all four grand duchesses were killed in 1918 . Several women falsely claimed to have been Anastasia ; the best known impostor is Anna Anderson .",
  "/wiki/Nicholas_II_of_Russia": "Nicholas II or Nikolai II Alexandrovich Romanov [ d ] ( 18 May [ O.S . 6 May ] 1868 - 17 July 1918 ) , known in the Russian Orthodox Church as Saint Nicholas the Passion-Bearer , [ e ] was the last Tsar of Russia , ruling from 1 November 1894 until his forced abdication on 15 March 1917 . His reign saw the fall of the Russian Empire from one of the foremost great powers of the world to economic and military collapse . His memory was reviled by Soviet historians as a weak and incompetent leader whose decisions led to military defeats and the deaths of millions of his subjects . By contrast Anglo-Russian historian Nikolai Tolstoy , leader of the International Monarchist League , says , There were many bad things about the Tsar 's regime , but he inherited an autocracy and his acts are now being seen in perspective and in comparison to the terrible crimes committed by the Soviets . As Emperor , Nicholas gave limited support to the economic and political reforms promoted by top aides Sergei Witte and Pyotr Stolypin , but they faced too much aristocratic opposition to be fully effective . He supported modernization based on foreign loans and close ties with France , but resisted giving the new parliament ( the Duma ) major roles . He was criticised for the Khodynka Tragedy , antisemitic pogroms , Bloody Sunday , the violent suppression of the 1905 Russian Revolution , the repression of political opponents , and his perceived responsibility for defeat in the Russo-Japanese War ( 1904-1905 ) , which saw the annihilation of the Russian Baltic Fleet at the Battle of Tsushima , the loss of Russian influence over Manchuria and Korea , and the Japanese annexation of the north of South Sakhalin Island . Nicholas signed the Anglo-Russian Entente of 1907 , which was designed to counter Germany 's attempts to gain influence in the Middle East ; it ended the Great Game of confrontation between Russia and the British Empire . He supported Serbia and approved the mobilization of the Russian Army on 30 July 1914 . In response , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August 1914 and its ally France on 3 August 1914 , starting the First World War . The aristocracy was alarmed at the powerful influence of the despised peasant priest Grigori Rasputin over the tsar .",
  "/wiki/Russian_Tsar": "Tsar ( /z\u0251\u02d0r , s\u0251\u02d0r/ or /ts\u0251\u02d0r/ ) , also spelled csar , or tzar or czar , is a title used to designate East and South Slavic monarchs or supreme rulers of Eastern Europe , originally the Bulgarian monarchs from 10th century onwards , much later a title for two rulers of the Serbian State , and from 1547 the supreme ruler of the Tsardom of Russia and the Russian Empire . In this last capacity it lends its name to a system of government , tsarist autocracy or tsarism . The term is derived from the Latin word caesar , which was intended to mean emperor in the European medieval sense of the term - a ruler with the same rank as a Roman emperor , holding it by the approval of another emperor or a supreme ecclesiastical official ( the Pope or the Ecumenical Patriarch ) - but was usually considered by western Europeans to be equivalent to king , or to be somewhat in between a royal and imperial rank . Tsar and its variants were the official titles of the following states :",
