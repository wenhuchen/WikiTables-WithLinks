  "/wiki/Southern_United_States": "The Southern United States , also known as the American South or simply the South , is a geographic and cultural region of the United States . It is located between the Atlantic Ocean and the Western United States , with the Midwestern United States and Northeastern United States to its north and the Gulf of Mexico and Mexico to its south . The South does not fully match the geographic south of the United States but is commonly defined as including the states that fought for the Confederate States of America in the American Civil War . The Deep South is fully located in the southeastern corner . California , Arizona and New Mexico , which are geographically in the southern part of the country , are rarely considered part , while West Virginia , which separated from Virginia in 1863 , commonly is . Some scholars have proposed definitions of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries . While the states of Delaware and Maryland , as well as the District of Columbia , permitted slavery prior to and during the Civil War , they remained with the Union . Since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s , they became more culturally , economically , and politically aligned with the industrial Northern states , and are often identified as part of the Mid-Atlantic or Northeast by many residents , businesses , public institutions , and private organizations ; however , the United States Census Bureau continues to define them as in the South with regard to census regions . Usually , the South is defined as including the southeastern and south-central United States . The region is known for its culture and history , having developed its own customs , musical styles , and cuisines , which have distinguished it in some ways from the rest of the United States . The Southern ethnic heritage is diverse and includes strong European ( mostly English , Italian , Scottish , Scotch-Irish , Irish , German , French , Portuguese and Spanish American ) , African and some Native American components . Some other aspects of the historical and cultural development of the South have been influenced by the institution of slave labor on plantations in the Deep South to an extent seen nowhere else in the United States ; the presence of a large proportion of African Americans in the population ; support for the doctrine of states ' rights , and the legacy of racism magnified by the Civil War and Reconstruction Era , as seen in thousands of lynchings ( mostly from 1880 to 1930 ) , the segregated system of separate schools and public facilities known as Jim Crow laws , that lasted until the 1960s , and the widespread use of poll taxes and other methods to frequently deny black people of the right to vote or hold office until the 1960s .",

  "/wiki/Georgia_Tech_Research_Institute": "The Georgia Tech Research Institute ( GTRI ) is the nonprofit applied research arm of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta , Georgia , United States . GTRI employs around 2,400 people , and is involved in approximately $ 600 million in research annually for more than 200 clients in industry and government . Initially known as the Engineering Experiment Station , ( EES ) the organization was proposed in 1929 by W. Harry Vaughan as an analogue to the agricultural experiment stations ; the Georgia General Assembly passed a law that year creating the organization on paper , but did not allocate funds to start it . To boost the state 's struggling economy in the midst of the Great Depression , funds were found , and the station was finally established with US $ 5,000 ( equivalent to $ 80,000 in 2018 ) in April 1934 . GTRI 's research spans a variety of disciplines , including national defense , homeland security , public health , education , mobile and wireless technologies , and economic development . Major customers for GTRI research include United States Department of Defense agencies , the state of Georgia , non-defense federal agencies , and private industry . Overall , contracts and grants from Department of Defense agencies account for approximately 84% of GTRI 's total research funding . Since it was established , GTRI has expanded its engineering focus to include science , economics , policy , and other areas that leverage GTRI 's partnership with Georgia Tech . GTRI researchers are named on 76 active patents and 43 pending patents .",
  "/wiki/Lyman_Hall_(academic)": "Lyman Hall ( February 18 , 1859 - August 16 , 1905 ) was a professor and president of the Georgia School of Technology ( now called the Georgia Institute of Technology , commonly referred to as Georgia Tech ) .

Hall 's administration also introduced degrees in electrical engineering and civil engineering in December 1896 , textile engineering in February 1899 , and engineering chemistry in January 1901 . Hall died in 1905 , reportedly due to the stress of fundraising for a new chemistry building which now bears his name .",
  "/wiki/Chemical_engineering": "Chemical engineering is a branch of engineering that uses principles of chemistry , physics , mathematics , biology , and economics to efficiently use , produce , design , transport and transform energy and materials . The work of chemical engineers can range from the utilisation of nano-technology and nano-materials in the laboratory to large-scale industrial processes that convert chemicals , raw materials , living cells , microorganisms , and energy into useful forms and products . Chemical engineers are involved in many aspects of plant design and operation , including safety and hazard assessments , process design and analysis , modeling , control engineering , chemical reaction engineering , nuclear engineering , biological engineering , construction specification , and operating instructions . Chemical engineers typically hold a degree in Chemical Engineering or Process Engineering . Practising engineers may have professional certification and be accredited members of a professional body . Such bodies include the Institution of Chemical Engineers ( IChemE ) or the American Institute of Chemical Engineers ( AIChE ) . A degree in chemical engineering is directly linked with all of the other engineering disciplines , to various extents .",
