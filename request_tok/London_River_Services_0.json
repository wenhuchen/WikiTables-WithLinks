  "/wiki/Hampton_Court_Palace": "Hampton Court Palace is a royal palace in the borough of Richmond upon Thames , 12 miles ( 19.3 kilometres ) south west and upstream of central London on the River Thames . Building of the palace began in 1515 for Cardinal Thomas Wolsey , a favourite of King Henry VIII . In 1529 , as Wolsey fell from favour , the cardinal gave the palace to the King to check his disgrace ; Henry VIII later enlarged it . Along with St James ' Palace , it is one of only two surviving palaces out of the many the King owned . The palace is currently in the possession of Queen Elizabeth II and the Crown . In the following century , King William III 's massive rebuilding and expansion work , which was intended to rival the Palace of Versailles , destroyed much of the Tudor palace . His work ceased in 1694 , leaving the palace in two distinct contrasting architectural styles , domestic Tudor and Baroque . While the palace 's styles are an accident of fate , a unity exists due to the use of pink bricks and a symmetrical , if vague , balancing of successive low wings . King George II was the last monarch to reside in the palace . Today , the palace is open to the public and a major tourist attraction , easily reached by train from Waterloo station in central London and served by Hampton Court railway station in East Molesey , in Transport for London 's Zone 6 . In addition , London Buses routes 111 , 216 , 411 and R68 stop outside the palace gates . The structure and grounds are cared for by an independent charity , Historic Royal Palaces , which receives no funding from the Government or the Crown .",

  "/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster": "The Palace of Westminster serves as the meeting place for both the House of Commons and the House of Lords , the two houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom . Commonly known as the Houses of Parliament after its occupants , the Palace lies on the north bank of the River Thames in the City of Westminster , in central London , England . Its name , which derives from the neighbouring Westminster Abbey , may refer to either of two structures : the Old Palace , a medieval building-complex destroyed by fire in 1834 , or its replacement , the New Palace that stands today . The palace is owned by the monarch in right of the Crown and , for ceremonial purposes , retains its original status as a royal residence . Committees appointed by both houses manage the building and report to the Speaker of the House of Commons and to the Lord Speaker . The first royal palace constructed on the site dated from the 11th century , and Westminster became the primary residence of the Kings of England until fire destroyed much of the complex in 1512 . After that , it served as the home of the Parliament of England , which had met there since the 13th century , and also as the seat of the Royal Courts of Justice , based in and around Westminster Hall . In 1834 an even greater fire ravaged the heavily rebuilt Houses of Parliament , and the only significant medieval structures to survive were Westminster Hall , the Cloisters of St Stephen 's , the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft , and the Jewel Tower . In the subsequent competition for the reconstruction of the Palace , the architect Charles Barry won with a design for new buildings in the Gothic Revival style , specifically inspired by the English Perpendicular Gothic style of the 14th-16th centuries . The remains of the Old Palace ( except the detached Jewel Tower ) were incorporated into its much larger replacement , which contains over 1,100 rooms organised symmetrically around two series of courtyards and which has a floor area of 112,476 m2 ( 1,210,680 sq ft ) . Part of the New Palace 's area of 3.24 hectares ( 8 acres ) was reclaimed from the River Thames , which is the setting of its nearly 300-metre long ( 980 ft ) fa\u00e7ade , called the River Front .

The building itself was a Benedictine monastic church until the monastery was dissolved in 1539 . Between 1540 and 1556 , the abbey had the status of a cathedral . Since 1560 , the building is no longer an abbey or a cathedral , having instead the status of a Church of England Royal Peculiar - a church responsible directly to the sovereign . According to a tradition first reported by Sulcard in about 1080 , a church was founded at the site ( then known as Thorn Ey ( Thorn Island ) ) in the seventh century , at the time of Mellitus , a Bishop of London . Construction of the present church began in 1245 , on the orders of King Henry III . Since the coronation of William the Conqueror in 1066 , all coronations of English and British monarchs have been in Westminster Abbey . There have been 16 royal weddings at the abbey since 1100 . As the burial site of more than 3,300 persons , usually of prominence in British history ( including at least sixteen monarchs , eight Prime Ministers , poets laureate , actors , scientists , military leaders , and the Unknown Warrior ) , Westminster Abbey is sometimes described as 'Britain 's Valhalla ' , after the iconic burial hall of Norse mythology .",

Restoration began in 1917 with the construction of County Hall at Lambeth replacing the Lion Brewery . Its Coade stone symbol was retained and placed on a pedestal at Westminster Bridge and is known as the South Bank Lion .

During the 19th century the station became the main London terminus for continental traffic via boat trains , and served several prestigious international services . It was badly damaged by an engineering accident in 1905 and extensively rebuilt , subsequently becoming an important meeting point for military and government traffic during World War I . By this time , Charing Cross station was seen as out of date by some politicians and proposals were made to replace Hungerford Bridge with a road bridge or road/rail combination , with the station moving to the south bank of the River Thames in the case of a road-only replacement .
