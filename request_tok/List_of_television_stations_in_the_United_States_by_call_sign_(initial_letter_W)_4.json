  "/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Service": "The Public Broadcasting Service ( PBS ) is an American public broadcaster and television program distributor . It is a nonprofit organization and the most prominent provider of educational television programming to public television stations in the United States , distributing series such as American Experience , America 's Test Kitchen , Antiques Roadshow , Arthur , Barney & Friends , Clifford the Big Red Dog , Downton Abbey , Finding Your Roots , Frontline , The Magic School Bus , Masterpiece , Mister Rogers ' Neighborhood , Nature , Nova , the PBS NewsHour , Reading Rainbow , Sesame Street , Teletubbies , and This Old House . PBS is funded by a combination of member station dues , the Corporation for Public Broadcasting , National Datacast , pledge drives , and donations from both private foundations and individual citizens . All proposed funding for programming is subject to a set of standards to ensure the program is free of influence from the funding source . Since the mid-2000s , Roper Opinion Research polls commissioned by PBS have consistently placed the service as the most-trusted national institution in the United States . A 2016-2017 study by Nielsen Media Research found 80% of all US television households view the network 's programs over the course of a year . However , PBS is not responsible for all programming carried on public television stations , a large proportion of which may come from its member stations , including WGBH-TV , WETA-TV , WNET , WTTW , WHYY-TV , Twin Cities PBS , American Public Television , and independent producers . This distinction regarding the origin of different programs on the service present a frequent source of viewer confusion . PBS has more than 350 member television stations , many owned by educational institutions , nonprofit groups both independent or affiliated with one particular local public school district or collegiate educational institution , or entities owned by or related to state government .",

  "/wiki/Religious_broadcasting": "Religious broadcasting refers to the dissemination of television and/or radio content that intentionally has religious ideas , religious experience , or religious practice as its core focus . In some countries , religious broadcasting developed primarily within the context of public service provision ( as in the UK ) , whilst in others , it has been driven more by religious organisations themselves ( as in the USA ) . Across Europe and in the US and Canada , religious broadcasting began in the earliest days of radio , usually with the transmission of religious worship , preaching or 'talks ' . Over time , formats evolved to include a broad range of styles and approaches , including radio and television drama , documentary , and chat show formats , as well as more traditional devotional content . Today , many religious organizations record sermons and lectures , and have moved into distributing content on their own web-based IP channels . Religious broadcasting can be funded commercially or through some sort of public broadcasting-style arrangement ( religious broadcasters are often recognized as non-profit organizations ) . Donations from listeners and viewers , often tax-deductible , are solicited by some broadcasters . In the US , 42 percent of non-commercial radio stations currently have a religious format where on the other hand about 80 percent of the 2,400 Christian radio stations and 100 full-power Christian TV stations throughout the entire United States are considered non-profit . In some countries , particularly those with an established state religion , broadcasting related to one particular religion only is allowed , or in some cases required . For example , a function of the state-owned Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation is by law to broadcast such programmes as may promote Islamic ideology , national unity and principles of democracy , freedom equality , tolerance and social justice as enunciated by Islam .
