The connected elements ( typically straight ) may be stressed from tension , compression , or sometimes both in response to dynamic loads . The basic types of truss bridges shown in this article have simple designs which could be easily analyzed by 19th and early 20th-century engineers . A truss bridge is economical to construct because it uses materials efficiently .",

  "/wiki/Brightwood_Beach_Cottage": "Brightwood Beach Cottage is an historic octagonal building on the southern shore of Lake Ripley in Litchfield , Minnesota , United States , that once was a part of the Brightwood Beach Resort of the late nineteenth century . The resort opened in 1889 , and it offered cultural amenities such as concerts , classes in fine arts , and other live entertainment . Other summer activities included dancing , ball games , and canoeing and steamboat excursions on Lake Ripley . The Minnesota Editorial Association , in a report at the time , called Brightwood the most lovely spot in Minnesota and a gem of a lake with pebbly shores and blue as the vaults of heaven . Thousands of people visited the resort , many of them wealthy individuals pictured in suits and fancy dresses , but the resort was not financially successful . In 1893 , the resort was forced to close , a victim of the Panic of 1893 and competition from resorts to the north that became accessible by railroad . The octagonal cottage that was used as a steamboat waiting area and landing station remained on Lake Ripley . It was sold to Dr. Frank E. Bissell and later to Tipton Fester McClure in 1907 . McClure was an investor in the Litchfield Glove Factory . The McClures rented it out after enclosing the south side with screens and making a kitchen and bedroom in the main part . Vern Sederstrom bought the house in 1950 and he sold it to Raynold and Myrtle Allen , whose son Richard was a close friend of my brother Mike . For many years , the octagonal cottage was the Allens summer home .",

It began on August 17 , 1862 , along the Minnesota River in southwest Minnesota , four years after its admission as a state . Throughout the late 1850s in the lead-up to the war , treaty violations by the United States and late or unfair annuity payments by Indian agents caused increasing hunger and hardship among the Dakota . During the war , the Dakota made extensive attacks on hundreds of settlers and immigrants , which resulted in settler deaths , and caused many to flee the area . Intense desire for immediate revenge ended with soldiers capturing hundreds of Dakota men and interning their families . A military tribunal quickly tried the men , sentencing 303 to death for their crimes . President Lincoln would later commute the sentence of 264 of them . The mass hanging of 38 Dakota men was conducted on December 26 , 1862 , in Mankato , Minnesota ; it was the largest mass execution in United States history . Traders with the Dakota previously had demanded that the government give the annuity payments directly to them ( introducing the possibility of unfair dealing between the agents and the traders to the exclusion of the Dakota ) . In mid-1862 , the Dakota demanded the annuities directly from their agent , Thomas J. Galbraith . The traders refused to provide any more supplies on credit under those conditions , and negotiations reached an impasse . On August 17 , 1862 , one young Dakota with a hunting party of three others killed five settlers while on a hunting expedition .",

  "/wiki/Carpenter_Gothic": "Carpenter Gothic , also sometimes called Carpenter 's Gothic or Rural Gothic , is a North American architectural style-designation for an application of Gothic Revival architectural detailing and picturesque massing applied to wooden structures built by house-carpenters . The abundance of North American timber and the carpenter-built vernacular architectures based upon it made a picturesque improvisation upon Gothic a natural evolution . Carpenter Gothic improvises upon features that were carved in stone in authentic Gothic architecture , whether original or in more scholarly revival styles ; however , in the absence of the restraining influence of genuine Gothic structures , the style was freed to improvise and emphasize charm and quaintness rather than fidelity to received models . The genre received its impetus from the publication by Alexander Jackson Davis of Rural Residences and from detailed plans and elevations in publications by Andrew Jackson Downing .",

  "/wiki/Universal_Laboratories_Building": "Universal Laboratories Building is a building in Dassel , Minnesota , United States , listed on the National Register of Historic Places . It was listed on the National Register for its role in the production of ergot from the mid-1930s through the late 1960s . The business was established in 1935 as Rice Laboratories , as a manufacturer of yeast for livestock feed . Yeast was used as a feed supplement because the enzymes fermenting in the digestive tracts of hogs and poultry would break down food and help in nutrient absorption . In 1937 , the company built a new building on the north edge of town . In that same year , the manager of the company , Lester R. Peel , started production of ergot . Local farmers were discarding rye that was infected with sclerotia growths , because the ergot could cause deadly poisoning . Peel , a former school teacher , understood that the ergot also had medical applications , such as controlling postpartum bleeding and treating vasoconstriction , hypertension , vascular headaches , and migraines . Peel gave the ergot business the name Universal Laboratories . Production initially began with ergotic rye bought from local farmers . Universal Laboratories staff would then bring the rye through small mills that would break up the rye kernels . They would then pick the grain from the conveyor belt and let the ergot fall into a receptacle for bagging .",

The most prominent member of this group is Claviceps purpurea ( rye ergot fungus ) . This fungus grows on rye and related plants , and produces alkaloids that can cause ergotism in humans and other mammals who consume grains contaminated with its fruiting structure ( called ergot sclerotium ) . Claviceps includes about 50 known species , mostly in the tropical regions . Economically significant species include C. purpurea ( parasitic on grasses and cereals ) , C. fusiformis ( on pearl millet , buffel grass ) , C. paspali ( on dallis grass ) , C. africana ( on sorghum ) , and C. lutea ( on paspalum ) . C. purpurea most commonly affects outcrossing species such as rye ( its most common host ) , as well as triticale , wheat , and barley . It affects oats only rarely . C. purpurea has at least three races or varieties , which differ in their host specificity :"
