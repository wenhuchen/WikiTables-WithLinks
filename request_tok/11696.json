  "/wiki/Artificial_intelligence": "In computer science , artificial intelligence ( AI ) , sometimes called machine intelligence , is intelligence demonstrated by machines , in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans . Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of intelligent agents : any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals . Colloquially , the term artificial intelligence is often used to describe machines ( or computers ) that mimic cognitive functions that humans associate with the human mind , such as learning and problem solving . As machines become increasingly capable , tasks considered to require intelligence are often removed from the definition of AI , a phenomenon known as the AI effect . A quip in Tesler 's Theorem says AI is whatever has n't been done yet . For instance , optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI , having become a routine technology . Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech , competing at the highest level in strategic game systems ( such as chess and Go ) , autonomously operating cars , intelligent routing in content delivery networks , and military simulations . Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955 , and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism , followed by disappointment and the loss of funding ( known as an AI winter ) , followed by new approaches , success and renewed funding . For most of its history , AI research has been divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other . These sub-fields are based on technical considerations , such as particular goals ( e.g . robotics or machine learning ) , the use of particular tools ( logic or artificial neural networks ) , or deep philosophical differences . Subfields have also been based on social factors ( particular institutions or the work of particular researchers ) .",
