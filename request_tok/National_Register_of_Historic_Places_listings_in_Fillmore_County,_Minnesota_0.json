  "/wiki/Allis-Chalmers": "Allis-Chalmers was a U.S. manufacturer of machinery for various industries . Its business lines included agricultural equipment , construction equipment , power generation and power transmission equipment , and machinery for use in industrial settings such as factories , flour mills , sawmills , textile mills , steel mills , refineries , mines , and ore mills . The first Allis-Chalmers Company was formed in 1901 as an amalgamation of the Edward P. Allis Company ( steam engines and mill equipment ) , Fraser & Chalmers ( mining and ore milling equipment ) , the Gates Iron Works ( rock and cement milling equipment ) , and the industrial business line of the Dickson Manufacturing Company ( engines and compressors ) . It was reorganized in 1912 as the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company . During the next 70 years its industrial machinery filled countless mills , mines , and factories around the world , and its brand gained fame among consumers mostly from its farm equipment business 's orange tractors and silver combine harvesters . In the 1980s and 1990s a series of divestitures transformed the firm and eventually dissolved it . Its successors today are Allis-Chalmers Energy and AGCO .",

  "/wiki/Box_culvert": "A culvert is a structure that allows water to flow under a road , railroad , trail , or similar obstruction from one side to the other . Typically embedded so as to be surrounded by soil , a culvert may be made from a pipe , reinforced concrete or other material . In the United Kingdom , the word can also be used for a longer artificially buried watercourse . Culverts are commonly used both as cross-drains to relieve drainage of ditches at the roadside , and to pass water under a road at natural drainage and stream crossings . A culvert may be a bridge-like structure designed to allow vehicle or pedestrian traffic to cross over the waterway while allowing adequate passage for the water . Culverts come in many sizes and shapes including round , elliptical , flat-bottomed , open-bottomed , pear-shaped , and box-like constructions . The culvert type and shape selection is based on a number of factors including requirements for hydraulic performance , limitations on upstream water surface elevation , and roadway embankment height . The process of removing culverts to restore an open-air watercourse is known as daylighting . In the UK , the practice is also known as deculverting .",

  "/wiki/Prairie_School": "Prairie School is a late 19th- and early 20th-century architectural style , most common in the Midwestern United States . The style is usually marked by horizontal lines , flat or hipped roofs with broad overhanging eaves , windows grouped in horizontal bands , integration with the landscape , solid construction , craftsmanship , and discipline in the use of ornament . Horizontal lines were thought to evoke and relate to the wide , flat , treeless expanses of America 's native prairie landscape . The Prairie School was an attempt at developing an indigenous North American style of architecture in symphony with the ideals and design aesthetics of the Arts and Crafts Movement , with which it shared an embrace of handcrafting and craftsman guilds as an antidote to the dehumanizing effects of mass production . The term Prairie School was not actually used by practitioners of the style . Architect Marion Mahony , for example , preferred the phrase The Chicago Group . Its term was coined by H. Allen Brooks , one of the first architectural historians to write extensively about the movement and its work .",

  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",

  "/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_(1865\u20131918)": "The history of the United States from 1865 until 1918 covers the Reconstruction Era , the Gilded Age , and the Progressive Era , and includes the rise of industrialization and the resulting surge of immigration in the United States . This article focuses on political , economic , and diplomatic history . This period of rapid economic growth and soaring prosperity in the North and the West ( but not in the South ) saw the U.S. become the world 's dominant economic , industrial , and agricultural power . The average annual income ( after inflation ) of non-farm workers grew by 75% from 1865 to 1900 , and then grew another 33% by 1918 . With a decisive victory in 1865 over Southern secessionists in the Civil War , the United States became a united and powerful nation with a strong national government . Reconstruction brought the end of legalized slavery plus citizenship for the former slaves , but their new-found political power was rolled back within a decade , and they became second-class citizens under a Jim Crow system of deeply pervasive segregation that would stand for the next 80-90 years . Politically , during the Third Party System and Fourth Party System the nation was mostly dominated by Republicans ( except for two Democratic presidents ) . After 1900 and the assassination of President William McKinley , the Progressive Era brought political , business , and social reforms ( e.g. , new roles for and government expansion of education , higher status for women , a curtailment of corporate excesses , and modernization of many areas of government and society ) . The Progressives worked through new middle-class organizations to fight against the corruption and behind-the-scenes power of entrenched , state political party organizations and big-city machines . They demanded - and won - women 's right to vote , and the nationwide prohibition of alcohol 1920-1933 . In an unprecedented wave of European immigration , 27.5 million new arrivals between 1865 and 1918 provided the labor base necessary for the expansion of industry and agriculture , as well as the population base for most of fast-growing urban America . By the late nineteenth century , the United States had become a leading global industrial power , building on new technologies ( such as the telegraph and steel ) , an expanding railroad network , and abundant natural resources such as coal , timber , oil , and farmland , to usher in the Second Industrial Revolution .",

  "/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland .",

  "/wiki/National_Park_Service_rustic": "National Park Service rustic - sometimes colloquially called Parkitecture - is a style of architecture that developed in the early and middle 20th century in the United States National Park Service ( NPS ) through its efforts to create buildings that harmonized with the natural environment . Since its founding in 1916 , the NPS sought to design and build visitor facilities without visually interrupting the natural or historic surroundings . The early results were characterized by intensive use of hand labor and a rejection of the regularity and symmetry of the industrial world , reflecting connections with the Arts and Crafts movement and American Picturesque architecture . Architects , landscape architects and engineers combined native wood and stone with convincingly native styles to create visually appealing structures that seemed to fit naturally within the majestic landscapes . Examples of the style can be found in numerous types of National Park structures , including entrance gateways , hotels and lodges , park roads and bridges , visitor centers , trail shelters , informational kiosks , and even mundane maintenance and support facilities .

They provided support for farmers , the unemployed , youth and the elderly . The New Deal included new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and efforts to re-inflate the economy after prices had fallen sharply . New Deal programs included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt . The programs focused on what historians refer to as the 3 Rs : relief for the unemployed and poor , recovery of the economy back to normal levels , and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression . The New Deal produced a political realignment , making the Democratic Party the majority ( as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 to 1969 ) with its base in liberal ideas , the South , traditional [ clarification needed ] Democrats , big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions and non-whites and ethnic whites .

  "/wiki/Shingle_style_architecture": "The Shingle style is an American architectural style made popular by the rise of the New England school of architecture , which eschewed the highly ornamented patterns of the Eastlake style in Queen Anne architecture . In the Shingle style , English influence was combined with the renewed interest in Colonial American architecture which followed the 1876 celebration of the Centennial . The plain , shingled surfaces of colonial buildings were adopted , and their massing emulated . Aside from being a style of design , the style also conveyed a sense of the house as continuous volume . This effect - of the building as an envelope of space , rather than a great mass , was enhanced by the visual tautness of the flat shingled surfaces , the horizontal shape of many Shingle style houses , and the emphasis on horizontal continuity , both in exterior details and in the flow of spaces within the houses .",

  "/wiki/Bernard_Pietenpol": "Bernard H. Pietenpol ( 1901-1984 ) was an aircraft designer . A designer of homebuilt aircraft , Pietenpol was a self-taught mechanic who lived most of his life in the small community of Cherry Grove in southeastern Minnesota . His best-known design , the Pietenpol Air Camper , was meant to be built and flown by the average American of the 1930s . The Air Camper is a two-place open cockpit monoplane with parasol wing built from material that was , in the 1930s , readily available from local sources . Powered by a Ford Model A engine , and first flown with one in May 1929 , Pietenpol 's design was sturdy , simple and affordable . Plans were first published in Modern Mechanics and Inventions , then in the magazine 's 1932 Flying and Glider Manual . With the success of the Air Camper , MMI editor Weston Farmer convinced Pietenpol to design an airplane that could be powered with the cheaper and more readily available Ford Model T engine . In response to Farmer 's request , Pietenpol designed the single-place Pietenpol Sky Scout . Air Campers have been built using many ( over 50 have been recorded ) different power plants . Pietenpol himself liked the air-cooled Corvair engine . But his original design is well suited to the high torque , slow-turning Model A . A restored example of the Air Camper can be found in the inventory of the Mid-Atlantic Air Museum in Reading , Pennsylvania ."
