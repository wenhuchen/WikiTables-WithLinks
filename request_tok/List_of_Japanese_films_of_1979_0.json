  "/wiki/Help:Disambiguation": "Disambiguation pages on Wikipedia are used as a process of resolving conflicts in article titles that occur when a single term can be associated with more than one topic , making that term likely to be the natural title for more than one article . In other words , disambiguations are paths leading to different articles which could , in principle , have the same title . For example , the word Mercury can refer to several different things , including an element , a planet , and a Roman god . Since only one Wikipedia page can have the generic name Mercury , unambiguous article titles are used for each of these topics : Mercury ( element ) , Mercury ( planet ) , Mercury ( mythology ) . There must then be a way to direct the reader to the correct specific article when the ambiguous word Mercury is referenced by linking , browsing or searching ; this is what is known as disambiguation .
