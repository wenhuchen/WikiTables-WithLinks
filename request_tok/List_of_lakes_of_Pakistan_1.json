It was previously known as the North-West Frontier Province until 2010 when the name was changed to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by the 18th Amendment to Pakistan 's Constitution and is known colloquially by various other names . Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the third-largest province of Pakistan by the size of both population and economy , though it is geographically the smallest of four . Within Pakistan , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shares a border with Punjab , Balochistan , Azad Kashmir , Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad . It is home to 17.9% of Pakistan 's total population , with the majority of the province 's inhabitants being Pashtuns and Hindko speakers . The province is the site of the ancient kingdom Gandhara , including the ruins of its capital Pushkalavati near modern-day Charsadda . Originally a stronghold of Buddhism , the history of the region was characterized by frequent invasions by various empires due to its geographical proximity to the Khyber Pass . Since the 9/11 attacks in the United States in 2001 , the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been a major theatre of militancy and terrorism which intensified when the Taliban began an unsuccessful attempt to seize the control of the province in 2004 . With the launch of Operation Zarb-e-Azb against the Taliban insurgency , the casualty and crime rates in the country as a whole dropped by 40.0% as compared to 2011-13 , with even greater drops noted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas . As of July 2014 , about 929,859 people were reported to be internally displaced from North Waziristan to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as a result of Operation Zarb-e-Azb . On March 2 , 2017 , the Government of Pakistan considered a proposal to merge the Federally Administered Tribal Areas with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , and to repeal the Frontier Crimes Regulations , which are currently applicable to the tribal areas . However , some political parties have opposed the merger , and called for the tribal areas to instead become a separate province of Pakistan .",
  "/wiki/Lake": "A lake is an area filled with water , localized in a basin , surrounded by land , apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake . Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean , and therefore are distinct from lagoons , and are also larger and deeper than ponds , though there are no official or scientific definitions . Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams , which are usually flowing . Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams . Natural lakes are generally found in mountainous areas , rift zones , and areas with ongoing glaciation . Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers . In some parts of the world there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age . All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales , as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them . Many lakes are artificial and are constructed for industrial or agricultural use , for hydro-electric power generation or domestic water supply , or for aesthetic , recreational purposes , or other activities .",

It shares the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe and the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa . Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometres ( 17,212,000 sq mi ) , about 30% of Earth 's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth 's total surface area . The continent , which has long been home to the majority of the human population , was the site of many of the first civilizations . Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population , but also dense and large settlements , as well as vast barely populated regions . Its 4.5 billion people ( as of June 2019 [ update ] ) constitute roughly 60% of the world 's population , more than all other continents combined . In general terms , Asia is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean , on the south by the Indian Ocean , and on the north by the Arctic Ocean . The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural construct , as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them . It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity . The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East-West cultural , linguistic , and ethnic differences , some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line . The most commonly accepted boundaries place Asia to the east of the Suez Canal separating it from Africa ; and to the east of the Turkish Straits , the Ural Mountains and Ural River , and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black Seas , separating it from Europe . China and India alternated in being the largest economies in the world from 1 to 1800 CE .",
