  "/wiki/Pacific_Southwest_Airlines": "Pacific Southwest Airlines ( PSA ) was a United States airline headquartered in San Diego , California , that operated from 1949 to 1988 . It was the first large discount airline in the United States . PSA called itself The World 's Friendliest Airline and painted a smile on the nose of its airplanes , the PSA Grinningbirds . Opinion L.A. of the Los Angeles Times called PSA practically the unofficial flag carrier airline of California for almost 40 years . The airline initially operated as an intrastate airline wholly within the state of California . This strategy which avoided the steep costs from federal regulation would later serve as the model for Southwest Airlines , doing in Texas what PSA had done in California . After the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 , PSA expanded to cities in other western states , and eventually to several cities in Mexico . In 1986 PSA became the first of two airlines that merged into the existing USAir , followed by Piedmont Airlines in 1987 . The PSA acquisition was completed in 1988 . USAir changed its name to US Airways in 1997 . In 2005 , after its second bankruptcy filing , America West Airlines acquired US Airways , continuing with the name until it merged with American Airlines in 2015 . In November 1995 the PSA name was given to Jetstream International Airlines , becoming PSA Airlines , so that US Airways could preserve the PSA name and trademarks .",
  "/wiki/Douglas_DC-3": "The Douglas DC-3 is a propeller-driven airliner which had a lasting effect on the airline industry in the 1930s/1940s and World War II . It was developed as a larger , improved 14-bed sleeper version of the Douglas DC-2 . It is a low-wing metal monoplane with a tailwheel landing gear , powered by two 1,200 hp ( 890 kW ) Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp radial piston engines . It has a cruise speed of 207 mph ( 333 km/h ) , capacity of 21 to 32 passengers or 6,000 lbs ( 2,700 kg ) of cargo , a range of 1,500 mi ( 2,400 km ) , and could operate from short runways . Before the war , it pioneered many air travel routes as it could cross the continental US and made worldwide flights possible , carried passengers in greater comfort , and was reliable and easy to maintain . It is considered the first airliner that could profitably carry only passengers . Following the war , the airliner market was flooded with surplus military transport aircraft , and the DC-3 could not be upgraded by Douglas due to cost . It was made obsolete on main routes by more advanced types such as the Douglas DC-6 and Lockheed Constellation , but the design proved adaptable and useful . Civil DC-3 production ended in 1942 at 607 aircraft . Military versions , including the C-47 Skytrain ( the Dakota in British RAF service ) , and Soviet- and Japanese-built versions , brought total production to over 16,000 . Many continue to see service in a variety of niche roles : 2,000 DC-3s and military derivatives were estimated to be still flying in 2013 . [ contradictory ]",

  "/wiki/Fokker_F28_Fellowship": "The Fokker F28 Fellowship is a twin-engine short range jet airliner designed and built by Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker . Following the Fokker F27 Friendship , an early and commercially successful turboprop-powered regional airliner , Fokker decided to embark on developing a new turbojet-powered commuter aircraft that would build upon its experiences with the F27 . During the design phase , a high level of attention was paid to market research and operator concerns ; amongst other changes made , the prospective jetliner was increased in size , changing its maximum seating capacity from 50 to 65 passengers . During April 1962 , Fokker announced the formal launch of the F28 Fellowship . On 9 May 1967 , the prototype F28-1000 conducted its maiden flight . Type certification was achieved on 24 February 1969 , and the first revenue-earning flight by Braathens was performed on 28 March 1969 . Following its entry to service , Fokker developed multiple variants of the F28 ; one model , the F28-2000 , featured an extended fuselage that could accommodate up to 79 passengers . A major revision was the F28-4000 , which was powered by quieter Rolls-Royce Spey 555-15H engines , a redesigned cockpit , a modified wing , and had a further increased seating capacity of up to 85 passengers . During 1987 , production of the type was terminated in favour of two newer derivatives , the Fokker 70 and the larger Fokker 100 .",

It was the second short-haul jet airliner to enter service , following the French Sud Aviation Caravelle . The aircraft was also produced under licence in Romania during the 1980s as the Rombac One-Eleven . The One-Eleven was conceived by Hunting Aircraft and developed by the British Aircraft Corporation when Hunting merged into BAC along with other British aircraft manufacturers in 1960 . The One-Eleven was intended to replace the turboprop Vickers Viscount on short-range routes . The One-Eleven entered the market ahead of rivals such as the Douglas DC-9-10 , which gave it a temporary edge on the market . The aircraft proved popular with domestic airlines and various international operators . Over half of the One-Eleven 's sales at launch were to the US . The One-Eleven was one of the most successful British airliner designs , and served until a widespread retirement in the 1990s , which was partly due to the introduction of aircraft noise restrictions in many European nations . As of May 2019 , no BAC One-Eleven aircraft remain in service following Northrop-Grumman 's retirement of their last aircraft .",

The first wide-body airplane produced , it was the first plane dubbed a Jumbo Jet . Its distinctive hump upper deck along the forward part of the aircraft has made it one of the most recognizable aircraft . Manufactured by Boeing 's Commercial Airplane unit in the United States , the 747 was originally planned to have 150 percent greater capacity than the Boeing 707 , a common large commercial aircraft of the 1960s . First flown commercially in 1970 , the 747 held the passenger capacity record for 37 years . The 747 uses a double-deck configuration for part of its length and is available in passenger , freighter , and other versions . Boeing designed the 747 's hump-like upper deck to serve as a first-class lounge or extra seating , and to allow the aircraft to be easily converted to a cargo carrier by removing seats and installing a front cargo door . Boeing expected supersonic airliners - the development of which was announced in the early 1960s - to render the 747 and other subsonic airliners obsolete , while the demand for subsonic cargo aircraft would remain robust well into the future . Though the 747 was expected to become obsolete after 400 were sold , production passed 1,000 in 1993 .
