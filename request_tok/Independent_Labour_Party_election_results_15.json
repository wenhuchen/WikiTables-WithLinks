From 1931 to 1935 , he headed a National Government dominated by the Conservative Party and supported by only a few Labour members . MacDonald was later vehemently denounced by and expelled from the party he had helped to found . MacDonald , along with Keir Hardie and Arthur Henderson , was one of the three principal founders of the Labour Party . He was chairman of the Labour MPs before 1914 and , after an eclipse in his career caused by his opposition to the First World War , he was Leader of the Labour Party from 1922 . The second Labour Government ( 1929-31 ) was dominated by the Great Depression . He formed the National Government to carry out spending cuts to defend the gold standard , but it had to be abandoned after the Invergordon Mutiny , and he called a general election in 1931 seeking a doctor 's mandate to fix the economy . The National coalition won an overwhelming landslide and the Labour Party was reduced to a rump of around 50 seats in the House of Commons . His health deteriorated and he stood down as Prime Minister in 1935 , remaining as Lord President of the Council until retiring in 1937 . He died later that year . MacDonald 's speeches , pamphlets and books made him an important theoretician . Historian John Shepherd states that MacDonald 's natural gifts of an imposing presence , handsome features and a persuasive oratory delivered with an arresting Highlands accent made him the iconic Labour leader .",
