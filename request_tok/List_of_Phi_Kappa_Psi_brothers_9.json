Davis was a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy , and colonel of a volunteer regiment during the Mexican-American War .

By March 1861 , the Provisional Confederate Congress expanded the provisional forces and established a more permanent Confederate States Army . An accurate count of the total number of individuals who served in the Confederate Army is not possible due to incomplete and destroyed Confederate records ; estimates of the number of individual Confederate soldiers are between 750,000 and 1,000,000 men . This does not include an unknown number of slaves who were pressed into performing various tasks for the army , such as construction of fortifications and defenses or driving wagons .

Although most of the soldiers who fought in the American Civil War were volunteers , both sides by 1862 resorted to conscription , primarily as a means to force men to register and to volunteer .

The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the war 's turning point . Union Maj. Gen. George Meade 's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia , halting Lee 's invasion of the North . After his success at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863 , Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley to begin his second invasion of the North - the Gettysburg Campaign . With his army in high spirits , Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , or even Philadelphia . Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln , Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit , but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade . Elements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1 , 1863 , as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there , his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it . Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig . Gen. John Buford , and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry . However , two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north , collapsing the hastily developed Union lines , sending the defenders retreating through the streets of the town to the hills just to the south . On the second day of battle , most of both armies had assembled . The Union line was laid out in a defensive formation resembling a fishhook .",
