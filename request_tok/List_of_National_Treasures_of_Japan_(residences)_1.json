  "/wiki/Shake_(shingle)": "Wood shingles are thin , tapered pieces of wood primarily used to cover roofs and walls of buildings to protect them from the weather . Historically shingles were split from straight grained , knot free bolts of wood . Today shingles are mostly made by being cut which distinguishes them from shakes which are made by being split out of a bolt . Wooden shingle roofs were prevalent in the North American colonies ( for example in the Cape-Cod-style house ) , while in central and southern Europe at the same time , thatch , slate and tile were the prevalent roofing materials . In rural Scandinavia , wood shingle roofs were a common roofing material until the 1950s . [ disputed - discuss ] Wood shingles are susceptible to fire and cost more than other types of shingle so they are not as common today as in the past . Distinctive shingle patterns exist in various regions created by the size , shape , and application method . Special treatments such as swept valleys , combed ridges , decorative butt ends , and decorative patterns impart a special character to each building . Wood shingles can also be shaped by steam bending to create a thatch-like appearance , with unique roof details and contours .",

Established in its current location in 1591 , the origin of the temple goes back to the 14th century . Many of its building have survived from the Azuchi-Momoyama and early Edo period , making it a great example of the Japanese architecture from the 17th and 18th centuries . A total of seven Nishi Hongan-ji structures have been designated National Treasures in three different categories : the karamon , Goei-d\u014d and Amida hall ( temple buildings ) , the Flying Cloud Pavilion , shoin and the Black study hall , including the Denr\u014d gallery ( residences ) and the north Noh stage ( miscellaneous structure ) .

  "/wiki/Shoin": "Shoin ( \u66f8\u9662 , drawing room or study ) is a type of audience hall in Japanese architecture that was developed during the Muromachi period . The term originally meant a study and a place for lectures on the s\u016btra within a temple , but later it came to mean just a drawing room or study . From this room takes its name the shoin-zukuri style . In a shoin-zukuri building , the shoin is the zashiki , a tatami-room dedicated to the reception of guests . The emerging architecture of the Muromachi period was subsequently influenced by the increasing use and appearance of shoin . One of the most noticeable changes in architecture to arise from the shoin came from the practice of lining their floors with tatami mats . Since tatami mats have a standardized size the floor plans for shoin rooms had to be developed around the proportions of the tatami mat ; this in turn affected the proportions of doors , the height of rooms , and other aspects of the structure . Before the shoin popularized the practice of lining floors with tatami mats it had been standard to only bring out a single tatami mat for the highest-ranking person in the room to sit on . The architecture surrounding and influenced by the shoin quickly developed many other distinguishing features . Since the guests sat on the floor instead of on furniture , they were positioned at a lower vantage point than their Chinese counterparts who were accustomed to using furniture . This lower vantage point generated such developments as the suspended ceilings which functioned to make the room feel less expansive , and also resulted in the ceilings rafters being no longer visible as they were in China . The new suspended ceilings also allowed for more elaborate decoration , resulting in many highly ornate suspended ceilings in addition to the much simpler ones .",
  "/wiki/Mezzanine_(architecture)": "A mezzanine ( /\u02ccm\u025bz\u0259\u02c8ni\u02d0n/ ; or in French , an entresol ) is , strictly speaking , an intermediate floor in a building which is partly open to the double-height ceilinged floor below , or which does not extend over the whole floorspace of the building . However , the term is often used loosely for the floor above the ground floor , especially where a very high original ground floor has been split horizontally into two floors . Mezzanines may serve a wide variety of functions . Industrial mezzanines , such as those used in warehouses , may be temporary or semi-permanent structures . In French architecture , entresol also means a room created by partitioning that does not go up all the way to the ceiling ; these were historically common in France , for example in the apartments for the nobility at the Palace of Versailles .",
  "/wiki/Hip_roof": "A hip roof , hip-roof or hipped roof , is a type of roof where all sides slope downwards to the walls , usually with a fairly gentle slope ( although a tented roof by definition is a hipped roof with steeply pitched slopes rising to a peak ) . Thus , a hipped roof house has no gables or other vertical sides to the roof . A square hip roof is shaped like a pyramid . Hip roofs on houses could have two triangular sides and two trapezoidal ones . A hip roof on a rectangular plan has four faces . They are almost always at the same pitch or slope , which makes them symmetrical about the centerlines . Hip roofs often have a consistent level fascia , meaning that a gutter can be fitted all around . Hip roofs often have dormer slanted sides .",
  "/wiki/Gabled_roof": "A gable is the generally triangular portion of a wall between the edges of intersecting roof pitches . The shape of the gable and how it is detailed depends on the structural system used , which reflects climate , material availability , and aesthetic concerns . A gable wall or gable end more commonly refers to the entire wall , including the gable and the wall below it . Some types of roofs do not have a gable ( for example hip roofs do not ) . One common type of roof with gables , the gable roof , is named after its prominent gables . A parapet made of a series of curves ( Dutch gable ) or horizontal steps ( crow-stepped gable ) may hide the diagonal lines of the roof . Gable ends of more recent buildings are often treated in the same way as the Classic pediment form . But unlike Classical structures , which operate through trabeation , the gable ends of many buildings are actually bearing-wall structures . Thus , the detailing can be ambiguous or misleading . [ citation needed ] Gable style is also used in the design of fabric structures , with varying degree sloped roofs , dependent on how much snowfall is expected . Sharp gable roofs are a characteristic of the Gothic and classical Greek styles of architecture . The opposite or inverted form of a gable roof is a V-roof or butterfly roof .",
  "/wiki/Bargeboard": "Bargeboard ( probably from Medieval Latin bargus , or barcus , a scaffold , and not from the now obsolete synonym vergeboard ) is a board fastened to the projecting gables of a roof to give them strength , protection , and to conceal the otherwise exposed end of the horizontal timbers or purlins of the roof to which they were attached . Bargeboards are sometimes moulded only or carved , but as a rule the lower edges were cusped and had tracery in the spandrels besides being otherwise elaborated . An example in Britain was one at Ockwells in Berkshire ( built 1446-1465 ) , which was moulded and carved as if it were intended for internal work . In New Orleans , bargeboard is the wood from which many of the creole cottages were constructed in the early to mid-1800s . Barges were constructed up-river to carry goods to New Orleans , and upon arrival dismantled and used for construction of houses . The planks are generally 2 inches ( 5.1 cm ) thick and of varying lengths and widths , although 10 inches ( 25 cm ) width is common . It is hard , solid wood that has lasted between 150 and 200 years in a wet , humid climate . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/Tai-an": "Tai-an ( \u5f85\u5eb5 ) is a Momoyama period chashitsu ( Japanese tea house ) located at My\u014dki-an temple in Yamazaki , Kyoto . Tai-an was designed by the great tea master Sen no Riky\u016b in 1582 . Sen no Riky\u016b was named the tea master of Toyotomi Hideyoshi that same year , following Oda Nobunaga 's death , and as Hideyoshi was battling around the area at the time , they often held tea ceremonies there . In fact it is often said that it was built for exactly this purpose . An example of the smallest type of chashitsu , its main layout consists of one tatami mat for the host and another one for the guest . On the north side , where the tea house connects with another building , there is a tokonoma . The entrance , on the south side , is said to have been designed larger than usual in order to allow Hideyoshi to enter with his armor on . On the west side there is another one mat area with a shelf for tea utensils , and a tablet with the name of the teahouse hanging near the ceiling . Tai-an is the only teahouse definitely attributed to Sen no Riky\u016b , and as such it is designated a National Treasure . It can be visited with advanced reservations with an entrance fee .",

  "/wiki/Crown_Prince": "A crown prince is the male heir apparent to the throne in a royal or imperial monarchy . The female form of the title is crown princess , which may refer either to an heir apparent or , especially in earlier times , to the wife of the person styled crown prince . Crown prince as a descriptive term has been used throughout history for the prince who is first-in-line to a throne and is expected to succeed ( i.e . the heir apparent ) , barring any unforeseen future event preventing this . In certain monarchies , a more specific substantive title may be accorded and become associated with the position of heir apparent ( e.g . Prince of Wales in the United Kingdom ) . In these monarchies , the term crown prince may be used less often than the substantive title ( or never ) . Until the late twentieth century , no modern monarchy adopted a system whereby females would be guaranteed to succeed to the throne ( i.e . absolute primogeniture ) . A crown princess would therefore be more likely to refer to the spouse of a crown prince . She would be styled crown princess , not in her own right but by courtesy .",

Modern Tokyo is categorized as an alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network . As of 2019 , the population of Tokyo was estimated to be over 13.9 million , making it Japan 's most populous prefecture . The metropolitan area is the world 's most populous with over 40 million people as well as the world 's largest urban agglomeration economy .
