  "/wiki/Before_Present": "Before Present ( BP ) years is a time scale used mainly in archaeology , geology and other scientific disciplines to specify when events occurred in the past . Because the present time changes , standard practice is to use 1 January 1950 as the commencement date ( epoch ) of the age scale , [ a ] reflecting the origin of practical radiocarbon dating in the 1950s . The abbreviation BP has been interpreted retrospectively as Before Physics ; that refers to the time before nuclear weapons testing artificially altered the proportion of the carbon isotopes in the atmosphere , making dating after that time likely to be unreliable . In a convention that is not always observed , many sources restrict the use of BP dates to those produced with radiocarbon dating ; the alternative notation RCYBP is explicitly Radio Carbon Years Before Present .",

The port city of Iquique ( 2002 pop . 216,419 ) is the region 's capital . Much of the region was once the Tarapac\u00e1 Province of Peru , which was annexed by Chile under the 1883 Treaty of Anc\u00f3n at the close of the War of the Pacific . The region was important economically as a site of intense saltpeter mining , before synthetic nitrate manufacturing became possible . A number of abandoned mining towns can still be found in the region .

  "/wiki/San_Pedro_(Chile_volcano)": "San Pedro is a Holocene composite volcano in northern Chile and one of the tallest active volcanoes in the world . Part of the Chilean Andes ' volcanic segment , it is part of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes , one of the four tracts of the Andean Volcanic Belt . This region of volcanism includes the world 's two highest volcanoes Ojos del Salado and Llullaillaco . San Pedro , like other Andean volcanoes , was formed by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate . It has a neighbouring volcano , San Pablo , and is itself formed by two separate edifices usually known as the Old Cone and the Young Cone . These edifices are formed by rocks ranging from basaltic andesite over andesite to dacite and are emplaced on a basement formed by Miocene volcanic rocks . The Old Cone was active over one hundred thousand years ago and was eventually truncated by a giant landslide that removed its northwestern side . Within the landslide scar lava flows and pyroclastic flows constructed the Young Cone as well as the lateral centre La Poru\u00f1a . This volcano was glaciated during the Pleistocene and a large Plinian eruption occurred at the beginning of the Holocene . Some eruptions reportedly occurred during historical time ; presently the volcano is fumarolically active .",

To the east it borders Bolivia and Argentina . The capital of the region is the port city of Antofagasta , another important city being Calama . The main economic activity is copper mining in the giant porphyry copper systems located inland . Climate is extremely arid albeit somewhat milder near the coast . Nearly all of the region is devoid of vegetation except close to the Loa River or at oasises such as San Pedro de Atacama . Much of the inland is covered by salt flats , tephra and lava flows . The coast exhibits prominent cliffs . The region was sparsely populated by indigenous Changos and Atacame\u00f1os until massive Chilean immigration in conjunction with a saltpeter boom in the later 19th century . The region used to be Bolivian until the War of the Pacific broke out in 1879 .",
  "/wiki/Lascar_(volcano)": "Lascar is a stratovolcano within the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes , a volcanic arc that spans the countries of Peru , Bolivia , Argentina and Chile . It is the most active volcano in the region , with records of eruptions going back to 1848 . It is composed of two separate cones with several summit craters . The westernmost crater of the eastern cone is presently active . Volcanic activity is characterized by constant release of volcanic gas and occasional vulcanian eruptions . Lascar has been active since at least 56,000 years ago , though some argue for activity beginning 220,000 years ago . The first known activity occurred at the eastern cone and was characterized by lava flows , before shifting to the western cone where lava domes were emplaced . An eruption event known as Piedras Grandes was followed by the large Soncor eruption . A new western edifice was constructed on top of the Soncor vent , during the Holocene activity then shifted again to the eastern edifice and continues there to this day . The magma supplied to the volcano ultimately comes from the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate . A number of other volcanoes are found in the region , such as Aguas Calientes , Cordon de Puntas Negras and the giant La Pacana caldera . The volcano experienced at least three major eruptions throughout its history : One is the Soncor eruption about 26,450 \u00b1 500 years ago , another in 7,250 BCE and the third in 1993 .",

The bulk of the volcanic field is in the Talca province of Chile 's Maule Region . It is a segment of the Southern Volcanic Zone , part of the Andean Volcanic Belt . Many of the volcanic centres in the Laguna del Maule volcanic field formed during postglacial times , after glaciers had retreated from the area . This activity has generated cones , lava domes , lava coulees and lava flows which surround Laguna del Maule lake . The field gets its name from the lake which is also the source of the Maule river . Some of the volcanic centres were active during and before the last glaciation ; at least three caldera formation events are associated with the system . About 130 volcanic vents belong to the field , whose activity began 1.5 million years ago and continued into the Holocene . Postglacial volcanic activity has included eruptions with simultaneous explosive and effusive components , and volcanic rocks in the field vary from basalt over andesite and dacite to rhyolite . The field was a source of obsidian with regional importance . Between 2004 and 2007 , ground inflation began in the volcanic field , indicating the intrusion of a sill beneath it . The rate of inflation is faster than those measured on other inflating volcanoes such as Uturunku in Bolivia and Yellowstone in the United States and has been accompanied by anomalies in soil gas emission and seismic activity .",

Sierra Nevada and Llaima are their neighbors to the south . The snow-capped volcano lies within the protected area Malalcahuello-Nalcas . The volcano 's last eruption began on December 25 , 1988 , earning it the nickname Navidad . The eruption lasted for 13 months before ending in 1990 . The Volcanic Explositivy Index was 3 , indicating tropospheric injections and catastrophic damage . The eruption was from a flank vent and involved mostly andesite lava , and had been preceded by increased seismicity for three weeks . The volume of the lava flow decreased as time went on and the vent dimensions decreased , though by the end of the eruption the andesite had still built up to a length of 10.2 km . There was only a single fatality for the duration of the eruption , but it caused the evacuation of over 2000 people and caused extensive damage to farming and livestock in the surrounding region . Research that models the internal architecture of the volcano indicate that Lonquimay has reached its maximum height and that any large eruption of lava will likely occur from flank vents and not from the summit .",
