The new organisation was known as the World Darts Council ( WDC ) . The WDC would later become the Professional Darts Corporation ( PDC ) . The WDC decided to introduce their own separate World Championship , with the inaugural tournament being staged before the BDO version . The 1994 Championship started on Boxing Day 1993 , and finished on 2 January 1994 . This started a tradition for the WDC/PDC World Championship to kick off before the new calendar year begins . The tournament was staged at the Circus Tavern , Purfleet , Essex . Dennis Priestley became the first WDC World Darts Champion , winning the final 6-1 against Phil Taylor to add to his 6-0 whitewash victory over Eric Bristow in the 1991 World Championship . 1994 was the last time that Phil Taylor would fail to win the World Championship until 2003 .",

He was also the first person to hit two nine-dart finishes in the same match . Taylor played in competitions organised by the British Darts Organisation ( BDO ) until 1993 .
