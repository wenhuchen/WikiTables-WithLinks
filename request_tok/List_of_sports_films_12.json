  "/wiki/Sequel": "A sequel is a work of literature , film , theatre , television , music or video game that continues the story of , or expands upon , some earlier work . In the common context of a narrative work of fiction , a sequel portrays events set in the same fictional universe as an earlier work , usually chronologically following the events of that work . In many cases , the sequel continues elements of the original story , often with the same characters and settings . A sequel can lead to a series , in which key elements appear repeatedly . Although the difference between more than one sequel and a series is somewhat arbitrary , it is clear that some media franchises have enough sequels to become a series , whether originally planned as such or not . [ citation needed ] Sequels are attractive to creators and to publishers because there is less risk involved in returning to a story with known popularity rather than developing new and untested characters and settings . Audiences are sometimes eager for more stories about popular characters or settings , making the production of sequels financially appealing . In movies , sequels are very common . There are many name formats for sequels . Sometimes , they either have unrelated titles or have a letter added on the end . More commonly , they have numbers at the end or have added words on the end . [ citation needed ] It is also common for a sequel to have a variation of the original title or have a subtitle .",
