Audio is from BBC and Imperial War Museum ( IWM ) interviews of British servicemen who fought in the conflict .

Jackson , whose grandfather ( to whom the film is dedicated ) fought in the war , intended for the film to be an immersive experience of what it was like to be a soldier rather than a story or a recount of events . The crew reviewed 600 hours of interviews from 200 veterans and 100 hours of original film footage to make the film .
