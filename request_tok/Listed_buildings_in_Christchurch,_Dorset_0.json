  "/wiki/Monastery": "A monastery is a building or complex of buildings comprising the domestic quarters and workplaces of monastics , monks or nuns , whether living in communities or alone ( hermits ) . A monastery generally includes a place reserved for prayer which may be a chapel , church , or temple , and may also serve as an oratory , or in the case of communities anything from a single building housing only one senior and two or three junior monks or nuns , to vast complexes and estates housing tens or hundreds . A monastery complex typically comprises a number of buildings which include a church , dormitory , cloister , refectory , library , balneary and infirmary . Depending on the location , the monastic order and the occupation of its inhabitants , the complex may also include a wide range of buildings that facilitate self-sufficiency and service to the community . These may include a hospice , a school , and a range of agricultural and manufacturing buildings such as a barn , a forge , or a brewery . In English usage , the term monastery is generally used to denote the buildings of a community of monks . In modern usage , convent tends to be applied only to institutions of female monastics ( nuns ) , particularly communities of teaching or nursing religious sisters . Historically , a convent denoted a house of friars ( reflecting the Latin ) , now more commonly called a friary . Various religions may apply these terms in more specific ways .",
  "/wiki/Henry_VIII": "Henry VIII ( 28 June 1491 - 28 January 1547 ) was King of England from 1509 until his death in 1547 . He was the second Tudor monarch , succeeding his father Henry VII . Henry is best known for his six marriages , in particular his efforts to have his first marriage ( to Catherine of Aragon ) annulled . His disagreement with the Pope on the question of such an annulment led Henry to initiate the English Reformation , separating the Church of England from papal authority . He appointed himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England and dissolved convents and monasteries , for which he was excommunicated . Henry is also known as the father of the Royal Navy , as he invested heavily in the navy , increasing its size from a few to more than 50 ships , and established the Navy Board . Domestically , Henry is known for his radical changes to the English Constitution , ushering in the theory of the divine right of kings . He also greatly expanded royal power during his reign . He frequently used charges of treason and heresy to quell dissent , and those accused were often executed without a formal trial by means of bills of attainder . He achieved many of his political aims through the work of his chief ministers , some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour . Thomas Wolsey , Thomas More , Thomas Cromwell , Richard Rich , and Thomas Cranmer all figured prominently in his administration . Henry was an extravagant spender , using the proceeds from the dissolution of the monasteries and acts of the Reformation Parliament .",
  "/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_monasteries": "The Dissolution of the Monasteries , sometimes referred to as the Suppression of the Monasteries , was the set of administrative and legal processes between 1536 and 1541 by which Henry VIII disbanded monasteries , priories , convents and friaries , in England , Wales and Ireland , appropriated their income , disposed of their assets , and provided for their former personnel and functions . Although the policy was originally envisaged as increasing the regular income of the Crown , much former monastic property was sold off to fund Henry 's military campaigns in the 1540s . He was given the authority to do this in England and Wales by the Act of Supremacy , passed by Parliament in 1534 , which made him Supreme Head of the Church in England , thus separating England from Papal authority , and by the First Suppression Act ( 1535 ) and the Second Suppression Act ( 1539 ) . Professor George W. Bernard argues :",
  "/wiki/Nave": "The nave /ne\u026av/ is the central part of a church , stretching from the ( normally western ) main entrance or rear wall , to the transepts , or in a church without transepts , to the chancel . When a church contains side aisles , as in a basilica-type building , the strict definition of the term nave is restricted to the central aisle . In a broader , more colloquial sense , the nave includes all areas available for the lay worshippers , including the side-aisles and transepts . Either way , the nave is distinct from the area reserved for the choir and clergy .",
  "/wiki/Transepts": "A transept ( with two semitransepts ) is a transverse part of any building , which lies across the main body of the edifice . In churches , a transept is an area set crosswise to the nave in a cruciform ( cross-shaped ) building within the Romanesque and Gothic Christian church architectural traditions . Each half of a transept is known as a semitransept .",
  "/wiki/Perpendicular_Period": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls .",
  "/wiki/Choir_(architecture)": "A choir , also sometimes called quire , is the area of a church or cathedral that provides seating for the clergy and church choir . It is in the western part of the chancel , between the nave and the sanctuary , which houses the altar and Church tabernacle . In larger medieval churches it contained choir-stalls , seating aligned with the side of the church , so at right-angles to the seating for the congregation in the nave . Smaller medieval churches may not have a choir in the architectural sense at all , and they are often lacking in churches built by all denominations after the Protestant Reformation , though the Gothic Revival revived them as a distinct feature . As an architectural term choir remains distinct from the actual location of any singing choir - these may located in various places , and often sing from a choir-loft , often over the door at the liturgical western end . In modern churches , the choir may be located centrally behind the altar , or the pulpit . The back-choir or retroquire is a space behind the high altar in the choir of a church , in which there may be a small altar standing back to back with the other .",
  "/wiki/Christchurch,_Dorset": "Christchurch ( /\u02c8kra\u026ast\u0283\u025c\u02d0rt\u0283/ ) is a town , civil parish and former borough now in the Bournemouth , Christchurch and Poole unitary authority , on the south coast of England . The town adjoins Bournemouth in the west and the New Forest lies to the east . Historically in the county of Hampshire , it became part of the administrative county of Dorset in the 1974 reorganisation of local government . Covering an area of 19.5 square miles ( 51 km2 ) , Christchurch had a 2013 population of 48,368 , making it the fourth-most populous town in Dorset , close behind Weymouth which has a population of 54,539 . Founded in the seventh century at the confluence of the rivers Avon and Stour which flow into Christchurch Harbour , the town was originally named Twynham but became known as Christchurch following the construction of the priory in 1094 . The town developed into an important trading port , and was fortified in the 9th century . Further defences were added in the 12th century with the construction of a castle , which was destroyed during the English Civil War by the Parliamentarian Army . During the 18th and 19th centuries smuggling flourished in Christchurch and became one of the town 's most lucrative industries . The town was heavily fortified during the Second World War as a precaution against an expected invasion and in 1940 an Airspeed factory was established on the town 's airfield which manufactured aircraft for the Royal Air Force . The town 's harbour , beaches , nature reserves and historically important buildings have made Christchurch a popular tourist destination attracting some 1.5 million visitors a year . Bournemouth Airport , an international airport which handles approximately 800,000 passengers a year , was located within the borough boundary at Hurn . The airport 's industrial park contains a number of aerospace and engineering businesses and is one of the largest employment sites in Dorset .",

It is a Norman motte and bailey castle . The castle 's site is inside the old Saxon burh dominating the River Avon 's lowest crossing . The Constable 's House standing adjacent to the castle was added at around 1160 and is a rare and notable example of a Norman domestic dwelling . Today the bailey is home to a bowling green and gardens , and the ditch has been filled but parts of the keep and much of the constable 's house still stand .

  "/wiki/Motte_and_bailey": "A motte and bailey castle is a fortification with a wooden or stone keep situated on a raised area of ground called a motte , accompanied by an enclosed courtyard , or bailey , surrounded by a protective ditch and palisade . Relatively easy to build with unskilled labour , but still militarily formidable , these castles were built across northern Europe from the 10th century onwards , spreading from Normandy and Anjou in France , into the Holy Roman Empire in the 11th century . The Normans introduced the design into England and Wales following their invasion in 1066 . Motte-and-bailey castles were adopted in Scotland , Ireland , the Low Countries and Denmark in the 12th and 13th centuries . Windsor Castle , in England , is an example of a motte-and-bailey castle . By the end of the 13th century , the design was largely superseded by alternative forms of fortification , but the earthworks remain a prominent feature in many countries .",
  "/wiki/Normans": "The Normans ( Norman : Normaunds ; French : Normands ; Latin : Nortmanni/Normanni ; Old Norse : Nor\u00f0ma\u00f0r ) are an ethnic group that arose from contact between Norse Viking settlers of a region in France , named Normandy after them , and indigenous Franks and Gallo-Romans . The settlements in France followed a series of raids on the French coast from mainly Norway , but also Denmark , and Iceland , and they gained political legitimacy when the Viking leader Rollo agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia . The distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the Normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century , and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries . The Norman dynasty had a major political , cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and the Near East . The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Catholic piety , becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy of the Romance community into which they assimilated . They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled , their dialect becoming known as Norman , Normaund or Norman French , an important literary language which is still spoken today in parts of Normandy and the nearby Channel Islands . The Duchy of Normandy , which they formed by treaty with the French crown , was a great fief of medieval France , and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure . The Normans are noted both for their culture , such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions , and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations . Norman adventurers played a role in founding the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after briefly conquering southern Italy and Malta from the Saracens and Byzantines , during an expedition on behalf of their duke , William the Conqueror , which also led to the Norman conquest of England at the historic Battle of Hastings in 1066 . Norman and Anglo-Norman forces contributed to the Iberian Reconquista from the early eleventh to the mid-thirteenth centuries . Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East , where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant , to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain , to Ireland , and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands . The legacy of the Normans persists today through the regional languages and dialects of France , England , Spain , and Sicily , as well as the various cultural , judicial , and political arrangements they introduced in their conquered territories .",
  "/wiki/Aethelwold_of_Wessex": "\u00c6thelwold ( /\u02c8\u00e6\u03b8\u0259lwo\u028ald/ ) or \u00c6thelwald ( died 902 or 903 ) [ a ] was the younger of two known sons of \u00c6thelred I , King of Wessex from 865 to 871 . \u00c6thelwold and his brother \u00c6thelhelm were still infants when their father the king died while fighting a Danish Viking invasion . The throne passed to the king 's younger brother ( \u00c6thelwold 's uncle ) Alfred the Great , who carried on the war against the Vikings and won a crucial victory at the Battle of Edington in 878 . After Alfred 's death in 899 , \u00c6thelwold disputed the throne with Alfred 's son , Edward the Elder . As senior \u00e6theling ( prince of the royal dynasty eligible for kingship ) , \u00c6thelwold had a strong claim to the throne . He attempted to raise an army to support his claim , but was unable to get sufficient support to meet Edward in battle and fled to Viking-controlled Northumbria , where he was accepted as king . In 901 or 902 he sailed with a fleet to Essex , where he was also accepted as king . The following year \u00c6thelwold persuaded the East Anglian Danes to attack Edward 's territory in Wessex and Mercia . Edward retaliated with a raid on East Anglia , and when he withdrew the men of Kent lingered and met the East Anglian Danes at the Battle of the Holme . The Danes were victorious but suffered heavy losses , including the death of \u00c6thelwold , which ended the challenge to Edward 's rule .",
  "/wiki/Edward_the_Elder": "Edward the Elder ( c. 874 - 17 July 924 ) was King of the Anglo-Saxons from 899 until his death . He was the elder son of Alfred the Great and his wife Ealhswith . When Edward succeeded to the throne , he had to defeat a challenge from his cousin \u00c6thelwold , who had a strong claim to the throne as the son of Alfred 's elder brother and predecessor , \u00c6thelred . Alfred had succeeded \u00c6thelred as king of Wessex in 871 , and almost faced defeat against the Danish Vikings until his decisive victory at the Battle of Edington in 878 . After the battle , the Vikings still ruled Northumbria , East Anglia and eastern Mercia , leaving only Wessex and western Mercia under Anglo-Saxon control . In the early 880s \u00c6thelred , Lord of the Mercians , the ruler of western Mercia , accepted Alfred 's lordship and married his daughter \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d , and around 886 Alfred adopted the new title King of the Anglo-Saxons as the ruler of all Anglo-Saxons not subject to Danish rule . In 910 a Mercian and West Saxon army inflicted a decisive defeat on an invading Northumbrian army , ending the threat from the northern Vikings . In the 910s , Edward conquered Viking-ruled southern England in partnership with his sister \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d , who had succeeded as Lady of the Mercians following the death of her husband in 911 . Historians dispute how far Mercia was dominated by Wessex during this period , and after \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d 's death in June 918 , her daughter \u00c6lfwynn , briefly became second Lady of the Mercians , but in December Edward took her into Wessex and imposed direct rule on Mercia . By the end of the 910s he ruled Wessex , Mercia and East Anglia , and only Northumbria remained under Viking rule . In 924 he faced a Mercian and Welsh revolt at Chester , and after putting it down he died at Farndon in Cheshire on 17 July 924 . He was succeeded by his eldest son \u00c6thelstan .",
  "/wiki/Norman_conquest": "The Norman conquest of England ( in Britain , often called the Norman Conquest or the Conquest ) was the 11th-century invasion and occupation of England by an army of Norman , Breton , Flemish , and French soldiers led by the Duke of Normandy , later styled William the Conqueror . William 's claim to the English throne derived from his familial relationship with the childless Anglo-Saxon king Edward the Confessor , who may have encouraged William 's hopes for the throne . Edward died in January 1066 and was succeeded by his brother-in-law Harold Godwinson . The Norwegian king Harald Hardrada invaded northern England in September 1066 and was victorious at the Battle of Fulford , but Godwinson 's army defeated and killed Hardrada at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September . Within days , William landed in southern England . Harold marched south to oppose him , leaving a significant portion of his army in the north . Harold 's army confronted William 's invaders on 14 October at the Battle of Hastings ; William 's force defeated Harold , who was killed in the engagement . Although William 's main rivals were gone , he still faced rebellions over the following years and was not secure on his throne until after 1072 . The lands of the resisting English elite were confiscated ; some of the elite fled into exile . To control his new kingdom , William granted lands to his followers and built castles commanding military strongpoints throughout the land with the Domesday Book , a manuscript record of the Great Survey of much of England and parts of Wales being completed by 1086 . Other effects of the conquest included the court and government , the introduction of the Norman language as the language of the elites , and changes in the composition of the upper classes , as William enfeoffed lands to be held directly from the king . More gradual changes affected the agricultural classes and village life : the main change appears to have been the formal elimination of slavery , which may or may not have been linked to the invasion .",

  "/wiki/Ashlar": "Ashlar ( /\u02c8\u00e6\u0283l\u0259r/ ) is finely dressed ( cut , worked ) stone , either an individual stone that was worked until squared or the structure built from it . Ashlar is the finest stone masonry unit , generally rectangular cuboid , mentioned by Vitruvius as opus isodomum , or less frequently trapezoidal . Precisely cut on all faces adjacent to those of other stones , ashlar is capable of very thin joints between blocks , and the visible face of the stone may be quarry-faced or feature a variety of treatments : tooled , smoothly polished or rendered with another material for decorative effect . One such decorative treatment consists of small grooves achieved by the application of a metal comb . Generally used only on softer stone ashlar , this decoration is known as mason 's drag . Ashlar is in contrast to rubble masonry , which employs irregularly shaped stones , sometimes minimally worked or selected for similar size , or both . Ashlar is related but distinct from other stone masonry that is finely dressed but not quadrilateral , such as curvilinear and polygonal masonry . Ashlar may be coursed , which involves lengthy horizontals layers of stone blocks laid in parallel , and therefore with continuous horizontal joints . Ashlar may also be random , which involves stone blocks laid with deliberately discontinuous courses and therefore discontinuous joints both vertically and horizontally . In either case , it generally uses a joining material such as mortar to bind the blocks together , although dry ashlar construction , metal ties , and other methods of assembly have been used . The dry ashlar of Inca architecture in Cusco and Machu Picchu is particularly fine and famous .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

  "/wiki/Watermill": "A watermill or water mill is a mill that uses hydropower . It is a structure that uses a water wheel or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling ( grinding ) , rolling , or hammering . Such processes are needed in the production of many material goods , including flour , lumber , paper , textiles , and many metal products . These watermills may comprise gristmills , sawmills , paper mills , textile mills , hammermills , trip hammering mills , rolling mills , wire drawing mills . One major way to classify watermills is by wheel orientation ( vertical or horizontal ) , one powered by a vertical waterwheel through a gear mechanism , and the other equipped with a horizontal waterwheel without such a mechanism . The former type can be further divided , depending on where the water hits the wheel paddles , into undershot , overshot , breastshot and pitchback ( backshot or reverse shot ) waterwheel mills . Another way to classify water mills is by an essential trait about their location : tide mills use the movement of the tide ; ship mills are water mills onboard ( and constituting ) a ship . Watermills impact the river dynamics of the watercourses where they are installed . During the time watermills operate channels tend to sedimentate , particularly backwater . Also in the backwater area , inundation events and sedimentation of adjacent floodplains increase . Over time however these effects are cancelled by river banks becoming higher . Where mills have been removed , river incision increases and channels deepen .",
  "/wiki/Workhouse": "In England and Wales , a workhouse ( Welsh : tloty ) was a total institution where those unable to support themselves were offered accommodation and employment . ( In Scotland , they were usually known as poorhouses . ) The earliest known use of the term workhouse is from 1631 , in an account by the mayor of Abingdon reporting that wee haue erected wthn our borough a workehouse to sett poore people to worke . The origins of the workhouse can be traced to the Poor Law Act of 1388 , which attempted to address the labour shortages following the Black Death in England by restricting the movement of labourers , and ultimately led to the state becoming responsible for the support of the poor . However , mass unemployment following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 , the introduction of new technology to replace agricultural workers in particular , and a series of bad harvests , meant that by the early 1830s the established system of poor relief was proving to be unsustainable . The New Poor Law of 1834 attempted to reverse the economic trend by discouraging the provision of relief to anyone who refused to enter a workhouse . Some Poor Law authorities hoped to run workhouses at a profit by utilising the free labour of their inmates , who generally lacked the skills or motivation to compete in the open market [ citation needed ] . Most were employed on tasks such as breaking stones , crushing bones to produce fertiliser , or picking oakum using a large metal nail known as a spike , perhaps the origin of the nickname the spike for a workhouse . As the 19th century wore on , workhouses increasingly became refuges for the elderly , infirm and sick rather than the able-bodied poor , and in 1929 legislation was passed to allow local authorities to take over workhouse infirmaries as municipal hospitals . Although workhouses were formally abolished by the same legislation in 1930 , many continued under their new appellation of Public Assistance Institutions under the control of local authorities . It was not until the National Assistance Act of 1948 that the last vestiges of the Poor Law disappeared , and with them the workhouses .",

However , other European languages , notably including Italian , do not have the same distinction ; stucco means plaster in Italian and serves for both . This has led to English-speakers sometimes using stucco for interior decorative plasterwork in relief .",
  "/wiki/Doric_order": "The Doric order was one of the three orders of ancient Greek and later Roman architecture ; the other two canonical orders were the Ionic and the Corinthian . The Doric is most easily recognized by the simple circular capitals at the top of columns . Originating in the western Dorian region of Greece , it is the earliest and in its essence the simplest of the orders , though still with complex details in the entablature above . The Greek Doric column was fluted or smooth-surfaced , and had no base , dropping straight into the stylobate or platform on which the temple or other building stood . The capital was a simple circular form , with some mouldings , under a square cushion that is very wide in early versions , but later more restrained . Above a plain architrave , the complexity comes in the frieze , where the two features originally unique to the Doric , the triglyph and guttae , are skeuomorphic memories of the beams and retaining pegs of the wooden constructions that preceded stone Doric temples . In stone they are purely ornamental . The relatively uncommon Roman and Renaissance Doric retained these , and often introduced thin layers of moulding or further ornament , as well as often using plain columns . More often they used versions of the Tuscan order , elaborated for nationalistic reasons by Italian Renaissance writers , which is in effect a simplified Doric , with un-fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae . The Doric order was much used in Greek Revival architecture from the 18th century onwards ; often earlier Greek versions were used , with wider columns and no bases to them . Since at least Vitruvius , it has been customary for writers to associate the Doric with masculine virtues ( the Ionic representing the feminine ) . It is also normally the cheapest of the orders to use .",
  "/wiki/Triglyph": "Triglyph is an architectural term for the vertically channeled tablets of the Doric frieze in classical architecture , so called because of the angular channels in them . The rectangular recessed spaces between the triglyphs on a Doric frieze are called metopes . The raised spaces between the channels themselves ( within a triglyph ) are called femur in Latin or meros in Greek . In the strict tradition of classical architecture , a set of guttae , the six triangular pegs below , always go with a triglyph above ( and vice versa ) , and the pair of features are only found in entablatures of buildings using the Doric order . The absence of the pair effectively converts a building from being in the Doric order to being in the Tuscan order . The triglyph is largely thought to be a tectonic and skeuomorphic representation in stone of the wooden beam ends of the typical primitive hut , as described by Vitruvius and Renaissance writers . The wooden beams were notched in three separate places in order to cast their rough-cut ends mostly in shadow . Greek architecture ( and later Roman architecture ) preserved this feature , as well as many other features common in original wooden buildings , as a tribute to the origins of architecture and its role in the history and development of man . The channels could also have a function in channeling rainwater . [ citation needed ] [ original research ? ]",

The toponymy of Burton suggests an Anglo-Saxon settlement but the first record of the name appears in twelfth-century records . It is thought that this is because it has always been viewed as an extension of Christchurch . Certainly , there is evidence of human habitation there as far back as the mesolithic . The oldest existing parts date back to at least the early 18th century . Greatly expanded in the 1970s , today the population is around 4000 , residing in more than 1700 dwellings which extend to within 3\u20444 mile ( 1.2 km ) of the Christchurch urban area . Burton has a much younger age demographic than the rest of Christchurch and the vast majority of the inhabitants identify as White British . More than 30% of villagers are non-religious but those who are , are mainly Christian . The village holds a number of annual events including a veteran 's day and an Easter egg hunt . Church services are also held on the green at Easter and Christmas including carols around the tree . There are a number of listed buildings in the village including the parish church of St Luke , built in 1874-75 and designed by Benjamin Ferrey , and Burton Hall , a large 18th-century residence with grade II* status .",
  "/wiki/Window_tax": "Window tax was a property tax based on the number of windows in a house . It was a significant social , cultural , and architectural force in England , France , Ireland and Scotland during the 18th and 19th centuries . To avoid the tax some houses from the period can be seen to have bricked-up window-spaces ( ready to be glazed or reglazed at a later date ) . In England and Wales it was introduced in 1696 and was repealed in 1851 , 156 years after first being introduced . France ( established 1798 , repealed 1926 ) and Scotland both had window taxes for similar reasons .",
  "/wiki/Mayor": "In many countries , a mayor is the highest-ranking official in a municipal government such as that of a city or a town . Worldwide , there is a wide variance in local laws and customs regarding the powers and responsibilities of a mayor as well as the means by which a mayor is elected or otherwise mandated . Depending on the system chosen , a mayor may be the chief executive officer of the municipal government , may simply chair a multi-member governing body with little or no independent power , or may play a solely ceremonial role . Options for selection of a mayor include direct election by the public , or selection by an elected governing council or board .",
  "/wiki/Smugglers": "Smuggling is the illegal transportation of objects , substances , information or people , such as out of a house or buildings , into a prison , or across an international border , in violation of applicable laws or other regulations . There are various motivations to smuggle . These include the participation in illegal trade , such as in the drug trade , illegal weapons trade , exotic wildlife trade , illegal immigration or illegal emigration , tax evasion , providing contraband to a prison inmate , or the theft of the items being smuggled . Smuggling is a common theme in literature , from Bizet 's opera Carmen to the James Bond spy books ( and later films ) Diamonds are Forever and Goldfinger .",
  "/wiki/Coaching_inn": "The coaching inn ( also coaching house or staging inn ) was a vital part of Europe 's inland transport infrastructure until the development of the railway , providing a resting point for people and horses . The inn served the needs of travellers , for food , drink , and rest . The attached stables , staffed by hostlers , cared for the horses , including changing a tired team for a fresh one . Coaching inns were used by private travellers in their coaches , the public riding stagecoaches between one town and another , and ( in England at least ) the mail coach . Just as with roadhouses in other countries , although many survive , and some still offer overnight accommodation , in general coaching inns have lost their original function and now operate as ordinary pubs .",
  "/wiki/Thatched": "Thatching is the craft of building a roof with dry vegetation such as straw , water reed , sedge ( Cladium mariscus ) , rushes , heather , or palm branches , layering the vegetation so as to shed water away from the inner roof . Since the bulk of the vegetation stays dry and is densely packed - trapping air - thatching also functions as insulation . It is a very old roofing method and has been used in both tropical and temperate climates . Thatch is still employed by builders in developing countries , usually with low-cost local vegetation . By contrast , in some developed countries it is the choice of some affluent people who desire a rustic look for their home , would like a more ecologically friendly roof , or who have purchased an originally thatched abode .",
  "/wiki/British_Museum": "The British Museum , in the Bloomsbury area of London , United Kingdom , is a public institution dedicated to human history , art and culture . Its permanent collection of some eight million works is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence , having been widely sourced during the era of the British Empire . It documents the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present . [ a ] It was the first public national museum in the world . The British Museum was established in 1753 , largely based on the collections of the Irish physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane . It first opened to the public in 1759 , in Montagu House , on the site of the current building . Its expansion over the following 250 years was largely a result of expanding British colonisation and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions , the first being the Natural History Museum in 1881 . In 1973 , the British Library Act 1972 detached the library department from the British Museum , but it continued to host the now separated British Library in the same Reading Room and building as the museum until 1997 . The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital , Culture , Media and Sport , and as with all national museums in the UK it charges no admission fee , except for loan exhibitions . Its ownership of some of its most famous objects originating in other countries is disputed and remains the subject of international controversy , most notably in the case of the Parthenon Marbles .",
  "/wiki/Bank_of_England": "The Bank of England is the central bank of the United Kingdom and the model on which most modern central banks have been based . Established in 1694 to act as the English Government 's banker , and still one of the bankers for the Government of the United Kingdom , it is the world 's eighth-oldest bank . It was privately owned by stockholders from its foundation in 1694 until it was nationalised in 1946 . The Bank became an independent public organisation in 1998 , wholly owned by the Treasury Solicitor on behalf of the government , but with independence in setting monetary policy . The Bank is one of eight banks authorised to issue banknotes in the United Kingdom , has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in England and Wales and regulates the issue of banknotes by commercial banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland . The Bank 's Monetary Policy Committee has a devolved responsibility for managing monetary policy . The Treasury has reserve powers to give orders to the committee if they are required in the public interest and by extreme economic circumstances , but such orders must be endorsed by Parliament within 28 days . The Bank 's Financial Policy Committee held its first meeting in June 2011 as a macroprudential regulator to oversee regulation of the UK 's financial sector . The Bank 's headquarters have been in London 's main financial district , the City of London , on Threadneedle Street , since 1734 . It is sometimes known as The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street , a name taken from a satirical cartoon by James Gillray in 1797 . The road junction outside is known as Bank junction . As a regulator and central bank , the Bank of England has not offered consumer banking services for many years , but it still does manage some public-facing services such as exchanging superseded bank notes .",
  "/wiki/King_Louis-Philippe": "Louis Philippe I ( 6 October 1773 - 26 August 1850 ) was King of the French from 1830 to 1848 . As Duke of Chartres he distinguished himself commanding troops during the Revolutionary Wars but broke with the Republic over its decision to execute King Louis XVI . He fled to Switzerland in 1793 after being connected with a plot to restore France 's monarchy . His father Louis Philippe II , Duke of Orl\u00e9ans ( Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9 ) fell under suspicion and was executed , and Louis Philippe remained in exile for 21 years until the Bourbon Restoration . He was proclaimed king in 1830 after his cousin Charles X was forced to abdicate by the July Revolution . The reign of Louis Philippe is known as the July Monarchy and was dominated by wealthy industrialists and bankers . He followed conservative policies , especially under the influence of French statesman Fran\u00e7ois Guizot during the period 1840-48 . He also promoted friendship with Britain and sponsored colonial expansion , notably the French conquest of Algeria . His popularity faded as economic conditions in France deteriorated in 1847 , and he was forced to abdicate after the outbreak of the French Revolution of 1848 . He lived out his life in exile in the United Kingdom . His supporters were known as Orl\u00e9anists , as opposed to Legitimists who supported the main line of the House of Bourbon .",
  "/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars": "The Napoleonic Wars ( 1803-1815 ) were a series of major conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies , led by Napoleon I , against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions , financed and usually led by the United Kingdom . The wars stemmed from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and its resultant conflict . The wars are often categorised into five conflicts , each termed after the coalition that fought Napoleon : the Third Coalition ( 1805 ) , the Fourth ( 1806-07 ) , the Fifth ( 1809 ) , the Sixth ( 1813 ) , and the Seventh ( 1815 ) . Napoleon , upon ascending to First Consul of France in 1799 , had inherited a chaotic republic ; he subsequently created a state with stable finances , a strong bureaucracy , and a well-trained army . In 1805 , Austria and Russia started the Third Coalition and waged war against France . In response , Napoleon defeated the allied Russo-Austrian army at Austerlitz in December 1805 , which is considered his greatest victory . At sea , the British severely defeated the joint Franco-Spanish navy in the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805 . This victory secured British control of the seas and prevented the invasion of Britain itself . Concerned about increasing French power , Prussia led the creation of the Fourth Coalition with Russia , Saxony and Sweden , and the resumption of war in October 1806 . Napoleon quickly defeated the Prussians in Jena and the Russians in Friedland , bringing an uneasy peace to the continent . The peace failed , though , as war broke out in 1809 , when the badly prepared Fifth Coalition , led by Austria , was quickly defeated in Wagram . Hoping to isolate Britain economically , Napoleon launched an invasion of Portugal , the only remaining British ally in continental Europe ."
