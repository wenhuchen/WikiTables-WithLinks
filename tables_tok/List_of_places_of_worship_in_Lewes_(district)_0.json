  "intro": "There are 69 extant churches and places of worship in the district of Lewes, one of five local government districts in the English county of East Sussex. A further 17 former places of worship are no longer in religious use. The area now covered by the district is mainly rural and characterised by small villages with ancient parish churches. The riverside market town of Lewes, the port of Newhaven and the seaside towns of Seaford, Peacehaven and Telscombe Cliffs are the main urban areas and have higher concentrations of religious buildings. Most residents of the district identify themselves as Christian, and there are no places of worship serving any other religious groups. Many Christian denominations are represented - the town of Lewes in particular has a long-established history of Protestant Nonconformism - but the majority of churches serve the Church of England community. English Heritage has awarded listed status to many of Lewes district's places of worship. A building is defined as listed when it is placed on a statutory register of buildings of special architectural or historic interest in accordance with the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport, a Government department, is responsible for this; English Heritage, a non-departmental public body, acts as an agency of the department to administer the process and advise the department on relevant issues. There are three grades of listing status. Grade I, the highest, is defined as being of exceptional interest; Grade II* is used for particularly important buildings of more than special interest; and Grade II, the lowest, is used for buildings of special interest."
