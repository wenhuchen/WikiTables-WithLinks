  "/wiki/PHP": "PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development . It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 ; the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group . PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page , but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP : Hypertext Preprocessor . PHP code may be executed with a command line interface ( CLI ) , embedded into HTML code , or used in combination with various web template systems , web content management systems , and web frameworks . PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in a web server or as a Common Gateway Interface ( CGI ) executable . The web server outputs the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code , which may be any type of data , such as generated HTML code or binary image data . PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context , such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control . The standard PHP interpreter , powered by the Zend Engine , is free software released under the PHP License . PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform , free of charge . The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014 , with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow . Since 2014 , work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification . As of February 2020 [ update ] , over half of sites on the web using PHP are still on discontinued/EOLed version 5.6 or older ; and over 55% of all websites in the world run versions prior to 7.2 , that are neither officially supported by The PHP Development Team , while security support is provided by third parties , such as Debian ( up to June 2020 for PHP 5 ) .",

Its name is a combination of My , the name of co-founder Michael Widenius 's daughter , and SQL , the abbreviation for Structured Query Language . MySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License , and is also available under a variety of proprietary licenses . MySQL was owned and sponsored by the Swedish company MySQL AB , which was bought by Sun Microsystems ( now Oracle Corporation ) . In 2010 , when Oracle acquired Sun , Widenius forked the open-source MySQL project to create MariaDB . MySQL is a component of the LAMP web application software stack ( and others ) , which is an acronym for Linux , Apache , MySQL , Perl/PHP/Python . MySQL is used by many database-driven web applications , including Drupal , Joomla , phpBB , and WordPress . MySQL is also used by many popular websites , including Facebook , Flickr , MediaWiki , Twitter , and YouTube .",

In contrast to many other database management systems , SQLite is not a client-server database engine . Rather , it is embedded into the end program . SQLite is ACID-compliant and implements most of the SQL standard , generally following PostgreSQL syntax . However , SQLite uses a dynamically and weakly typed SQL syntax that does not guarantee the domain integrity . This means that one can , for example , insert a string into a column defined as an integer . SQLite will attempt to convert data between formats where appropriate , the string 123 into an integer in this case , but does not guarantee such conversions , and will store the data as-is if such a conversion is not possible . SQLite is a popular choice as embedded database software for local/client storage in application software such as web browsers . It is arguably the most widely deployed database engine , as it is used today by several widespread browsers , operating systems , and embedded systems ( such as mobile phones ) , among others . SQLite has bindings to many programming languages .",

To highlight the software 's ability to manage many types of content , its blogs were renamed to collections . b2evolution 5.0 was rapidly adopted , becoming the most popular version , but overall b2evolution usage is declining relative to competitors WordPress and Drupal .

The standard release of Drupal , known as Drupal core , contains basic features common to content-management systems . These include user account registration and maintenance , menu management , RSS feeds , taxonomy , page layout customization , and system administration . The Drupal core installation can serve as a simple website , a single- or multi-user blog , an Internet forum , or a community website providing for user-generated content .
