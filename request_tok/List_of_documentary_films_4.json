He is frequently cited as one of the most influential filmmakers in cinematic history . His films , which are mostly adaptations of novels or short stories , cover a wide range of genres , and are noted for their realism , dark humor , unique cinematography , extensive set designs , and evocative use of music . Kubrick was raised in the Bronx , New York City , and attended William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945 . He received average grades , but displayed a keen interest in literature , photography , and film from a young age , and taught himself all aspects of film production and directing after graduating from high school . After working as a photographer for Look magazine in the late 1940s and early 1950s , he began making short films on a shoestring budget , and made his first major Hollywood film , The Killing , for United Artists in 1956 . This was followed by two collaborations with Kirk Douglas , the war picture Paths of Glory ( 1957 ) and the historical epic Spartacus ( 1960 ) . His reputation as a filmmaker in Hollywood grew , and he was approached by Marlon Brando to film what would become One-Eyed Jacks ( 1961 ) , though Brando eventually decided to direct it himself . Creative differences arising from his work with Douglas and the film studios , a dislike of the Hollywood industry , and a growing concern about crime in America prompted Kubrick to move to the United Kingdom in 1961 , where he spent most of the remainder of his life and career . His home at Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire , which he shared with his wife Christiane , became his workplace , where he did his writing , research , editing , and management of production details . This allowed him to have almost complete artistic control over his films , but with the rare advantage of having financial support from major Hollywood studios . His first productions in Britain were two films with Peter Sellers , Lolita ( 1962 ) and Dr. Strangelove ( 1964 ) .",

  "/wiki/Death_on_the_Rock": "Death on the Rock is a controversial television documentary , an episode of Thames Television 's current affairs series This Week , broadcast in the United Kingdom on ITV on 28 April 1988 . The programme examined the deaths of three Provisional Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) members in Gibraltar on 6 March 1988 at the hands of the British Special Air Service ( codenamed Operation Flavius ) . Death on the Rock presented evidence that the IRA members were shot without warning or while attempting to surrender . It was condemned by the British government , while tabloid newspapers denounced it as sensationalist . Death on the Rock subsequently became the first individual documentary to be the subject of an independent inquiry , in which it was largely vindicated . The project began after it emerged that the three IRA members shot in Gibraltar were found to be unarmed and not in possession of a bomb . The series ' editor , Roger Bolton , dispatched journalists to Gibraltar and Spain , where they interviewed several people who witnessed the shootings as well as Spanish police officers who had been involved in surveillance of the IRA team . The journalists also filmed the funerals of the IRA members in Belfast . Satisfied by the journalists ' findings , Bolton sought a conclusion to the programme ; as the British government refused to comment , Bolton recruited a leading human rights lawyer to give his opinion on the findings . The documentary was broadcast on 28 April 1988 ( just under two months after the shootings ) , despite two attempts by Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe to have the Independent Broadcasting Authority postpone the broadcast . Using the eyewitness statements , the documentary questioned the government 's version of events , and suggested that the three IRA members may have been unlawfully killed . Reporter Julian Manyon summed up the programme 's findings : none of the witnesses interviewed for the programme heard the soldiers challenge the trio before opening fire , but variously believed they had seen the IRA members shot in the back , with their hands up , or after falling to the ground .",
