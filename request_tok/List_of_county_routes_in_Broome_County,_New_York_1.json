  "/wiki/US_11_(NY)": "U.S. Route 11 ( US 11 ) is a part of the U.S. Highway System that runs from New Orleans , Louisiana , to the Canada-US border at Rouses Point , New York . In the state of New York , US 11 extends for 318.66 miles ( 512.83 km ) from the Pennsylvania state line south of the Southern Tier city of Binghamton to the Canada-US border at the North Country village of Rouses Point , where it becomes Route 223 upon entering Quebec . The portion of US 11 south of Watertown follows a mostly north-south alignment and is paralleled by Interstate 81 ( I-81 ) while the part of the route north of Watertown follows a more east-west routing , parallel to but not directly on the St. Lawrence River . The portion of US 11 in New York passes through the central district of four cities : Binghamton , Cortland , Syracuse , and Watertown . East of Watertown , the route traverses mostly rural terrain and serves only small villages , such as Potsdam , Malone , and Champlain . While the portion of US 11 between the Pennsylvania state line and Watertown is merely an alternate route to I-81 , the section east of Watertown is the primary long-distance route across the North Country of New York . US 11 was designated as part of the 1926 establishment of the U.S. Highway System . It was first signed in New York in 1927 , replacing New York State Route 2 ( NY 2 ) , a route assigned three years earlier as part of the creation of the modern New York state route system . The termini of US 11 have more or less remained the same since ; however , multiple realignments have occurred along the points in between . One of US 11 's three suffixed routes , NY 11C , follows a former routing of US 11 .",

The population of the city itself , according to the 2010 census , is 47,376 . From the days of the railroad , Binghamton was a transportation crossroads and a manufacturing center , and has been known at different times for the production of cigars , shoes , and computers . IBM was founded nearby , and the flight simulator was invented in the city , leading to a notable concentration of electronics- and defense-oriented firms . This sustained economic prosperity earned Binghamton the moniker of the Valley of Opportunity . However , following cuts made by defense firms after the end of the Cold War , the region has lost a significant portion of its manufacturing industry . Today , while there is a continued concentration of high-tech firms , Binghamton is emerging as a healthcare- and education-focused city , with the presence of Binghamton University acting as much of the driving force behind this revitalization .",

It is primarily a long shortcut around Binghamton . NY 206 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , but only from Bainbridge to Downsville .
