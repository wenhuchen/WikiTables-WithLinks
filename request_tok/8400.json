  "/wiki/Backusburg_Mounds": "The Backusburg Mounds ( 15-CW-64 ) are an archaeological site in the Jackson Purchase region of the U.S. state of Kentucky . Located near the tiny community of Backusburg in northwestern Calloway County , the mounds are one of the region 's premier archaeological sites . Since at least the early years of the twentieth century , the mounds have been well known locally , due partially to their large size ; the largest mound measures 150 by 75 feet ( 46 m \u00d7 23 m ) at the base . Located on a ridgeline above a fork of the Clarks River , the mound bears a peculiar shape ; its size and shape have caused observers to suggest that it might actually be the remnants of a series of smaller mounds placed next to each other . As late as the 1930s , this largest mound had never been plowed ; it lay in dense woodland , and among the trees growing upon it were some of considerable size . Nevertheless , the mound has not been preserved entirely without damage ; various parts of the mound have been dug into at various times and have yielded numerous artifacts . Such findings are not unprecedented in the area ; a field close to Backusburg has long produced skeletons , projectile points , and pottery when plowed , leading to its identification as a former village site . Archaeologists first learned of the site in the 1920s , but only one scholarly investigation was conducted at the site during the twentieth century ; it was performed largely by a team of students from the nearby Murray State University under the leadership of archaeologist Kenneth Carstens in 1981 . Although Murray State only had one day 's access to the site , the team was able to produce maps of the site that enabled its boundaries to be determined accurately , and the materials they collected from the surface enabled Carstens to study the site 's cultural affiliation ; it has since been determined to be a work of a Mississippian people . Four years later , the mound complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places under its Smithsonian trinomial designation of 15-CW-64 ; it is Calloway County 's only National Register-listed archaeological site and one of thirteen in the Jackson Purchase with this designation . Additional work was finally conducted at Backusburg in mid-2013 , as another team of Murray State archaeology students was assigned to document the site more carefully for their field school . At the same , the property was in the middle of being bought by The Archaeological Conservancy , an organization whose raison d'\u00eatre is purchasing archaeological sites in order to preserve them .",
