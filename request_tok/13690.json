Construction began the same year , and the park 's first areas were opened to the public in late 1858 . Additional land at the northern end of Central Park was purchased in 1859 , and the park was completed in 1876 . After a period of decline in the early 20th century , New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses started a program to clean up Central Park . Another decline in the late 20th century spurred the creation of the Central Park Conservancy in 1980 , which refurbished many parts of the park during the 1980s and 1990s . Main attractions of the park include landscapes such as the Ramble and Lake , Hallett Nature Sanctuary , the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir , and Sheep Meadow ; amusement attractions such as Wollman Rink , Central Park Carousel , and the Central Park Zoo ; formal spaces such as the Central Park Mall and Bethesda Terrace ; and the Delacorte Theater , which hosts Shakespeare in the Park programs in the summertime .
