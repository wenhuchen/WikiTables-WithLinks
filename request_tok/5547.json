  "/wiki/Botan_(programming_library)": "Botan is a BSD-licensed cryptographic library written in C++ . It provides a wide variety of cryptographic algorithms , formats , and protocols , e.g . SSL and TLS . It is used in the Monotone distributed revision control program , the OpenDNSSEC system , and ISC 's Kea DHCP server among other projects . The project was originally called OpenCL , a name now used by Apple Inc. and Khronos Group for a heterogeneous system programming framework . It was renamed Botan in 2002 . In 2007 , the German Federal Office for Information Security contracted FlexSecure GmbH to add an implementation of Card Verifiable Certificates for ePassports to Botan ; the modified version of Botan was released under the name InSiTo . Starting in 2015 , the German Federal Office for Information Security funded a project , which included improving the documentation , test suite and feature set of Botan , culminating in 2017 , when it was evaluated and recommended as a library suitable for applications with increased security requirements .",
  "/wiki/Sqlite": "SQLite ( /\u02cc\u025bs\u02cckju\u02d0\u02cc\u025bl\u02c8a\u026at/ , /\u02c8si\u02d0kw\u0259\u02ccla\u026at/ ) is a relational database management system ( RDBMS ) contained in a C library . In contrast to many other database management systems , SQLite is not a client-server database engine . Rather , it is embedded into the end program . SQLite is ACID-compliant and implements most of the SQL standard , generally following PostgreSQL syntax . However , SQLite uses a dynamically and weakly typed SQL syntax that does not guarantee the domain integrity . This means that one can , for example , insert a string into a column defined as an integer . SQLite will attempt to convert data between formats where appropriate , the string 123 into an integer in this case , but does not guarantee such conversions , and will store the data as-is if such a conversion is not possible . SQLite is a popular choice as embedded database software for local/client storage in application software such as web browsers . It is arguably the most widely deployed database engine , as it is used today by several widespread browsers , operating systems , and embedded systems ( such as mobile phones ) , among others . SQLite has bindings to many programming languages .",
  "/wiki/Zlib": "zlib is a software library used for data compression . zlib was written by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler and is an abstraction of the DEFLATE compression algorithm used in their gzip file compression program . zlib is also a crucial component of many software platforms , including Linux , macOS , and iOS . It has also been used in gaming consoles such as the PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 3 , Wii U , Wii , Xbox One and Xbox 360 . The first public version of zlib , 0.9 , was released on 1 May 1995 and was originally intended for use with the libpng image library . It is free software , distributed under the zlib License .",
  "/wiki/Bzip2": "bzip2 is a free and open-source file compression program that uses the Burrows-Wheeler algorithm . It only compresses single files and is not a file archiver . It is developed by Julian Seward and maintained by Federico Mena . Seward made the first public release of bzip2 , version 0.15 , in July 1996 . The compressor 's stability and popularity grew over the next several years , and Seward released version 1.0 in late 2000 . [ not verified in body ] Following a nine year hiatus of updates for the project since 2010 , on June 4 , 2019 Federico Mena accepted maintainership of the bzip2 project .",
  "/wiki/XZ_Utils": "XZ Utils ( previously LZMA Utils ) is a set of free software command-line lossless data compressors , including LZMA and xz , for Unix-like operating systems and , from version 5.0 onwards , Microsoft Windows . xz achieves higher compression rates than alternatives like gzip and bzip2 . Decompression speed is faster than bzip2 , but slower than gzip . Compression can be much slower than gzip , and is slower than bzip2 for high levels of compression , and is most useful when a compressed file will be used many times . XZ Utils consists of two major components :",
