It had no official post office in 1936 ; an unofficial one operated two days per week offering limited service . The town 's post office was robbed in 1937 , with over \u00a3250 being stolen during the course of the night . The post office was part of the Emu mine premises and it was noted that the safe from which the money was stolen was found locked afterward . At one point the town had a population of 500 . The Agnew Hotel , still in operation [ needs update ] , was built in 1945 amongst a row of shops on the main street and is all that is left of the town today . An old head frame of a stamp mill and the large tailing dumps of the East Murchison United gold mine also remain just outside the town . In 1947 two prospectors , Charles Farranda and Alberto Bernardi , discovered a new gold find north of the Emu mine . The quartz reef containing coarse gold returned about 10oz per ton and was described as the best find in the district for years . The town water supply failed in the same year when , following six days of calm weather , the windmill was unable to pump water from the town bore and most of the town 's tanks had run dry .",
