  "/wiki/U2_3D": "U2 3D is a 2008 American-produced 3D concert film featuring rock band U2 performing during the Vertigo Tour in 2006 . The film contains performances of 14 songs , including tracks from How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb ( 2004 ) , the album supported by the tour . The concert footage includes political and social statements made during the shows . It is the band 's second feature film , following their 1988 rockumentary Rattle and Hum . Among several cinematic firsts , U2 3D was the first live-action digital 3D film . The project was created to experiment with a new type of 3D film technology pioneered by producer Steve Schklair . After considering shooting American football games in 3D , Schklair 's company 3ality Digital decided to create a concert film with U2 . The band were hesitant to participate , but agreed to the project mainly as a technological experiment rather than a profit-making venture . Although set in Buenos Aires , U2 3D was shot at seven concerts across Latin America , and two in Australia . The film 's complex setup involved shooting with up to 18 3D cameras simultaneously and capturing the footage digitally . After a preview screening at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival , U2 3D premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival and had its limited theatrical release in late January 2008 , followed by its wide release the following month . The film was distributed by National Geographic Entertainment and was only released in IMAX 3D and digital 3D theaters .",

  "/wiki/U2:_Rattle_and_Hum": "Rattle and Hum is a hybrid live/studio album by Irish rock band U2 , and a companion rockumentary film directed by Phil Joanou . The album was produced by Jimmy Iovine and was released on 10 October 1988 , while the film was distributed by Paramount Pictures and was released on 27 October 1988 . Following the breakthrough success of the band 's previous studio album , The Joshua Tree , the Rattle and Hum project captures their continued experiences with American roots music on the Joshua Tree Tour , further incorporating elements of blues rock , folk rock , and gospel music into their sound . A collection of new studio tracks , live performances , and cover songs , the project includes recordings at Sun Studios in Memphis and collaborations with Bob Dylan , B.B . King , and Harlem 's New Voices of Freedom gospel choir . Although Rattle and Hum was intended to represent the band paying tribute to rock legends , some critics accused U2 of trying to place themselves amongst the ranks of these artists . Critical reception to both the album and the film was mixed ; one Rolling Stone editor spoke of the album 's excitement , another described it as misguided and bombastic . The film grossed just $ 8.6 million , but the album was a commercial success , reaching number one in several countries and selling 14 million copies . Lead single Desire became the band 's first UK number-one song while reaching number three in the US . Facing creative stagnation and a critical backlash to Rattle and Hum , U2 reinvented themselves in the 1990s through a new musical direction and public image .",

  "/wiki/Unfinished_Symphony": "Franz Schubert 's Symphony No . 8 in B minor , D 759 ( sometimes renumbered as Symphony No . 7 , in accordance with the revised Deutsch catalogue and the Neue Schubert-Ausgabe ) , commonly known as the Unfinished Symphony ( German : Unvollendete ) , is a musical composition that Schubert started in 1822 but left with only two movements - though he lived for another six years . A scherzo , nearly completed in piano score but with only two pages orchestrated , also survives . It has been theorized by some musicologists , including Brian Newbould , that Schubert may have sketched a finale that instead became the big B minor entr'acte from his incidental music to Rosamunde , but all evidence for this is circumstantial . One possible reason for Schubert 's leaving the symphony incomplete is the predominance of the same meter ( triple meter ) . The first movement is in 34 , the second in 38 and the third ( an incomplete scherzo ) again in 34 . Three consecutive movements in basically the same meter rarely occur in symphonies , sonatas , or chamber works of the most important Viennese composers . Schubert 's Eighth Symphony is sometimes called the first Romantic symphony due to its emphasis on the lyrical impulse within the dramatic structure of Classical sonata form . Furthermore , its orchestration is not solely tailored for functionality , but specific combinations of instrumental timbre that are prophetic of the later Romantic movement , with astonishing vertical spacing occurring for example at the beginning of the development . To this day , musicologists still disagree as to why Schubert failed to complete the symphony . Some have speculated that he stopped work in the middle of the scherzo in the fall of 1822 because he associated it with his initial outbreak of syphilis - or that he was distracted by the inspiration for his Wanderer Fantasy for solo piano , which occupied his time and energy immediately afterward .",
