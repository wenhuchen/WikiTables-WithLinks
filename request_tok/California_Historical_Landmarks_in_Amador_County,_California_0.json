The park is nestled in a little valley 2,400 feet ( 732 m ) above sea level , with open meadows and large specimens of valley oak that once provided the Miwok peoples of this area with an ample supply of acorns . The 135-acre ( 55 ha ) park was established in 1962 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 . The native name for the site is Chawse , the Miwok word for grinding rock . Upon this rock they ground acorns and other seeds into meal , slowly forming the cup-shaped depressions in the stone , which can still be seen today . Along with the mortar holes , the main grinding rock within the park features a number of petroglyphs : circles , spoked wheels , animal and human tracks , wavy lines , etc . Some of these carvings are thought to be as much as two or three thousand years old and are now becoming difficult to discern .
