Along with traditional Chinese characters , they are one of the two standard character sets of the contemporary Chinese written language . The government of the People 's Republic of China in mainland China has promoted them for use in printing since the 1950s and 1960s to encourage literacy . They are officially used in the People 's Republic of China , Malaysia , and Singapore . Traditional Chinese characters are officially used in Hong Kong , Macau , the Republic of China ( Taiwan ) and occasionally in the Chinese community of Malaysia and Singapore . Other Overseas Chinese communities generally tend to use traditional characters . [ citation needed ] Simplified Chinese characters may be referred to by their official name above or colloquially ( \u7b80\u4f53\u5b57 ; ji\u01cent\u01d0z\u00ec ) . The latter refers to simplifications of character structure or body , character forms that have existed for thousands of years alongside regular , more complicated forms . On the other hand , the official name refers to the modern systematically simplified character set , which ( as stated by then-Chairman Mao Zedong in 1952 ) includes not only structural simplification but also substantial reduction in the total number of standardized Chinese characters . Simplified character forms were created by reducing the number of strokes and simplifying the forms of a sizable proportion of Chinese characters . Some simplifications were based on popular cursive forms embodying graphic or phonetic simplifications of the traditional forms . Some characters were simplified by applying regular rules , for example , by replacing all occurrences of a certain component with a simplified version of the component .",

It is often used to teach Standard Mandarin Chinese , which is normally written using Chinese characters . The system includes four diacritics denoting tones . Pinyin without tone marks is used to spell Chinese names and words in languages written with the Latin alphabet and also in certain computer input methods to enter Chinese characters . The pinyin system was developed in the 1950s by many linguists , including Zhou Youguang , based on earlier forms of romanizations of Chinese . It was published by the Chinese government in 1958 and revised several times . The International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) adopted pinyin as an international standard in 1982 , and was followed by the United Nations in 1986 . The system was adopted as the official standard in Taiwan in 2009 , where it is used for international events rather than for educational or computer-input purposes . But some cities , businesses , and organizations , notably in the south of Taiwan , did not accept this , as it suggested that Taiwan is more closely tied to the PRC , so it remains one of several rival romanization systems in use . The word H\u00e0ny\u01d4 ( simplified Chinese : \u6c49\u8bed ; traditional Chinese : \u6f22\u8a9e ) means 'the spoken language of the Han people ' , while P\u012bny\u012bn ( \u62fc\u97f3 ) literally means 'spelled sounds ' .",

Chinese languages are spoken by the ethnic Chinese majority and many minority ethnic groups in China . About 1.2 billion people ( around 16% of the world 's population ) speak some form of Chinese as their first language . The varieties of Chinese are usually considered by native speakers to be regional variants of ethnic Chinese speech , without consideration of whether they are mutually intelligible . Due to their lack of mutual intelligibility , linguists generally describe them as distinct languages , perhaps hundreds , sometimes noting that they are more varied than the Romance languages . [ b ] Investigation of the historical relationships among the Sinitic languages is just getting started . Currently , most classifications posit 7 to 13 main regional groups , based on often superficial phonetic developments , of which the most populous by far is Mandarin ( about 800 million speakers , e.g . Southwestern Mandarin ) , followed by Min ( 75 million , e.g . Southern Min ) , Wu ( 74 million , e.g . Shanghainese ) , Yue ( 68 million , e.g . Cantonese ) .

It is used on occasion by many ethnic minorities who adhere to the Islamic faith in China ( mostly the Hui , but also the Dongxiang and the Salar ) and formerly by their Dungan descendants in Central Asia . Orthography reforms introduced the Latin script and later the Cyrillic script to the Dungan language , which continue to be used today . Xiao'erjing is written from right to left , as with other writing systems using the Perso-Arabic script . The Xiao'erjing writing system is unusual among Arabic script-based writing systems in that all vowels , long and short , are explicitly marked at all times with Arabic diacritics , unlike some other Arabic-based writing such as the Uyghur Ereb Y\u00e9ziqi which uses full letters and not diacritics to mark short vowels . This makes it a true abugida . Both of these practices are in contrast to the practice of omitting the short vowels in the majority of the languages for which the Arabic script has been adopted ( such as Arabic , Persian and Urdu ) . This is possibly due to the overarching importance of the vowel in a Chinese syllable .",

  "/wiki/Mongolian_language": "Mongolian [ note 1 ] is the official language of Mongolia and both the most widely spoken and best-known member of the Mongolic language family . The number of speakers across all its dialects may be 5.2 million , including the vast majority of the residents of Mongolia and many of the Mongolian residents of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of the People 's Republic of China . In Mongolia , the Khalkha dialect , written in Cyrillic ( and at times in Latin for social networking ) , is predominant , while in Inner Mongolia , the language is dialectally more diverse and is written in the traditional Mongolian script . In the discussion of grammar to follow , the variety of Mongolian treated is Standard Khalkha Mongolian ( i.e. , the standard written language as formalized in the writing conventions and in grammar as taught in schools ) , but much of what is to be said is also valid for vernacular ( spoken ) Khalkha and for other Mongolian dialects , especially Chakhar . Some classify several other Mongolic languages like Buryat and Oirat as dialects of Mongolian , but this classification is not in line with the current international standard . Mongolian has vowel harmony and a complex syllabic structure for a Mongolic language that allows clusters of up to three consonants syllable-finally . It is a typical agglutinative language that relies on suffix chains in the verbal and nominal domains . While there is a basic word order , subject-object-predicate , ordering among noun phrases is relatively free , so grammatical roles are indicated by a system of about eight grammatical cases . There are five voices . Verbs are marked for voice , aspect , tense , and epistemic modality/evidentiality . In sentence linking , a special role is played by converbs . Modern Mongolian evolved from Middle Mongol , the language spoken in the Mongol Empire of the 13th and 14th centuries .",

Sichuan 's capital city is Chengdu . The population of Sichuan stands at 81 million . In antiquity , Sichuan was the home of the ancient states of Ba and Shu . Their conquest by Qin strengthened it and paved the way for the Qin Shi Huang 's unification of China under the Qin dynasty . During the Three Kingdoms era , Liu Bei 's Shu was based in Sichuan . The area was devastated in the 17th century by Zhang Xianzhong 's rebellion and the area 's subsequent Manchu conquest , but recovered to become one of China 's most productive areas by the 19th century . During World War II , Chongqing served as the temporary capital of the Republic of China , making it the focus of Japanese bombing . It was one of the last mainland areas to fall to the Communists during the Chinese Civil War and was divided into four parts from 1949 to 1952 , with Chongqing restored two years later . It suffered gravely during the Great Chinese Famine of 1959-61 but remained China 's most populous province until Chongqing Municipality was again separated from it in 1997 . The people of Sichuan speak a unique form of Mandarin , which took shape during the area 's repopulation under the Ming .

In 1940 due to general Soviet policy , a Cyrillic alphabet eventually became common and has remained so to this day , though some Kyrgyz still use the Arabic alphabet . When Kyrgyzstan became independent following the Soviet Union 's collapse in 1991 , there was a popular idea among some Kyrgyzstanis to switch to the Latin script , which is still common in some small pockets of the countryside and make the Latin script the countrys official national script ( taking in mind a version closer to the Turkish alphabet rather than the original alphabet of 1928-40 ) .
