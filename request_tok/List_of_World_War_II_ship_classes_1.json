  "/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Akagi": "Akagi ( Japanese : \u8d64\u57ce ; Red Castle ) was an aircraft carrier built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) , named after Mount Akagi in present-day Gunma Prefecture . Though she was laid down as an Amagi-class battlecruiser , Akagi was converted to an aircraft carrier while still under construction to comply with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty . The ship was rebuilt from 1935 to 1938 with her original three flight decks consolidated into a single enlarged flight deck and an island superstructure . The second Japanese aircraft carrier to enter service , and the first large or fleet carrier , Akagi and the related Kaga figured prominently in the development of the IJN 's new carrier striking force doctrine that grouped carriers together , concentrating their air power . This doctrine enabled Japan to attain its strategic goals during the early stages of the Pacific War from December 1941 until mid-1942 . Akagi 's aircraft served in the Second Sino-Japanese War in the late 1930s . Upon the formation of the First Air Fleet or Kido Butai ( Striking Force ) in early 1941 , she became its flagship , and remained so for the duration of her service . With other fleet carriers , she took part in the Attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and the invasion of Rabaul in the Southwest Pacific in January 1942 . The following month , her aircraft bombed Darwin , Australia , and assisted in the conquest of the Dutch East Indies . In March and April 1942 , Akagi 's aircraft helped sink a British heavy cruiser and an Australian destroyer in the Indian Ocean Raid . After a brief refit , Akagi and three other fleet carriers of the Kido Butai participated in the Battle of Midway in June 1942 . After bombarding American forces on the atoll , Akagi and the other carriers were attacked by aircraft from Midway and the carriers Enterprise , Hornet , and Yorktown .",
  "/wiki/Aircraft_carrier": "An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase , equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying , arming , deploying , and recovering aircraft . Typically , it is the capital ship of a fleet , as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations . Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighters , strike aircraft , helicopters , and other types of aircraft . While heavier aircraft such as fixed-wing gunships and bombers have been launched from aircraft carriers , it is currently not possible to land them . By its diplomatic and tactical power , its mobility , its autonomy and the variety of its means , the aircraft carrier is often the centerpiece of modern combat fleets . Tactically or even strategically , it replaced the battleship in the role of flagship of a fleet . One of its great advantages is that , by sailing in international waters , it does not interfere with any territorial sovereignty and thus obviates the need for overflight authorizations from third-party countries , reduces the times and transit distances of aircraft and therefore significantly increase the time of availability on the combat zone .",

The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force ( JMSDF ) was formed circa 1952-1954 after the dissolution of the IJN . The Imperial Japanese Navy was the third largest navy in the world by 1920 , behind the Royal Navy and the United States Navy ( USN ) . It was supported by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service for aircraft and airstrike operation from the fleet . It was the primary opponent of the Western Allies in the Pacific War . The origins of the Imperial Japanese Navy go back to early interactions with nations on the Asian continent , beginning in the early medieval period and reaching a peak of activity during the 16th and 17th centuries at a time of cultural exchange with European powers during the Age of Discovery . After two centuries of stagnation during the country 's ensuing seclusion policy under the sh\u014dgun of the Edo period , Japan 's navy was comparatively backward when the country was forced open to trade by American intervention in 1854 . This eventually led to the Meiji Restoration . Accompanying the re-ascendance of the Emperor came a period of frantic modernization and industrialization . The navy had several successes , sometimes against much more powerful enemies such as in the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War , before being largely destroyed in World War II .",

  "/wiki/Submarine": "A submarine ( or sub ) is a watercraft capable of independent operation underwater . It differs from a submersible , which has more limited underwater capability . It is also sometimes used historically or colloquially to refer to remotely operated vehicles and robots , as well as medium-sized or smaller vessels , such as the midget submarine and the wet sub . Submarines are referred to as boats rather than ships irrespective of their size . Although experimental submarines had been built before , submarine design took off during the 19th century , and they were adopted by several navies . Submarines were first widely used during World War I ( 1914-1918 ) , and are now used in many navies large and small . Military uses include attacking enemy surface ships ( merchant and military ) , or other submarines , aircraft carrier protection , blockade running , ballistic missile submarines as part of a nuclear strike force , reconnaissance , conventional land attack ( for example using a cruise missile ) , and covert insertion of special forces . Civilian uses for submarines include marine science , salvage , exploration and facility inspection and maintenance . Submarines can also be modified to perform more specialized functions such as search-and-rescue missions or undersea cable repair . Submarines are also used in tourism and undersea archaeology . Most large submarines consist of a cylindrical body with hemispherical ( or conical ) ends and a vertical structure , usually located amidships , which houses communications and sensing devices as well as periscopes . In modern submarines , this structure is the sail in American usage and fin in European usage .",
  "/wiki/United_States_Navy": "The United States Navy ( USN ) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the eight uniformed services of the United States . It is the largest and most capable navy in the world and it has been estimated that in terms of tonnage of its active battle fleet alone , it is larger than the next 13 navies combined , which includes 11 U.S. allies or partner nations . It has the highest combined battle fleet tonnage and the world 's largest aircraft carrier fleet , with eleven in service , two new carriers under construction , and five other carriers planned . With 336,978 personnel on active duty and 101,583 in the Ready Reserve , the U.S. Navy is the third largest of the U.S. military service branches in terms of personnel . It has 290 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 operational aircraft as of June 2019 [ update ] , making it the third-largest air force in the world , after the United States Air Force and the United States Army . The U.S. Navy traces its origins to the Continental Navy , which was established during the American Revolutionary War and was effectively disbanded as a separate entity shortly thereafter . After suffering significant loss of goods and personnel at the hands of the Barbary pirates from Algiers , the U.S. Congress passed the Naval Act of 1794 for the construction of six heavy frigates , the first ships of the U.S. Navy . The U.S. Navy played a major role in the American Civil War by blockading the Confederacy and seizing control of its rivers . It played the central role in the World War II defeat of Imperial Japan .

  "/wiki/HMS_Ark_Royal_(91)": "HMS Ark Royal ( pennant number 91 ) was an aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy that served during the Second World War . Designed in 1934 to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty , Ark Royal was built by Cammell Laird at Birkenhead , England , and completed in November 1938 . Her design differed from previous aircraft carriers . Ark Royal was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull , instead of an add-on or part of the superstructure . Designed to carry a large number of aircraft , she had two hangar deck levels . She served during a period that first saw the extensive use of naval air power ; several carrier tactics were developed and refined aboard Ark Royal . Ark Royal served in some of the most active naval theatres of the Second World War . She was involved in the first aerial and U-boat kills of the war , operations off Norway , the search for the German battleship Bismarck , and the Malta Convoys . Ark Royal survived several near misses and gained a reputation as a 'lucky ship ' . She was torpedoed on 13 November 1941 by the German submarine U-81 and sank the following day ; one of her 1,488 crew members was killed . Her sinking was the subject of several inquiries ; investigators were keen to know how the carrier was lost , in spite of efforts to save the ship and tow her to the naval base at Gibraltar . They found that several design flaws contributed to the loss , which were rectified in new British carriers .",
  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels .",

  "/wiki/Graf_Zeppelin-class_aircraft_carrier": "The Graf Zeppelin-class aircraft carriers were four German Kriegsmarine aircraft carriers planned in the mid-1930s by Grand Admiral Erich Raeder as part of the Plan Z rearmament program after Germany and Great Britain signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement . They were planned after a thorough study of Japanese carrier designs . German naval architects ran into difficulties due to lack of experience in building such vessels , the situational realities of carrier operations in the North Sea and the lack of overall clarity in the ships ' mission objectives . This lack of clarity led to features such as cruiser-type guns for commerce raiding and defense against British cruisers , that were either eliminated from or not included in American and Japanese carrier designs . American and Japanese carriers , designed along the lines of task-force defense , used supporting cruisers for surface firepower , which allowed flight operations to continue without disruption and kept carriers out of undue risk of damage or sinking from surface action . A combination of political infighting between the Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe , disputes within the ranks of the Kriegsmarine itself and Adolf Hitler 's waning interest all conspired against the carriers . A shortage of workers and materials slowed construction still further and , in 1939 , Raeder reduced the number of ships from four to two . Even so , the Luftwaffe trained its first unit of pilots for carrier service and readied it for flight operations . With the advent of World War II , priorities shifted to U-boat construction ; one carrier , Flugzeugtr\u00e4ger B , was broken up on the slipway while work on the other , Flugzeugtr\u00e4ger A ( christened Graf Zeppelin ) was continued tentatively but suspended in 1940 . The air unit scheduled for her was disbanded at that time . The role of aircraft in the Battle of Taranto , the pursuit of the German battleship Bismarck , the attack on Pearl Harbor and the Battle of Midway demonstrated conclusively the usefulness of aircraft carriers in modern naval warfare . With Hitler 's authorization , work resumed on the remaining carrier .",

It superseded the Imperial German Navy of the German Empire ( 1871-1918 ) and the inter-war Reichsmarine ( 1919-1935 ) of the Weimar Republic . The Kriegsmarine was one of three official branches , along with the Heer and the Luftwaffe of the Wehrmacht , the German armed forces from 1933 to 1945 . In violation of the Treaty of Versailles , the Kriegsmarine grew rapidly during German naval rearmament in the 1930s . The 1919 treaty had limited the size of the German navy and prohibited the building of submarines . Kriegsmarine ships were deployed to the waters around Spain during the Spanish Civil War ( 1936-1939 ) under the guise of enforcing non-intervention , but in reality supported the Nationalists against the Spanish Republicans . In January 1939 , Plan Z was ordered , calling for surface naval parity with the British Royal Navy by 1944 . When World War II broke out in September 1939 , Plan Z was shelved in favour of a crash building program for submarines ( U-boats ) instead of capital surface warships and land and air forces were given priority of strategic resources . The Commander-in-Chief of the Kriegsmarine ( as for all branches of armed forces during the period of absolute Nazi power ) was Adolf Hitler , who exercised his authority through the Oberkommando der Marine . The Kriegsmarine 's most significant ships were the U-boats , most of which were constructed after Plan Z was abandoned at the beginning of World War II . Wolfpacks were rapidly assembled groups of submarines which attacked British convoys during the first half of the Battle of the Atlantic but this tactic was largely abandoned by May 1943 when U-boat losses mounted .",

  "/wiki/HMS_Hood": "HMS Hood ( pennant number 51 ) was the last battlecruiser built for the Royal Navy . Commissioned in 1920 , she was named after the 18th-century Admiral Samuel Hood . One of four Admiral-class battlecruisers ordered in mid-1916 , Hood had design limitations , though her design was revised after the Battle of Jutland and improved while she was under construction . For this reason , she was the only ship of her class to be completed . Despite the appearance of new and more modern ship designs over time , Hood remained the largest and most powerful warship in the world for 20 years after her commissioning , and her prestige was reflected in her nickname , The Mighty Hood . Hood was involved in several showing-the-flag exercises between her commissioning in 1920 and the outbreak of war in 1939 , including training exercises in the Mediterranean Sea and a circumnavigation of the globe with the Special Service Squadron in 1923 and 1924 . She was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet following the outbreak of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War . When the Spanish Civil War broke out , Hood was officially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet until she had to return to Britain in 1939 for an overhaul . By this time , advances in naval gunnery had reduced Hood 's usefulness . She was scheduled to undergo a major rebuild in 1941 to correct these issues , but the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 forced the ship into service without the upgrades . When war with Germany was declared , Hood was operating in the area around Iceland , and she spent the next several months hunting for German commerce raiders and blockade runners between Iceland and the Norwegian Sea . After a brief overhaul of her propulsion system , she sailed as the flagship of Force H , and participated in the destruction of the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir .",
  "/wiki/Battlecruiser": "The battlecruiser , or battle-cruiser , was a type of capital ship of the first half of the 20th century . They were similar in displacement , armament and cost to battleships , but differed slightly in form and balance of attributes . Battlecruisers typically had slightly thinner armour and a lighter main gun battery than contemporary battleships , installed on a longer hull with much higher engine power in order to attain greater speeds . The first battlecruisers were designed in the United Kingdom in the first decade of the century , as a development of the armoured cruiser , at the same time as the dreadnought succeeded the pre-dreadnought battleship . The goal of the design was to outrun any ship with similar armament , and chase down any ship with lesser armament ; they were intended to hunt down slower , older armoured cruisers and destroy them with heavy gunfire while avoiding combat with the more powerful but slower battleships . However , as more and more battlecruisers were built , they were increasingly used alongside the better-protected battleships . Battlecruisers served in the navies of the UK , Germany , the Ottoman Empire , Australia and Japan during World War I , most notably at the Battle of the Falkland Islands and in the several raids and skirmishes in the North Sea which culminated in a pitched fleet battle , the Battle of Jutland . British battlecruisers in particular suffered heavy losses at Jutland , where poor fire safety and ammunition handling practices left them vulnerable to catastrophic magazine explosions following hits to their main turrets from large-calibre shells . This dismal showing led to a persistent general belief that battlecruisers were too thinly armoured to function successfully . By the end of the war , capital ship design had developed , with battleships becoming faster and battlecruisers becoming more heavily armoured , blurring the distinction between a battlecruiser and a fast battleship . The Washington Naval Treaty , which limited capital ship construction from 1922 onwards , treated battleships and battlecruisers identically , and the new generation of battlecruisers planned was scrapped under the terms of the treaty . Improvements in armor design and propulsion created the 1930s fast battleship with the speed of a battlecruiser and armor of a battleship , making the battlecruiser in the traditional sense effectively an obsolete concept .",
  "/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Kaga": "Kaga ( \u52a0\u8cc0 ) was an aircraft carrier built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) and was named after the former Kaga Province in present-day Ishikawa Prefecture . Originally intended to be one of two Tosa-class battleships , Kaga was converted under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty to an aircraft carrier as the replacement for the battlecruiser Amagi , which had been damaged during the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake . Kaga was rebuilt in 1933-1935 , increasing her top speed , improving her exhaust systems , and adapting her flight decks to more modern , heavier aircraft . The ship figured prominently in the development of the IJN 's carrier striking force doctrine , which grouped carriers together to give greater mass and concentration to their air power . A revolutionary strategic concept at the time , the employment of the doctrine was crucial in enabling Japan to attain its initial strategic goals during the first six months of the Pacific War . Kaga 's aircraft first supported Japanese troops in China during the Shanghai Incident of 1932 and participated in the Second Sino-Japanese War in the late 1930s . With other carriers , she took part in the Pearl Harbor raid in December 1941 and the invasion of Rabaul in the Southwest Pacific in January 1942 . The following month her aircraft participated in a combined carrier airstrike on Darwin , Australia , helping secure the conquest of the Dutch East Indies by Japanese forces . She missed the Indian Ocean raid in April as she had to return to Japan for repairs after hitting a reef in February . Following repairs , Kaga rejoined the 1st Air Fleet for the Battle of Midway in June 1942 . After bombarding American forces on Midway Atoll , Kaga and three other IJN carriers were attacked by American aircraft from Midway and the carriers Enterprise , Hornet , and Yorktown . Dive bombers from Enterprise severely damaged Kaga ; when it became obvious she could not be saved , she was scuttled by Japanese destroyers to prevent her from falling into enemy hands .",
  "/wiki/USS_Ranger_(CV-4)": "USS Ranger ( CV-4 ) was an interwar United States Navy aircraft carrier , the only ship of its class . As a Treaty ship , Ranger was the first U.S. vessel to be designed and built from the keel up as a carrier . It was relatively small , just 730 ' long and under 15,000 long tons ( 15,000 t ) , closer in size and displacement to the first US carrier - Langley - than later ships . An island superstructure was not included in the original design , but was added after completion . Deemed too slow for use with the Pacific Fleet 's carrier task forces against Japan , the ship spent most of World War II in the Atlantic Ocean where the German fleet , the Kriegsmarine , was a weaker opponent . Ranger saw combat in that theatre and provided air support for Operation Torch . In October 1943 , she fought in Operation Leader , air attacks on German shipping off Norway . The ship was sold for scrap in 1947 .",
  "/wiki/USS_Wichita_(CA-45)": "USS Wichita ( CA-45 ) was a unique heavy cruiser of the United States Navy built in the 1930s . The last American cruiser designed to meet the limits of London Naval Treaty , she was originally intended to be a New Orleans-class heavy cruiser , accordingly with the maximum main armament of three triple 8-inch ( 203 mm ) gun turrets . These were instead placed on an improved hull derived from the Brooklyn-class light cruisers , with increased armoring . This design would go on to form the basis for the later World War II-era heavy cruisers such as the Baltimore-class cruisers . The ship was authorized by the 1929 Cruiser Act , laid down at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in October 1935 , launched in November 1937 , and commissioned into the US Navy in February 1939 . Following her commissioning , Wichita was assigned to neutrality patrols in the Atlantic . After the United States entered World War II , the ship saw heavy service throughout the conflict . She was first assigned to convoy escort duty on the Murmansk Run in early 1942 , and supported amphibious landings during Operation Torch in November 1942 . During the Naval Battle of Casablanca , Wichita engaged several French coastal batteries and warships , including the battleship Jean Bart . In 1943 , Wichita was transferred to the Pacific Theater , where she remained for the rest of the war . She frequently provided antiaircraft defense for the Fast Carrier Task Force during operations in the central Pacific , including the Battles of the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf in 1944 . During the latter engagement , Wichita assisted in the sinking of the Japanese aircraft carrier Chiyoda .",
  "/wiki/Heavy_cruiser": "The heavy cruiser was a type of cruiser , a naval warship designed for long range and high speed , armed generally with naval guns of roughly 203 mm ( 8 inches ) in caliber , whose design parameters were dictated by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the London Naval Treaty of 1930 . The heavy cruiser is part of a lineage of ship design from 1915 through the early 1950s , although the term heavy cruiser only came into formal use in 1930 . The heavy cruiser 's immediate precursors were the light cruiser designs of the 1900s and 1910s , rather than the armoured cruisers of the years before 1905 . When the armoured cruiser was supplanted by the battlecruiser , an intermediate ship type between this and the light cruiser was found to be needed - one larger and more powerful than the light cruisers of a potential enemy but not as large and expensive as the battlecruiser so as to be built in sufficient numbers to protect merchant ships and serve in a number of combat theaters . With their intended targets being other cruisers and smaller vessels , the role of the heavy cruiser differed fundamentally from that of the armored cruiser . Also , the heavy cruiser was designed to take advantage of advances in naval technology and design . Typically powered by oil-fired steam turbines rather than the reciprocating steam engines of the armoured cruiser , heavy cruisers were capable of far faster speeds and could cruise at high speed for much longer than could an armoured cruiser . They used uniform main guns , mounted in center-line superfiring turrets rather than casemates . Casemate guns and a mixed battery were eliminated to make room for above deck torpedoes , and ever increasing and more effective anti-aircraft armaments . They also benefited from the superior fire control of the 1920s and continually upgraded through the 1950s . Late in the development cycle radar and electronic countermeasure would also appear and rapidly gain in importance . These developments meant that the heavy cruiser was an overall more powerful ship type than the armoured cruiser had been .",

She was the only destroyer to be armed with 15 torpedo tubes , each capable of firing the deadly 610 mm ( 24 in ) Type 93 Long Lance torpedo . The ship also served as a testbed for an enormously powerful , high-temperature , high-pressure steam turbine that was able to develop 79,240 shp ( 59,090 kW ) . This made her one of the fastest destroyers in the world : her design speed was 39 kn ( 72 km/h ; 45 mph ) , but on trials she made 40.9 kn ( 75.7 km/h ; 47.1 mph ) .",
  "/wiki/Destroyer": "In naval terminology , a destroyer is a fast , maneuverable , long-endurance warship intended to escort larger vessels in a fleet , convoy or battle group and defend them against powerful short range attackers . They were originally developed in the late 19th century by Fernando Villaamil for the Spanish Navy as a defense against torpedo boats , and by the time of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 , these torpedo boat destroyers ( TBDs ) were large , swift , and powerfully armed torpedo boats designed to destroy other torpedo boats . Although the term destroyer had been used interchangeably with TBD and torpedo boat destroyer by navies since 1892 , the term torpedo boat destroyer had been generally shortened to simply destroyer by nearly all navies by the First World War . Before World War II , destroyers were light vessels with little endurance for unattended ocean operations ; typically a number of destroyers and a single destroyer tender operated together . After the war , the advent of the guided missile allowed destroyers to take on the surface combatant roles previously filled by battleships and cruisers . This resulted in larger and more powerful guided missile destroyers more capable of independent operation . At the start of the 21st century , destroyers are the global standard for surface combatant ships , with only two nations ( United States and Russia ) operating the heavier class cruisers , with no battleships or true battlecruisers remaining . Modern guided missile destroyers are equivalent in tonnage but vastly superior in firepower to cruisers of the World War II era , and are capable of carrying nuclear-tipped cruise missiles . At 510 feet ( 160 m ) long , a displacement of 9,200 tons , and with armament of more than 90 missiles , guided missile destroyers such as the Arleigh Burke-class are actually larger and more heavily armed than most previous ships classified as guided missile cruisers . Some European navies , such as the French , Spanish , Dutch or German , use the term frigate for their destroyers , which leads to some confusion . After the Second World War , destroyers grew in size . The Allen M. Sumner-class destroyer had a displacement of 2200 tons , while the Arleigh Burke class has a displacement of up to 9600 tons , thus growing in size almost 340% .",
  "/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_S\u014dry\u016b": "S\u014dry\u016b ( \u84bc\u9f8d , S\u014dry\u016b , meaning Blue ( or Green ) Dragon ) was a S\u014dry\u016b-class aircraft carrier built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) during the mid-1930s . A single sister ship , Hiry\u016b , was intended to follow S\u014dry\u016b , but Hiry\u016b 's design was heavily modified and she is often considered to be a separate class . [ Note 1 ] S\u014dry\u016b 's aircraft were employed in operations during the Second Sino-Japanese War in the late 1930s and supported the Japanese invasion of French Indochina in mid-1940 . During the first months of the Pacific War , she took part in the attack on Pearl Harbor , the Battle of Wake Island , and supported the conquest of the Dutch East Indies . In February 1942 , her aircraft bombed Darwin , Australia , and she continued on to assist in the Dutch East Indies campaign . In April , S\u014dry\u016b 's aircraft helped sink two British heavy cruisers and several merchant ships during the Indian Ocean raid . After a brief refit , S\u014dry\u016b and three other carriers of the 1st Air Fleet ( Kid\u014d Butai ) participated in the Battle of Midway in June 1942 . After bombarding American forces on Midway Atoll , the carriers were attacked by aircraft from the island and the carriers Enterprise , Hornet , and Yorktown . Dive bombers from Yorktown crippled S\u014dry\u016b and set her afire . Japanese destroyers rescued the survivors but the ship could not be salvaged and was ordered to be scuttled so as to allow her attendant destroyers to be released for further operations . She sank with the loss of 711 officers and enlisted men of the 1,103 aboard . The loss of S\u014dry\u016b and three other IJN carriers at Midway was a crucial strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to the Allies ' ultimate victory in the Pacific .",
  "/wiki/French_submarine_Surcouf": "Surcouf was the largest French cruiser submarine . She served in both the French Navy and the Free French Naval Forces during the Second World War . She was lost during the night of 18/19 February 1942 in the Caribbean Sea , possibly after colliding with an American freighter . Surcouf was named after the French privateer Robert Surcouf . She was the largest submarine built until surpassed by the first Japanese I-400-class submarine in 1943 .",
  "/wiki/Cruiser_submarine": "A cruiser submarine was a very large submarine designed to remain at sea for extended periods in areas distant from base facilities . Cruiser submarines were successful for a brief period of World War I , but were less successful than smaller submarines during World War II . Large submarines remained vulnerable to damage from Defensively equipped merchant ships ( DEMS ) , were slow to dive if found by aircraft , offered a large sonar echo surface , and were less able to defensively maneuver during depth charge attacks .",
  "/wiki/French_Navy": "The French Navy ( French : Marine Nationale , lit . National Navy ) , informally La Royale , is the maritime arm of the French Armed Forces . Dating back to 1624 , the French Navy is one of the world 's oldest naval forces . It has participated in conflicts around the globe and played a key part in establishing the French colonial empire . The French Navy consists of six main branches and various services : the Force d'Action Navale , the Forces Sous-marines ( FOST , ESNA ) , French Naval Aviation , the Fusiliers Marins ( including Commandos Marine ) , the Marins Pompiers , and the Maritime Gendarmerie . As of June 2014 , the French Navy employed a total of 36,776 personnel along with 2,800 civilians . Its reserve element consisted of 4,827 personnel of the Operational Reserve . As a blue-water navy , it operates a wide range of fighting vessels , which include the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle , various aeronaval forces , attack submarines and ballistic missile submarines , frigates , patrol boats and support ships .",
  "/wiki/Wasp-class_aircraft_carrier": "USS Wasp ( CV-7 ) was a United States Navy aircraft carrier commissioned in 1940 and lost in action in 1942 . She was the eighth ship named USS Wasp , and the sole ship of a class built to use up the remaining tonnage allowed to the U.S. for aircraft carriers under the treaties of the time . As a reduced-size version of the Yorktown-class aircraft carrier hull , Wasp was more vulnerable than other United States aircraft carriers available at the opening of hostilities . Wasp was initially employed in the Atlantic campaign , where Axis naval forces were perceived as less capable of inflicting decisive damage . After supporting the occupation of Iceland in 1941 , Wasp joined the British Home Fleet in April 1942 and twice ferried British fighter aircraft to Malta . Wasp was then transferred to the Pacific in June 1942 to replace losses at the battles of Coral Sea and Midway . After supporting the invasion of Guadalcanal , Wasp was hit by three torpedoes from Japanese submarine I-19 on 15 September 1942 . The resulting damage set off several explosions , destroyed her water-mains and knocked out the ship 's power . As a result , her damage-control teams were unable to contain the ensuing fires that blazed out of control . She was abandoned and scuttled by USS Lansdowne later that evening . Her wreck was found in early 2019 ."
