  "/wiki/Male": "A male ( \u2642 ) organism is the physiological sex that produces sperm . Each spermatozoon can fuse with a larger female gamete , or ovum , in the process of fertilization . A male can not reproduce sexually without access to at least one ovum from a female , but some organisms can reproduce both sexually and asexually . Most male mammals , including male humans , have a Y chromosome , which codes for the production of larger amounts of testosterone to develop male reproductive organs . Not all species share a common sex-determination system . In most animals , including humans , sex is determined genetically ; however , species such as Cymothoa exigua change sex depending on the number of females present in the vicinity .",
  "/wiki/Female": "Female ( symbol : \u2640 ) is the sex of an organism , or a part of an organism , that produces non-mobile ova ( egg cells ) . Barring rare medical conditions , most female mammals , including female humans , have two X chromosomes . Female characteristics vary between different species with some species containing more well defined female characteristics , such as the presence of pronounced mammary glands . There is no single genetic mechanism behind sex differences in different species and the existence of two sexes seems to have evolved multiple times independently in different evolutionary lineages . The word female comes from the Latin femella , the diminutive form of femina , meaning woman . It is not etymologically related to the word male .",
  "/wiki/Realm": "A realm /\u02c8r\u025blm/ is a community or territory over which a sovereign rules . The term is commonly used to describe a kingdom or other monarchical or dynastic state . A realm may also be a subdivision within an empire , if it has its own monarch , e.g . the German Empire . The Old French word reaume , modern French royaume , was the word first adopted in English ; the fixed modern spelling does not appear until the beginning of the 17th century . The word supposedly derives from medieval Latin regalimen , from regalis , of or belonging to a rex ( king ) . The word rex itself is derived from the Latin verb regere , which means to rule . Thus the literal meaning of the word realm is the territory of a ruler , traditionally a monarch ( emperor , king , grand duke , prince , etc. ) . Realm is particularly used for those states whose name includes the word kingdom ( for example , the United Kingdom ) , as elegant variation , to avoid clumsy repetition of the word in a sentence ( for example , The Queen 's realm , the United Kingdom. ) . It is also useful to describe those countries whose monarchs are called something other than king or queen ; for example , the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is a realm but not a kingdom , since its monarch holds the title Grand Duke rather than King . The term may commonly also be used to describe any one of the Commonwealth realms , which are kingdoms in their own right and share the same person as monarch , though they are fully independent of each other . More broadly , a realm may encompass territories that are subject to a monarch , yet are not a physical part of his or her kingdom ; for example , the Cook Islands and Niue are considered parts of the Realm of New Zealand , although they are not part of New Zealand proper .",

Since 1929 , the pope has official residence in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican City , the Holy See 's city-state enclaved within Rome , Italy . The current pope is Francis , who was elected on 13 March 2013 , succeeding Benedict XVI . While his office is called the papacy , the jurisdiction of the episcopal see is called the Holy See . It is the Holy See that is the sovereign entity by international law headquartered in the distinctively independent Vatican City State , established by the Lateran Treaty in 1929 between Italy and the Holy See to ensure its temporal , diplomatic , and spiritual independence . The primacy of the bishop of Rome is largely derived from his role as the apostolic successor to Saint Peter , to whom primacy was conferred by Jesus , giving him the Keys of Heaven and the powers of binding and loosing , naming him as the rock upon which the church would be built .

  "/wiki/Catholic_Church_doctrine_on_the_ordination_of_women": "In the liturgical traditions the Catholic Church the term ordination refers to the means by which a person is included in one of the orders of bishops , priests or deacons . The teaching of the Catholic Church on ordination , as expressed in the Code of Canon Law , the Catechism of the Catholic Church , and the apostolic letter Ordinatio sacerdotalis , is that only a Catholic male validly receives ordination , and that the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the Church 's faithful . As with priests and bishops , the church ordains only men as deacons . The church can not ordain anyone who has undergone sex reassignment surgery , and may sanction or require therapy for priests who are transsexual , regarding these to be an indicator of mental instability .",

  "/wiki/Papal_States": "The Papal States ( Italian : Stato Pontificio ) , officially the State of the Church ( Italian : Stato della Chiesa , Italian pronunciation : [ \u02c8sta\u02d0to della \u02c8kj\u025b\u02d0za ; \u02c8kje\u02d0- ] ; Latin : Status Ecclesiasticus ; also Dicio Pontificia ) were a series of territories in the Italian Peninsula under the direct sovereign rule of the Pope , from the 8th century until 1870 . They were among the major states of Italy from roughly the 8th century until the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia successfully unified the Italian Peninsula by conquest in a campaign virtually concluded in 1861 and definitively in 1870 . At their zenith , the Papal States covered most of the modern Italian regions of Lazio ( which includes Rome ) , Marche , Umbria and Romagna , and portions of Emilia . These holdings were considered to be a manifestation of the temporal power of the pope , as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy . By 1861 , much of the Papal States ' territory had been conquered by the Kingdom of Italy . Only Lazio , including Rome , remained under the Pope 's temporal control . In 1870 , the Pope lost Lazio and Rome and had no physical territory at all , except the Basilica of St Peter and the papal residence and related buildings around the Vatican quarter of Rome , which the new Italian state did not occupy militarily . In 1929 the head of the Italian government , at the time the Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini , ended the crisis between unified Italy and the Holy See by negotiating the Lateran Treaty , signed by the two parties . This recognized the sovereignty of the Holy See over a newly created international territorial entity , the Vatican City State , limited to a token territory .",

Established with the Lateran Treaty ( 1929 ) , it is distinct from , yet under full ownership , exclusive dominion , and sovereign authority and jurisdiction of the Holy See ( Latin : Sancta Sedes ) . [ g ] With an area of 44 hectares ( 110 acres ) , and a population of about 1,000 , it is the smallest sovereign state in the world by both area and population . The Vatican City is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state ( a type of theocracy ) ruled by the pope who is the bishop of Rome and head of the Catholic Church . The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various national origins . Since the return of the popes from Avignon in 1377 , they have generally resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City , although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere . The Holy See dates back to early Christianity , and is the primate episcopal see of the Catholic Church , with 1.3 billion Catholic Christians around the world distributed in the Latin Church and 23 Eastern Catholic Churches . The independent Vatican City-state , on the other hand , came into existence on 11 February 1929 by the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy , which spoke of it as a new creation , not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States ( 756-1870 ) , which had previously encompassed much of central Italy . Within the Vatican City are religious and cultural sites such as St. Peter 's Basilica , the Sistine Chapel , and the Vatican Museums .

  "/wiki/Pope_Joan": "Pope Joan ( Ioannes Anglicus ; 855-857 ) was , according to legend , a woman who reigned as pope for a few years during the Middle Ages . Her story first appeared in chronicles in the 13th century and subsequently spread throughout Europe . The story was widely believed for centuries , but most modern scholars regard it as fictional . Most versions of her story describe her as a talented and learned woman who disguised herself as a man , often at the behest of a lover . In the most common accounts , due to her abilities , she rose through the church hierarchy and was eventually elected pope . Her sex was revealed when she gave birth during a procession , and she died shortly after , either through murder or of natural causes . The accounts state that later church processions avoided this spot , and that the Vatican removed the female pope from its official lists and crafted a ritual to ensure that future popes were male . In the 16th century , Siena Cathedral featured a bust of Joan among other pontiffs ; this was removed after protests in 1600 . Jean de Mailly 's chronicle , written around 1250 , contains the first mention of an unnamed female pope , and it inspired several more accounts over the next several years . The most popular and influential version is that interpolated into Martin of Opava 's Chronicon Pontificum et Imperatorum , later in the 13th century . Martin introduced details that the female pope 's birth name was John Anglicus of Mainz , that she reigned in the 9th century , and that she entered the church to follow her lover . The legend was generally accepted as true until the 16th century , when a widespread debate among Catholic and Protestant writers called the story into question ; various writers noted the implausibly long gap between Joan 's supposed lifetime and her first appearance in texts .",

  "/wiki/Tarot": "The tarot ( /\u02c8t\u00e6ro\u028a/ ; first known as trionfi and later as tarocchi or tarock ) is a pack of playing cards , used from the mid-15th century in various parts of Europe to play games such as Italian tarocchini , French tarot and Austrian K\u00f6nigrufen , of which many are still played today . In the late 18th century , some tarot packs began to be used as a trend for divination via tarot card reading and cartomancy leading to custom packs developed for such occult purposes . Like common playing cards , the tarot has four suits which vary by region : French suits in Northern Europe , Latin suits in Southern Europe , and German suits in Central Europe . Each suit has 14 cards , ten pip cards numbering from one ( or Ace ) to ten and four face cards ( King , Queen , Knight , and Jack/Knave ) . In addition , the tarot has a separate 21-card trump suit and a single card known as the Fool . Depending on the game , the Fool may act as the top trump or may be played to avoid following suit . These tarot cards are still used throughout much of Europe to play conventional card games without occult associations . Among English-speaking countries where these games are not played frequently , tarot cards are used primarily for novelty and divinatory purposes , usually using specially designed packs . Some occult enthusiasts make relative claims to ancient Egypt , the Kabbalah , Indian Tantra , the I Ching , among many others , though no documented evidence of such origins or of the usage of tarot for divination before the 18th century has been demonstrated to a scholarly standard .",

Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings .

  "/wiki/Empire": "An empire is a sovereign state functioning as an aggregate of nations or people that are ruled over by an emperor or another kind of monarch . The territory and population of an empire is commonly of greater extent than the one of a kingdom . An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories , such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Russian Empire , or of territories far remote from the homeland , such as a colonial empire . Aside from the more formal usage , the word empire can also refer colloquially to a large-scale business enterprise ( e.g . a transnational corporation ) , a political organisation controlled by a single individual ( a political boss ) , or a group ( political bosses ) . The word empire is associated with such other words as imperialism , colonialism , and globalization . Empire is often used to describe a displeasure to overpowering situations . An imperial political structure can be established and maintained in two ways : ( i ) as a territorial empire of direct conquest and control with force or ( ii ) as a coercive , hegemonic empire of indirect conquest and control with power . The former method provides greater tribute and direct political control , yet limits further expansion because it absorbs military forces to fixed garrisons . The latter method provides less tribute and indirect control , but avails military forces for further expansion . Territorial empires ( e.g . the Mongol Empire and Median Empire ) tend to be contiguous areas .",

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD .

As a polity it included large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe , North Africa and West Asia ruled by emperors . From the accession of Caesar Augustus to the military anarchy of the third century , it was a principate with Italy as metropole of the provinces and its city of Rome as sole capital ( 27 BC - 286 AD ) . Although fragmented briefly during the military crisis , the empire was forcibly reassembled , then ruled by multiple emperors who shared rule over the Western Roman Empire ( based in Milan and later in Ravenna ) and over the Eastern Roman Empire ( based in Nicomedia and later in Constantinople ) . Rome remained the nominal capital of both parts until 476 AD , when it sent the imperial insignia to Constantinople ( Byzantium - Ancient Greek : \u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd , Byz\u00e1ntion ) following the capture of Ravenna by the barbarians of Odoacer and the subsequent deposition of Romulus Augustus . The fall of the Western Roman Empire to Germanic kings , along with the hellenization of the Eastern Roman Empire into the Byzantine Empire , conventionally marks the end of Ancient Rome and the beginning of the Middle Ages . The predecessor state of the Roman Empire , the Roman Republic ( which had replaced Rome 's monarchy in the 6th century BC ) became severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflicts . In the mid-1st century BC Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC . Civil wars and proscriptions continued , culminating in the victory of Octavian , Caesar 's adopted son , over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . The following year Octavian conquered Ptolemaic Egypt , ending the Hellenistic period that had begun with the conquests of Alexander the Great of Macedon in the 4th century BC . Octavian 's power then became unassailable , and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title Augustus , effectively making him the first Roman emperor . The first two centuries of the Empire saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana ( Roman Peace ) .",
  "/wiki/Byzantine_Empire": "The Byzantine Empire , also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire , or Byzantium , was the continuation of the Roman Empire in its eastern provinces during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages , when its capital city was Constantinople ( modern Istanbul , formerly Byzantium ) . It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 . During most of its existence , the empire was the most powerful economic , cultural and military force in Europe . Byzantine Empire is a term created after the end of the realm ; its citizens continued to refer to their empire simply as the Roman Empire ( Greek : \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd , tr .

Several signal events from the 4th to 6th centuries mark the period of transition during which the Roman Empire 's Greek East and Latin West diverged . Constantine I ( r. 324-337 ) reorganised the empire , made Constantinople the new capital and legalised Christianity . Under Theodosius I ( r. 379-395 ) , Christianity became the state religion and other religious practices were proscribed . In the reign of Heraclius ( r. 610-641 ) , the Empire 's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use in place of Latin . Although the Roman state continued and its traditions were maintained , modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome insofar as it was centred on Constantinople , oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture and characterised by Eastern Orthodox Christianity . The borders of the empire fluctuated through cycles of decline and recovery . During the reign of Justinian I ( r. 527-565 ) , the empire reached its greatest extent , after reconquering much of the historically Roman western Mediterranean coast , including North Africa , Italy and Rome , which it held for two more centuries .",

It was founded in 681 when Bulgar tribes led by Asparuh moved to the northeastern Balkans . There they secured Byzantine recognition of their right to settle south of the Danube by defeating - possibly with the help of local South Slavic tribes - the Byzantine army led by Constantine IV . At the height of its power , Bulgaria spread from the Danube Bend to the Black Sea and from the Dnieper River to the Adriatic Sea . As the state solidified its position in the Balkans , it entered into a centuries-long interaction , sometimes friendly and sometimes hostile , with the Byzantine Empire . Bulgaria emerged as Byzantium 's chief antagonist to its north , resulting in several wars . The two powers also enjoyed periods of peace and alliance , most notably during the Second Arab siege of Constantinople , where the Bulgarian army broke the siege and destroyed the Arab army , thus preventing an Arab invasion of Southeastern Europe . Byzantium had a strong cultural influence on Bulgaria , which also led to the eventual adoption of Christianity in 864 . After the disintegration of the Avar Khaganate , the country expanded its territory northwest to the Pannonian Plain . Later the Bulgarians confronted the advance of the Pechenegs and Cumans , and achieved a decisive victory over the Magyars , forcing them to establish themselves permanently in Pannonia . During the late 9th and early 10th centuries , Simeon I achieved a string of victories over the Byzantines .

Its size gradually diminished over time , particularly from 1648 onward , and by the time of its dissolution , it largely contained only German-speaking territories ( although Switzerland and East Prussia were not included ) , plus the Kingdom of Bohemia which was bordered by the German lands on three sides . At the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 , most of the Holy Roman Empire was included in the German Confederation . On 25 December 800 , Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish king Charlemagne as Emperor , reviving the title in Western Europe , more than three centuries after the fall of the earlier ancient Western Roman Empire in 476 . The title continued in the Carolingian family until 888 and from 896 to 899 , after which it was contested by the rulers of Italy in a series of civil wars until the death of the last Italian claimant , Berengar I , in 924 . The title was revived again in 962 when Otto I was crowned emperor , fashioning himself as the successor of Charlemagne and beginning a continuous existence of the empire for over eight centuries . Some historians refer to the coronation of Charlemagne as the origin of the empire , while others prefer the coronation of Otto I as its beginning . Scholars generally concur , however , in relating an evolution of the institutions and principles constituting the empire , describing a gradual assumption of the imperial title and role . The exact term Holy Roman Empire was not used until the 13th century , but the concept of translatio imperii , [ d ] the notion that he - the sovereign ruler - held supreme power inherited from the ancient emperors of Rome , was fundamental to the prestige of the emperor . The office of Holy Roman Emperor was traditionally elective , although frequently controlled by dynasties . The mostly German prince-electors , the highest-ranking noblemen of the empire , usually elected one of their peers as King of the Romans , and he would later be crowned emperor by the Pope ; the tradition of papal coronations was discontinued in the 16th century .",
  "/wiki/Imperial_Russia": "The Russian Empire [ a ] was an empire that extended across Eurasia and North America from 1721 , following the end of the Great Northern War , until the Republic was proclaimed by the Provisional Government that took power after the February Revolution of 1917 . The third-largest empire in history , at its greatest extent stretching over three continents , Europe , Asia , and North America , the Russian Empire was surpassed in size only by the British and Mongol empires . The rise of the Russian Empire coincided with the decline of neighboring rival powers : the Swedish Empire , the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , Persia and the Ottoman Empire . It played a major role in 1812-1814 in defeating Napoleon 's ambitions to control Europe and expanded to the west and south . The House of Romanov ruled the Russian Empire from 1721 until 1762 . Its matrilineal branch of patrilineal German descent , the House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov , ruled from 1762 to the end of the empire . At the beginning of the 19th century , the Russian Empire extended from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea in the south , from the Baltic Sea on the west into Alaska and Northern California in America on the east . With 125.6 million subjects registered by the 1897 census , it had the third-largest population in the world at the time , after Qing China and India . Like all empires , it featured great diversity in terms of economies , ethnicities , languages , and religion . There were many dissident elements that launched numerous rebellions and assassinations over the centuries . In the 19th century , they were closely watched by the imperial secret police , and thousands were exiled to Siberia . Economically , the empire was predominantly agricultural , with low productivity on large estates worked by Russian peasants , known as serfs , who were tied to the land in a feudal arrangement .",

Great Korean Empire ) was the last independent unified Korean state . Proclaimed in October 1897 by Emperor Gojong of the Joseon dynasty , the empire stood until Japan 's annexation of Korea in August 1910 . During the Korean Empire , Emperor Gojong oversaw the Gwangmu Reform , a partial modernization and Westernization of the military , economy , land system , and education system , and of various industries . In 1905 , Korea was made a colonial protectorate of Japan and in 1910 it was annexed by the country outright .",
  "/wiki/Mongol_Empire": "The Mongol Empire existed during the 13th and 14th centuries , and was the largest contiguous land empire in history . Originating in Mongolia , the Mongol Empire eventually stretched from Eastern Europe and parts of Central Europe to the Sea of Japan , extending northward into parts of Siberia ; eastward and southward into the Indian subcontinent , Mainland Southeast Asia and the Iranian Plateau ; and westward as far as the Levant and the Carpathian Mountains . The Mongol Empire emerged from the unification of several nomadic tribes in the Mongol homeland under the leadership of Genghis Khan ( c. 1162-1227 ) , whom a council proclaimed ruler of all the Mongols in 1206 . The empire grew rapidly under his rule and that of his descendants , who sent out invading armies in every direction . The vast transcontinental empire connected the East with the West in an enforced Pax Mongolica , allowing the dissemination and exchange of trade , technologies , commodities and ideologies across Eurasia . The empire began to split due to wars over succession , as the grandchildren of Genghis Khan disputed whether the royal line should follow from his son and initial heir \u00d6gedei or from one of his other sons , such as Tolui , Chagatai , or Jochi . The Toluids prevailed after a bloody purge of \u00d6gedeid and Chagataid factions , but disputes continued among the descendants of Tolui . A key reason for the split was the dispute over whether the Mongol Empire would become a sedentary , cosmopolitan empire , or would stay true to the Mongol nomadic and steppe-based lifestyle . After M\u00f6ngke Khan died ( 1259 ) , rival kurultai councils simultaneously elected different successors , the brothers Ariq B\u00f6ke and Kublai Khan , who fought each other in the Toluid Civil War ( 1260-1264 ) and also dealt with challenges from the descendants of other sons of Genghis . Kublai successfully took power , but civil war ensued as he sought unsuccessfully to regain control of the Chagatayid and \u00d6gedeid families . During the reigns of Genghis and \u00d6gedei , the Mongols suffered the occasional defeat when a less skilled general received a command . The Siberian Tumeds defeated the Mongol forces under Borokhula around 1215-1217 ; Jalal al-Din defeated Shigi-Qutugu at the Battle of Parwan in 1221 ; and the Jin generals Heda and Pu ' a defeated Dolqolqu in 1230 .",
  "/wiki/Imperial_Chinese": "The earliest known written records of the history of China date from as early as 1250 BC , from the Shang dynasty ( c. 1600-1046 BC ) , during the king Wu Ding 's reign , who was mentioned as the twenty-first Shang king by the same . Ancient historical texts such as the Records of the Grand Historian ( c. 100 BC ) and the Bamboo Annals ( 296 BC ) describe a Xia dynasty ( c. 2070-1600 BC ) before the Shang , but no writing is known from the period , and Shang writings do not indicate the existence of the Xia . The Shang ruled in the Yellow River valley , which is commonly held to be the cradle of Chinese civilization . However , Neolithic civilizations originated at various cultural centers along both the Yellow River and Yangtze River . These Yellow River and Yangtze civilizations arose millennia before the Shang . With thousands of years of continuous history , China is one of the world 's oldest civilizations , and is regarded as one of the cradles of civilization . The Zhou dynasty ( 1046-256 BC ) supplanted the Shang , and introduced the concept of the Mandate of Heaven to justify their rule . The central Zhou government began to weaken due to external and internal pressures in the 8th century BC , and the country eventually splintered into smaller states during the Spring and Autumn period . These states became independent and warred with one another in the following Warring States period . Much of traditional Chinese culture , literature and philosophy first developed during those troubled times . In 221 BC , Qin Shi Huang conquered the various warring states and created for himself the title of Huangdi or emperor of the Qin , marking the beginning of imperial China . However , the oppressive government fell soon after his death , and was supplanted by the longer-lived Han dynasty ( 206 BC - 220 AD ) .",
  "/wiki/First_French_Empire": "The First French Empire , officially the French Empire ( French : Empire Fran\u00e7ais ; Latin : Imperium Francicum ) , Note 1 was the empire of Napoleon Bonaparte of France and the dominant power in much of continental Europe at the beginning of the 19th century . Although France had already established an overseas colonial empire beginning in the 17th century , the French state had remained a kingdom under the Bourbons and a republic after the Revolution . Historians refer to Napoleon 's regime as the First Empire to distinguish it from the restorationist Second Empire ( 1852-1870 ) ruled by his nephew as Napoleon III . On 18 May 1804 , Napoleon was granted the title Emperor of the French ( L'Empereur des Fran\u00e7ais , pronounced [ l\u0251\u0303.p\u0281\u0153\u0281 de f\u0281\u0251\u0303.s\u025b ] ) by the French S\u00e9nat ( Senate ) and was crowned on 2 December 1804 , signifying the end of the French Consulate and of the French First Republic . The French Empire achieved military supremacy in mainland Europe through notable victories in the War of the Third Coalition against Austria , Prussia , Russia , and allied nations , notably at the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805 . French dominance was reaffirmed during the War of the Fourth Coalition , at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt in 1806 and the Battle of Friedland in 1807 . He was defeated during the 1815 battle of Waterloo . A series of wars , known collectively as the Napoleonic Wars , extended French influence to much of Western Europe and into Poland . At its height in 1812 , the French Empire had 130 departments , ruled over 70 million subjects , maintained an extensive military presence in Germany , Italy , Spain , and the Duchy of Warsaw , and counted Prussia and Austria as nominal allies . Early French victories exported many ideological features of the French Revolution throughout Europe : the introduction of the Napoleonic Code throughout the continent increased legal equality , established jury systems and legalised divorce , and seigneurial dues and seigneurial justice were abolished , as were aristocratic privileges in all places except Poland . France 's defeat in 1814 ( and then again in 1815 ) , marked the end of the Empire .",

Historians in the 1930s and 1940s often disparaged the Second Empire as a precursor of fascism . That interpretation is no longer promulgated and by the late 20th century they were celebrating it as leading example of a modernising regime . Historians have generally given the Empire negative evaluations on its foreign-policy , and somewhat more positive evaluations of domestic policies , especially after Napoleon III liberalised his rule after 1858 . He promoted French business and exports . The greatest achievements came in material improvements , in the form of a grand railway network that facilitated commerce and tied the nation together and centered it on Paris . It had the effect of stimulating economic growth , and bringing prosperity to most regions of the country . The Second Empire is given high credit for the rebuilding of Paris with broad boulevards , striking public buildings , and very attractive residential districts for upscale Parisians . In international policy , Napoleon III tried to emulate his uncle , engaging in numerous imperial ventures around the world as well as several wars in Europe . Using very harsh methods , he built up the French Empire in North Africa and in Southeast Asia . Napoleon III also sought to modernise the Mexican economy and bring it into the French orbit , but this ended in a fiasco . He badly mishandled the threat from Prussia , and by the end of his reign , Napoleon III found himself without allies in the face of overwhelming German force .",

  "/wiki/Empire_of_Brazil": "The Empire of Brazil was a 19th-century state that broadly comprised the territories which form modern Brazil and ( until 1828 ) Uruguay . Its government was a representative parliamentary constitutional monarchy under the rule of Emperors Dom Pedro I and his son Dom Pedro II . A colony of the Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil became the seat of the Portuguese colonial Empire in 1808 , when the Portuguese Prince regent , later King Dom Jo\u00e3o VI , fled from Napoleon 's invasion of Portugal and established himself and his government in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro . Jo\u00e3o VI later returned to Portugal , leaving his eldest son and heir , Pedro , to rule the Kingdom of Brazil as regent . On 7 September 1822 , Pedro declared the independence of Brazil and , after waging a successful war against his father 's kingdom , was acclaimed on 12 October as Pedro I , the first Emperor of Brazil . The new country was huge , sparsely populated and ethnically diverse . Unlike most of the neighboring Hispanic American republics , Brazil had political stability , vibrant economic growth , constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech , and respect for civil rights of its subjects , albeit with legal restrictions on women and slaves , the latter regarded as property and not citizens . The empire 's bicameral parliament was elected under comparatively democratic methods for the era , as were the provincial and local legislatures . This led to a long ideological conflict between Pedro I and a sizable parliamentary faction over the role of the monarch in the government . He faced other obstacles . The unsuccessful Cisplatine War against the neighboring United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata in 1828 led to the secession of the province of Cisplatina ( later to become Uruguay ) . In 1826 , despite his role in Brazilian independence , he became the king of Portugal ; he immediately abdicated the Portuguese throne in favor of his eldest daughter .",

Berlin remained its capital , and Otto , Prince of Bismarck , Minister-President of Prussia became Chancellor , the head of government . As these events occurred , the Prussian-led North German Confederation and its southern German allies were still engaged in the Franco-Prussian War . The German Empire consisted of 26 states , most of them ruled by royal families . They included four kingdoms , six grand duchies , five duchies ( six before 1876 ) , seven principalities , three free Hanseatic cities , and one imperial territory . Although Prussia was one of several kingdoms in the realm , it contained about two thirds of Germany 's population and territory . Prussian dominance had also been established constitutionally . After 1850 , the states of Germany had rapidly become industrialized , with particular strengths in coal , iron ( and later steel ) , chemicals , and railways . In 1871 , Germany had a population of 41 million people ; by 1913 , this had increased to 68 million .

  "/wiki/British_Empire": "The British Empire comprised the dominions , colonies , protectorates , mandates , and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states . It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries .

By 1913 , the British Empire held sway over 412 million people , 23% of the world population at the time , and by 1920 , it covered 35,500,000 km2 ( 13,700,000 sq mi ) , 24% of the Earth 's total land area . As a result , its political , legal , linguistic , and cultural legacy is widespread . At the peak of its power , the phrase the empire on which the sun never sets was often used to describe the British Empire , because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories . During the Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries , Portugal and Spain pioneered European exploration of the globe , and in the process established large overseas empires . Envious of the great wealth these empires generated , England , France , and the Netherlands began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the Americas and Asia . A series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France left England and then , following union between England and Scotland in 1707 , Great Britain , the dominant colonial power in North America .

In general the German title was only used for rulers over the rank of kings ( K\u00f6nig ) .

In English , the term the Kaiser is usually reserved for the emperors of the German Empire and the emperors of the Austrian Empire .

Vulgar Latin was the colloquial form spoken during the same time and attested in inscriptions and the works of comic playwrights like Plautus and Terence and author Petronius . Late Latin is the written language from the 3rd century and the colloquial form Vulgar Latin developed into the Romance languages , such as French , Italian , Portuguese , Romanian , Catalan and Spanish in the 6th to 9th centuries .

  "/wiki/King": "King , or king regnant , is the title given to a male monarch in a variety of contexts . The female equivalent is queen regnant , while the title of queen on its own usually refers to the consort of a king .",
  "/wiki/Queen_regnant": "A queen regnant ( plural : queens regnant ) is a female monarch , equivalent in rank to a king , who reigns in her own right , as opposed to a queen consort , who is the wife of a reigning king , or a queen regent , who is the guardian of a child monarch and reigns temporarily in the child 's stead . An empress regnant is a female monarch who reigns in her own right over an empire . A queen regnant possesses and exercises sovereign powers , whereas a queen consort shares her husband 's rank and titles , but does not share the sovereignty of her husband . The husband of a queen regnant traditionally does not share his wife 's rank , title or sovereignty . However , the concept of a king consort is not unheard of in both contemporary and classical periods . A queen dowager is the widow of a king . A queen mother is a queen dowager who is also the mother of a reigning sovereign .",
  "/wiki/Monarchy": "A monarchy is a form of government in which a person , the monarch , is head of state until death or abdication . The legitimation and governing power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic ( crowned republic ) , to restricted ( constitutional monarchy ) , to fully autocratic ( absolute monarchy ) , combining executive , legislative and judicial power . In most cases , the succession of monarchies is hereditary , but there are also elective and self-proclaimed monarchies , often building dynastic periods . Aristocrats , though not inherent to monarchies , often serve as the pool of persons to draw the monarch from and fill the constituting institutions ( e.g . diet and court ) , giving many monarchies oligarchic elements . A monarchy can be a polity through unity , personal union , vassalage or federation . Its authorities are proclaimed and recognized through the different seats , insignia and titles that a monarch can occupy and be invested with . For example , monarchs can carry titles such as king , queen , emperor , khan , caliph , tsar , or sultan , and can be bound to territories ( e.g. , the Emperor of Japan ) and peoples ( e.g. , the King of the Belgians ) . The republican form of government has been established as the opposing and main alternative to monarchy . Republics though have seen infringements through lifelong or even hereditary heads of state . Republics heads of state are often styled President or a variant thereof . Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 20th century .",
  "/wiki/Germanic_languages": "The Germanic languages are a branch of the Indo-European language family spoken natively by a population of about 515 million people [ nb 1 ] mainly in Europe , North America , Oceania and Southern Africa . The most widely spoken Germanic language , English , is the world 's most widely spoken language with an estimated 2 billion speakers . All Germanic languages are derived from Proto-Germanic , spoken in Iron Age Scandinavia . The West Germanic languages include the three most widely spoken Germanic languages : English with around 360-400 million native speakers ; [ nb 2 ] German , with over 100 million native speakers ; and Dutch , with 24 million native speakers . Other West Germanic languages include Afrikaans , an offshoot of Dutch , with over 7.1 million native speakers ; Low German , considered a separate collection of unstandardized dialects , with roughly 0.3 million native speakers and probably 6.7-10 million people who can understand it ( at least 5 million in Germany and 1.7 million in the Netherlands ) ; Yiddish , once used by approximately 13 million Jews in pre-World War II Europe , and Scots , both with 1.5 million native speakers ; Limburgish varieties with roughly 1.3 million speakers along the Dutch-Belgian-German border ; and the Frisian languages with over 0.5 million native speakers in the Netherlands and Germany . The largest North Germanic languages are Danish , Norwegian and Swedish , which are mutually intelligible and have a combined total of about 20 million native speakers in the Nordic countries and an additional five million second language speakers ; since the middle ages these languages have however been strongly influenced by the West Germanic language Middle Low German , and Low German words account for about 30-60% of their vocabularies according to various estimates . Other North Germanic languages are Faroese and Icelandic , which are more conservative languages with no significant Low German influence , more complex grammar and limited mutual intelligibility with the others today . The East Germanic branch included Gothic , Burgundian , and Vandalic , all of which are now extinct . The last to die off was Crimean Gothic , spoken until the late 18th century in some isolated areas of Crimea . The SIL Ethnologue lists 48 different living Germanic languages , 41 of which belong to the Western branch and six to the Northern branch ; it places Riograndenser Hunsr\u00fcckisch German in neither of the categories , but it is often considered a German dialect by linguists . The total number of Germanic languages throughout history is unknown as some of them , especially the East Germanic languages , disappeared during or after the Migration Period . Some of the West Germanic languages also did not survive past the Migration Period , including Lombardic .",

It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire , as did all Romance languages . French evolved from Gallo-Romance , the spoken Latin in Gaul , and more specifically in Northern Gaul . Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders . Today , owing to France 's past overseas expansion , there are numerous French-based creole languages , most notably Haitian Creole . A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French . French is an official language in 29 countries across multiple continents , most of which are members of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie ( OIF ) , the community of 84 countries which share the official use or teaching of French . It is spoken as a first language ( in descending order of the number of speakers ) in France , the Canadian provinces of Quebec , Ontario and New Brunswick as well as other Francophone regions , Belgium ( Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region ) , western Switzerland ( cantons of Bern , Fribourg , Geneva , Jura , Neuch\u00e2tel , Vaud , Valais ) , Monaco , partly in Luxembourg , the states of Louisiana , Maine , New Hampshire and Vermont in the United States , and in northwestern Italy ( region of Aosta Valley ) , and by various communities elsewhere .

In Ancient Greece , the city that founded a colony was known as the metropolis . Mother country is a reference to the metropolitan state from the point of view of citizens who live in its colony . There is a United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories . Unlike a puppet state or satellite state , a colony has no independent international representation , and its top-level administration is under direct control of the metropolitan state .

  "/wiki/City": "A city is a large human settlement . It can be defined as a permanent and densely settled place with administratively defined boundaries whose members work primarily on non-agricultural tasks . Cities generally have extensive systems for housing , transportation , sanitation , utilities , land use , and communication . Their density facilitates interaction between people , government organisations and businesses , sometimes benefiting different parties in the process , such as improving efficiency of goods and service distribution . This concentration also can have significant negative consequences , such as forming urban heat islands , concentrating pollution , and stressing water supplies and other resources . Historically , city-dwellers have been a small proportion of humanity overall , but following two centuries of unprecedented and rapid urbanisation , roughly half of the world population now lives in cities , which has had profound consequences for global sustainability . Present-day cities usually form the core of larger metropolitan areas and urban areas - creating numerous commuters traveling towards city centres for employment , entertainment , and edification . However , in a world of intensifying globalisation , all cities are in different degree also connected globally beyond these regions . This increased influence means that cities also have significant influences on global issues , such as sustainable development , global warming and global health . The world powers feature several renowned cities , the cities of the United States , include New York City and Los Angeles , and other major cities such as Chicago , Houston , and Philadelphia .

Its continental European territory is situated on the Iberian Peninsula . Its territory also includes two archipelagoes : the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa , and the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea . The African enclaves of Ceuta , Melilla , and Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera make Spain the only European country to have a physical border with an African country ( Morocco ) . [ h ] Several small islands in the Alboran Sea are also part of Spanish territory . The country 's mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar ; to the north and northeast by France , Andorra , and the Bay of Biscay ; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean . With an area of 505,990 km2 ( 195,360 sq mi ) , Spain is the largest country in Southern Europe , the second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union , and the fourth largest country in the European continent .

The Viceroyalty was established in 1776 from several former Viceroyalty of Per\u00fa dependencies that mainly extended over the R\u00edo de la Plata Basin , roughly the present-day territories of Argentina , Chile , Bolivia , Paraguay and Uruguay , extending inland from the Atlantic Coast . The colony of Spanish Guinea ( present-day Equatorial Guinea ) also depended administratively on the Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata . Buenos Aires , located on the western shore of the R\u00edo de la Plata estuary flowing into the Atlantic Ocean , opposite the Portuguese outpost of Colonia del Sacramento , was chosen as the capital . Usually considered one of the late Bourbon Reforms , the organization of this viceroyalty was motivated on both commercial grounds ( Buenos Aires was by then a major spot for illegal trade ) , as well as on security concerns brought about by the growing interest of competing foreign powers in the area . The Spanish Crown wanted to protect its territory against Great Britain and the Kingdom of Portugal . But these Enlightenment reforms proved counterproductive , or perhaps too late , to quell the colonies ' demands . The entire history of this Viceroyalty was marked by growing domestic unrest and political instability . Between 1780 and 1782 , the Rebellion of T\u00fapac Amaru II inspired a violent Aymara-led revolt across the Upper Peru highlands , demonstrating the great resentment against colonial authorities by both the mestizo and indigenous populations . Twenty-five years later , the Criollos , native-born people of the colony , successfully defended against two successive British attempts to conquer Buenos Aires and Montevideo . This enhanced their sense of autonomy and power at a time when Spanish troops were unable to help . In 1809 , the Criollo elite revolted against colonial authorities at La Paz and Chuquisaca , establishing revolutionary governments , juntas .",

  "/wiki/Portuguese_Empire": "The Portuguese Empire ( Portuguese : Imp\u00e9rio Portugu\u00eas ) , also known as the Portuguese Overseas ( Ultramar Portugu\u00eas ) or the Portuguese Colonial Empire ( Imp\u00e9rio Colonial Portugu\u00eas ) , was composed of the overseas colonies and territories governed by Portugal . One of the longest-lived empires in world history , it existed for almost six centuries , from the capture of Ceuta in 1415 , to the handover of Portuguese Macau to China in 1999 . The empire began in the 15th century , and from the early 16th century it stretched across the globe , with bases in North and South America , Africa , and various regions of Asia and Oceania . The Portuguese Empire originated at the beginning of the Age of Discovery , and the power and influence of the Kingdom of Portugal would eventually expand across the globe . In the wake of the Reconquista , Portuguese sailors began exploring the coast of Africa and the Atlantic archipelagos in 1418-19 , using recent developments in navigation , cartography and maritime technology such as the caravel , with the aim of finding a sea route to the source of the lucrative spice-trade . In 1488 Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope , and in 1498 Vasco da Gama reached India . In 1500 , either by an accidental landfall or by the crown 's secret design , Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral discovered Brazil on the South American coast . Over the following decades , Portuguese sailors continued to explore the coasts and islands of East Asia , establishing forts and factories as they went . By 1571 a string of naval outposts connected Lisbon to Nagasaki along the coasts of Africa , the Middle East , India and South Asia . This commercial network and the colonial trade had a substantial positive impact on Portuguese economic growth ( 1500-1800 ) , when it accounted for about a fifth of Portugal 's per-capita income . When King Philip II of Spain ( Philip I of Portugal ) seized the Portuguese crown in 1580 there began a 60-year union between Spain and Portugal known to subsequent historiography as the Iberian Union . The realms continued to have separate administrations .",

The first viceroy , Francisco de Almeida , established his headquarters in Cochin ( Cochim , Kochi ) . ( Subsequent Portuguese governors were not always of viceroy rank . ) After 1510 , the capital of the Portuguese viceroyalty was transferred to Goa . Bombay ( present-day Mumbai ) was part of Portuguese India until ceded to the British in 1661 . Until the 18th century , the Portuguese governor in Goa had authority over all Portuguese possessions in the Indian Ocean , from southern Africa to southeast Asia . In 1752 Mozambique got its own separate government and in 1844 the Portuguese Government of India stopped administering the territory of Macau , Solor and Timor , and its authority was confined to the colonial holdings on the Malabar Coast of present-day India . At the time of the British Indian Empire 's dissolution in 1947 , Portuguese India was subdivided into three districts located on modern-day India 's western coast , sometimes referred to collectively as Goa : namely Goa ; Dam\u00e3o , which included the inland enclaves of Dadra and Nagar Haveli ; and Diu . Portugal lost effective control of the enclaves of Dadra and Nagar Haveli in 1954 , and finally the rest of the overseas territory in December 1961 , when it was annexed by India .

The office was created in 1773 , with the title of Governor-general of the Presidency of Fort William . The officer had direct control only over Fort William , but supervised other East India Company officials in India . Complete authority over all of British India was granted in 1833 , and the official came to be known as the governor-general of India . In 1858 , as a consequence of the Indian Rebellion the previous year , the territories and assets of the East India Company came under the direct control of the British Crown ; as a consequence the Company Raj was succeeded by the British Raj . The Governor-General ( now also the Viceroy ) headed the central government of India , which administered the provinces of British India , including the Punjab , Bengal , Bombay , Madras , the United Provinces , and others . However , much of India was not ruled directly by the British Government ; outside the provinces of British India , there were hundreds of nominally independent princely states or native states , whose relationship was not with the British Government or the United Kingdom , but rather one of homage directly with the British Monarch as sovereign successor to the Mughal Emperors . From 1858 , to reflect the Governor-General 's new additional role as the Monarch 's representative in re the fealty relationships vis the princely states , the additional title of Viceroy was granted , such that the new office was entitled viceroy and governor-general of India . This was usually shortened to viceroy of India . The title of viceroy was abandoned when British India split into the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan , but the office of governor-general continued to exist in each country separately - until they adopted republican constitutions in 1950 and 1956 , respectively . Until 1858 , the governor-general was selected by the Court of Directors of the East India Company , to whom he was responsible . Thereafter , he was appointed by the sovereign on the advice of the British Government ; the secretary of state for India , a member of the UK Cabinet , was responsible for instructing him or her on the exercise of their powers .",

The genesis of the Italian colonial empire was the purchase in 1869 of Assab Bay on the Red Sea by an Italian navigation company which intended to establish a coaling station at the time the Suez Canal was being opened to navigation . This was taken over by the Italian government in 1882 , becoming modern Italy 's first overseas territory . Over the next two decades , the pace of European acquisitions in Africa increased , causing the so-called Scramble for Africa . By the start of the First World War in 1914 , Italy had acquired in Africa the colony of Eritrea on the Red Sea coast , a large protectorate and later colony in Somalia , and authority in formerly Ottoman Tripolitania and Cyrenaica ( gained after the Italo-Turkish War ) which were later unified in the colony of Libya . Outside Africa , Italy possessed the Dodecanese Islands off the coast of Turkey ( following the Italo-Turkish War ) and a concession in Tianjin in China ( following the Boxer War ) . During the First World War , Italy occupied southern Albania to prevent it from falling to Austria-Hungary . In 1917 , it established a protectorate over Albania , which remained in place until 1920 . The Fascist government that came to power with Benito Mussolini in 1922 sought to increase the size of the Italian empire and to satisfy the claims of Italian irredentists . In its second invasion of Ethiopia in 1935-36 , Italy was successful and it merged its new conquest with its older east African colonies to create Italian East Africa . In 1939 , Italy invaded Albania and incorporated it into the Fascist state . During the Second World War ( 1939-1945 ) , Italy occupied British Somaliland , parts of south-eastern France , western Egypt and most of Greece , but then lost those conquests and its African colonies , including Ethiopia , to the invading allied forces by 1943 .",

In the late Roman Empire and early Byzantine Empire , an exarch was a governor of a particular territory . From the end of 3rd century or early 4th , every Roman diocese was governed by vicarius who was titled exarch in eastern parts of the Empire where the Greek language and the use of Greek terminology dominated , even though Latin was the language of the imperial administration from the provincial level up until the 440s ( Greek translations were sent out with the official Latin text ) . In Greek texts the Latin title is spelled 'Bicarios . ' The office of exarch as a governor with extended political and military authority was later created in Byzantine Empire , with jurisdiction over a particular territory , usually a frontier region at some distance from the capital Constantinople . In the Eastern Christian Churches ( Eastern Orthodox , Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Catholic ) , the term exarch has three distinct uses : metropolitan who holds the office of exarch is the deputy of a patriarch and holds authority over bishops of the designated ecclesiastical region ( thus , a position between that of patriarch and regular metropolitan ) ; or , an auxiliary or titular bishop appointed to be exarch over a group of the faithful not yet large enough or organized enough to be constituted an eparchy or diocese ( thus the equivalent of a vicar apostolic ) ; and , a priest or deacon who is appointed by a bishop as his executive representative in various fields of diocesan administration ( in the Byzantine Empire , executive exarchs were usually collecting diocesan revenues for local bishops ) .",

The throne of the Holy Roman Empire was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs from 1438 until their extinction in the male line in 1740 . The house also produced kings of Bohemia , Hungary , Croatia , Galicia , Portugal and Spain with their respective colonies , as well as rulers of several principalities in the Netherlands and Italy . From the 16th century , following the reign of Charles V , the dynasty was split between its Austrian and Spanish branches . Although they ruled distinct territories , they nevertheless maintained close relations and frequently intermarried . The House takes its name from Habsburg Castle , a fortress built in the 1020s in present-day Switzerland , in the canton of Aargau , by Count Radbot of Klettgau , who named his fortress Habsburg . His grandson Otto II was the first to take the fortress name as his own , adding Count of Habsburg to his title . The House of Habsburg gathered dynastic momentum through the 11th , 12th , and 13th centuries . In 1273 , Count Radbot 's seventh generation descendant Rudolph of Habsburg became Roman-German King . He moved the family 's power base to the Duchy of Austria , which the Habsburgs ruled until 1918 . A series of dynastic marriages enabled the family to vastly expand its domains to include Burgundy , Spain and its colonial empire , Bohemia , Hungary , and other territories . In the 16th century , the family separated into the senior Spanish and the junior Austrian branches , who settled their mutual claims in the O\u00f1ate treaty .",

It is composed of nine federated states ( Bundesl\u00e4nder ) , one of which is Vienna , Austria 's capital and its largest city . It is bordered by Germany to the northwest , Czech Republic to the north , Slovakia to the northeast , Hungary to the east , Slovenia and Italy to the south , and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west . Austria occupies an area of 83,879 km2 ( 32,386 sq mi ) and has a population of nearly 9 million people . While German is the country 's official language , many Austrians communicate informally in a variety of Bavarian dialects . Austria initially emerged as a margraviate around 976 and developed into a duchy and archduchy . In the 16th century , Austria started serving as the heart of the Habsburg Monarchy and the junior branch of the House of Habsburg - one of the most influential royal dynasties in history . As an archduchy , it was a major component and administrative centre of the Holy Roman Empire . Early in the 19th century , Austria established its own empire , which became a great power and the leading force of the German Confederation but pursued its own course independently of the other German states . Following the Austro-Prussian War and the compromise with Hungary , the Dual Monarchy was established . Austria was involved in World War I under Emperor Franz Joseph following the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand , the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne . After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy , the Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed with the intent of the union with Germany , which eventually failed because of the Allied Powers and the state remained unrecognized .",

Relatively rare until the abolition of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 , the term was often used in the official name of countries smaller than most continental kingdoms of modern Europe ( e.g. , Denmark , Spain , United Kingdom ) yet larger than most of the sovereign duchies in the Holy Roman Empire , Italy or Scandinavia ( e.g . Anhalt , Lorraine , Modena , Schleswig-Holstein ) . During the 19th century there were as many as 14 grand duchies in Europe at once ( a few of which were first created as exclaves of the Napoleonic empire but later re-created , usually with different borders , under another dynasty ) . Some of these were sovereign and nominally independent ( Baden , Hesse and by Rhine , Mecklenburg-Schwerin , Mecklenburg-Strelitz , Oldenburg , Saxe-Weimar and Tuscany ) , some sovereign but held in personal union with larger realms by a monarch whose grand-dukedom was borne as a subsidiary title ( Finland , Luxembourg , Transylvania ) , some of which were client states of a more powerful realm ( Cleves and Berg ) , and some whose territorial boundaries were nominal and the position purely titular ( Frankfurt ) .

Its capital , Luxembourg City , is one of the four official capitals of the European Union ( together with Brussels , Frankfurt , and Strasbourg ) and the seat of the European Court of Justice , the highest judicial authority in the EU . Its culture , people , and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbours , making it essentially a mixture of French and German cultures , as evident by the nation 's three official languages : French , German , and the national language of Luxembourgish . The repeated invasions by Germany , especially in World War II , resulted in the country 's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and , among other things , led to the foundation of the European Union . With an area of 2,586 square kilometres ( 998 sq mi ) , it is one of the smallest sovereign states in Europe . In 2019 , Luxembourg had a population of 613,894 , which makes it one of the least-populous countries in Europe , but by far the one with the highest population growth rate . Foreigners account for nearly half of Luxembourg 's population . As a representative democracy with a constitutional monarch , it is headed by Grand Duke Henri and is the world 's only remaining sovereign grand duchy . Luxembourg is a developed country , with an advanced economy and one of the world 's highest GDP ( PPP ) per capita .

The state originated with the Mongol invasion of Rus ' , at which point Daniel I was appointed to the newly-created Moscow in 1283 as effectively a puppet to the Mongol Empire ( under the Tatar Yoke ) , the latter of which had eclipsed and eventually absorbed its parent duchy of Vladimir-Suzdal by the 1320s . It later annexed the Novgorod Republic in 1478 and conquered the Grand Duchy of Tver in 1485 , and ultimately remained ruled by the Mongols for most of its history until 1480 . Muscovites , Suzdalians and other inhabitants of the Rus ' principality were able to maintain their Slavic , Pagan and Orthodox traditions for the most part under the Tatar Yoke . Ivan III further consolidated the state during his 43-year reign , campaigning against his major remaining rival power , the Grand Duchy of Lithuania , and by 1503 he had tripled the territory of his realm , adopting the title of tsar and claiming the title of Ruler of all Rus ' . By his marriage to the niece of the last Byzantine emperor , he claimed Muscovy to be the successor state of the Roman Empire , the Third Rome . The emigration of the Byzantine people influenced and strengthened Moscow 's identity as the heir of the Orthodox traditions . Ivan 's successor Vasili III also enjoyed military success , gaining Smolensk from Lithuania in 1512 , pushing Muscovy 's borders to the Dniepr River . Vasili 's son Ivan IV ( later known as Ivan the Terrible ) was an infant at his father 's death in 1533 .

The Grand Duke of Finland was the Romanov Emperor of Russia , who was represented by the Governor-General . Due to the governmental structure of the Russian Empire and Finnish initiative , the grand duchy 's autonomy expanded until the end of the 19th century . The Senate of Finland was founded in 1809 , which became the most important governmental organ and the precursor to the modern Government of Finland , Supreme Court of Finland and the Supreme Administrative Court of Finland . The economic , social and political changes in the Grand Duchy of Finland were closely connected with those in the Russian Empire and the rest of Europe . The economy grew slowly during the first half of the 19th century . The reign of Alexander II after 1855 saw significant cultural , social and intellectual progress and an industrializing economy . Tensions increased after the Russification policies were enacted in 1889 , which saw the introduction of limited autonomy and reduction of Finnish cultural expression .

The grand duchy 's capital was Florence . Tuscany was nominally a state of the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797 . Initially , Tuscany was ruled by the House of Medici until the extinction of its senior branch in 1737 . While not as internationally renowned as the old republic , the grand duchy thrived under the Medici and it bore witness to unprecedented economic and military success under Cosimo I and his sons , until the reign of Ferdinando II , which saw the beginning of the state 's long economic decline . It peaked under Cosimo III . The Medicis ' only advancement in the latter days of their existence was their elevation to royalty , by the Holy Roman Emperor , in 1691 .

  "/wiki/Duchy": "A duchy is a medieval country , territory , fief , or domain ruled by a duke or duchess , a high-ranking nobleman hierarchically second to the king or queen in European tradition . The term is used almost exclusively in Europe , where in the present day there is no sovereign duchy ( i.e . with the status of a nation state ) left . The term duke ( like the corresponding duchy ) should not be confused with the title Grand Duke ( or Grand Duchy , such as the present-day Grand Duchy of Luxembourg ) , as there exists a significant difference of rank between the two . In common European cultural heritage , a grand duke is the third highest monarchic rank , after emperor and king . Its synonym in many Slavic and Baltic European languages ( Russian , Lithuanian , etc . ) is translated as Grand Prince , whereas most Germanic and Romance European languages ( English , French , Spanish , Italian etc . ) use expressions corresponding to Grand Duke . Unlike a duke , the sovereign grand duke is considered royalty ( or in German , 'royal nobility ' , K\u00f6nigsadel ) . The proper form of address for a grand duke is His Royal Highness ( HRH ) , whereas for a non-royal duke in the United Kingdom it is His Grace . In contrast to this , the rank of a duke differs from one country to the next . In Germany , for example , a duke is listed in the aristocratic hierarchy below an emperor ( Kaiser ) , king ( K\u00f6nig ) , grand duke ( Gro\u00dfherzog ) , and elector ( Kurf\u00fcrst ) - in that order - whereas in Britain the duke comes third after king/queen and prince ( there are no British grand dukes or electors ) .",

The current duke is Charles , Prince of Wales . If , and when , the current Prince of Wales accedes to the throne , Prince William will become Duke of Cornwall . When the monarch has no male children , the rights and responsibilities of the duchy revert to the Crown and there is no duke .

The Prince 's Council is a non-executive body which provides advice to the duke with regard to the management of the Duchy . The duchy also exercises certain legal rights and privileges across Cornwall , including some that elsewhere in England belong to the Crown . The duke appoints a number of officials in the county and acts as the port authority for the main harbour of the Isles of Scilly .

In 1202 , Philip II of France declared Normandy forfeit to him and seized it by force of arms in 1204 . It remained disputed territory until the Treaty of Paris of 1259 , when the English sovereign ceded his claim except for the Channel Islands ; i.e. , the Bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey , and their dependencies ( including Sark ) . In the Kingdom of France , the duchy was occasionally set apart as an appanage to be ruled by a member of the royal family . After 1469 , however , it was permanently united to the royal domain , although the title was occasionally conferred as an honorific upon junior members of the royal family .

It was the first Protestant state when Albert , Duke of Prussia formally adopted Lutheranism as early as 1525 . It was inhabited by a German , Polish ( mainly in Masuria ) and Lithuanian-speaking ( mainly in Lithuania Minor ) population . In old texts and in Latin , the term Prut ( h ) enia refers alike to Ducal Prussia , and the breakaway province of Royal Prussia , and their common predecessor , Teutonic Prussia . The adjectival form of the name was Prut ( h ) enic . In 1525 during the Protestant Reformation , in accordance to the Treaty of Krak\u00f3w , the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights , Albert , secularized the order 's Prussian territory , becoming Albert , Duke of Prussia .

  "/wiki/Princely_state": "A princely state , also called native state , feudatory state or Indian state ( for those states on the subcontinent ) , was a vassal state under a local or indigenous or regional ruler in a subsidiary alliance with the British Raj . Though the history of the princely states of the subcontinent dates from at least the classical period of Indian history , the predominant usage of the term princely state specifically refers to a semi-sovereign principality on the Indian subcontinent during the British Raj that was not directly governed by the British , but rather by a local ruler , subject to a form of indirect rule on some matters . The imprecise doctrine of paramountcy allowed the government of British India to interfere in the internal affairs of princely states individually or collectively and issue edicts that applied to all of India when it deemed it necessary . At the time of the British withdrawal , 565 princely states were officially recognised in the Indian subcontinent , apart from thousands of zamindari estates and jagirs . In 1947 , princely states covered 40% of the area of pre-independence India and constituted 23% of its population . The most important states had their own British Political Residencies : Hyderabad , Mysore and Travancore in the South followed by Jammu and Kashmir , and Sikkim in the Himalayas , and Indore in Central India . The most prominent among those - roughly a quarter of the total - had the status of a salute state , one whose ruler was entitled to a set number of gun salutes on ceremonial occasions . The princely states varied greatly in status , size , and wealth ; the premier 21-gun salute states of Hyderabad , and Jammu and Kashmir were each over 200,000 km2 ( 77,000 sq mi ) in size .

At the other end of the scale , the non-salute principality of Lawa covered an area of 49 km2 ( 19 sq mi ) , with a population of just below 3,000 .

It has been called the smallest sovereign state in the world , though it is not recognized as one by the United Nations . SMOM claims continuity with the Knights Hospitaller , a chivalric order that was founded c. 1099 by the Blessed Gerard in medieval Jerusalem . In terms of international law , it is an establishment of the 19th century , recognized at the Congress of Verona of 1822 , and since 1834 headquartered in Palazzo Malta in Rome . The order is led by an elected Prince and Grand Master . Its motto is Tuitio fidei et obsequium pauperum ( 'defence of the faith and assistance to the poor ' ) . The order venerates the Virgin Mary as its patroness , under the title of Our Lady of Mount Philermos . The headquarters of the Order of Saint John had been located in Malta from 1530 until 1798 . It was technically a vassal of the Kingdom of Sicily , holding Malta in exchange for a nominal fee , but declared independence in 1753 . It was expelled from Malta under the French occupation in 1798 and , from 1805 to 1812 , much of its possessions in Protestant Europe were confiscated , resulting in the fragmentation of the order into a number of Protestant branches , since 1961 united under the umbrella of the Alliance of the Orders of Saint John of Jerusalem . The Congress of Vienna of 1815 confirmed the loss of Malta , but the Congress of Verona in 1822 guaranteed the continued existence of the Catholic order as a sovereign entity . The seat of the order was moved to Ferrara in 1826 and to Rome in 1834 , the interior of Palazzo Malta being considered extraterritorial sovereign territory of the order .",

Its capital , Belgrade , ranks among the largest citi\u0435s in southeastern Europe . Inhabited since the Paleolithic Age , the territory of modern-day Serbia faced Slavic migrations to Southeastern Europe in the 6th century , establishing several regional states in the early Middle Ages at times recognised as tributaries to the Byzantine , Frankish and Hungarian kingdoms . The Serbian Kingdom obtained recognition by the Holy See and Constantinople in 1217 , reaching its territorial apex in 1346 as the relatively short-lived Serbian Empire . By the mid-16th century , the Ottomans annexed the entirety of modern-day Serbia ; their rule was at times interrupted by the Habsburg Empire , which began expanding towards Central Serbia from the end of the 17th century while maintaining a foothold in Vojvodina . In the early 19th century , the Serbian Revolution established the nation-state as the region 's first constitutional monarchy , which subsequently expanded its territory . Following disastrous casualties in World War I , and the subsequent unification of the former Habsburg crownland of Vojvodina ( and other lands ) with Serbia , the country co-founded Yugoslavia with other South Slavic peoples , which would exist in various political formations until the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s . During the breakup of Yugoslavia , Serbia formed a union with Montenegro , which was peacefully dissolved in 2006 and restoring Serbia 's independence as a sovereign state for the first time since the late 1910s . In 2008 , the parliament of the province of Kosovo unilaterally declared independence , with mixed responses from the international community .",
  "/wiki/Micronation": "A micronation is a political entity whose members claim that they belong to an independent nation or sovereign state lacking legal recognition by world governments or major international organizations . Most are geographically very small , but range in size from a single square foot to millions of square miles ( Westarctica ) . They are usually the outgrowth of a single individual . A micronation expresses a formal and persistent if unrecognized claim of sovereignty over some physical territory . Micronations are distinct from true secessionist movements ; micronations ' activities are almost always trivial enough to be ignored rather than challenged by the established nations whose territory they claim . Several micronations have issued coins , flags , postage stamps , passports , medals and other state-related items , often as a source of revenue . Some of what might now be considered micronations began in the 20th century . The advent of the Internet provided the means for people to create many new micronations , whose members are scattered all over the world and interact mostly by electronic means , often calling their nations nomadic countries . The differences between such Internet micronations , other kinds of social networking groups and role-playing games are often difficult to define . The term micronation to describe those entities dates at least to the 1970s . The term micropatriology is sometimes used to describe the study of both micronations and microstates by micronationalists , some of whom refer to sovereign nation-states as macronations . Micronations contrast with microstates , which are small but recognized sovereign states such as Andorra , Liechtenstein , Luxembourg , Monaco , San Marino and Vatican City .",

  "/wiki/County": "A county is a geographical region of a country used for administrative or other purposes , in certain modern nations . The term is derived from the Old French cont\u00e9 or cunt\u00e9 denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count ( earl ) or a viscount . The modern French is comt\u00e9 , and its equivalents in other languages are contea , contado , comtat , condado , Grafschaft , graafschap , Gau , etc . ( compare conte , comte , conde , Graf ) . When the Normans conquered England , they brought the term with them . The Saxons had already established the districts that became the historic counties of England , calling them shires ; many county names derive from the name of the county town ( county seat ) with the word shire added on : for example , Gloucestershire and Worcestershire . The Anglo-Saxon terms earl and earldom were taken as equivalent to the continental terms count and county under the conquering Normans , and over time the two blended and became equivalent . Further , the later-imported term became a synonym for the native Old English word s\u010b\u012br ( [ \u0283i\u02d0r ] ) or , in Modern English , shire . Since a shire was an administrative division of the kingdom , the term county evolved to designate an administrative division of a federal state , as in Germany and the United States , or of a national government in most other modern uses . In the United States and Canada , founded 600 years later [ a ] on the British traditions , counties are usually an administrative division set by convenient geographical demarcations , which in governance have certain officeholders ( for example sheriffs and their departments ) as a part of the state and provincial mechanisms , including geographically common court systems .

Norse Vikings probably either came to the islands first as farmers seeking land or as warriors who were claiming territory and riches , or both , as was common with Viking conquests elsewhere . The question of whether the Picts were completely massacred by the settling Vikings , migrated away , or were gradually assimilated , in peaceful coexistence , is a matter of contention . However , aside from traces of their lives there , their culture did not endure in the early history or character of Orkney .

The head of state , Queen Elizabeth II , holds the title of Lord of Mann and is represented by a lieutenant governor . Defence is the responsibility of the United Kingdom . Humans have lived on the island since before 6500 BC . Gaelic cultural influence began in the 5th century AD , and the Manx language , a branch of the Gaelic languages , emerged . In 627 Edwin of Northumbria conquered the Isle of Man along with most of Mercia . In the 9th century , Norsemen established the Kingdom of the Isles , which included the Isle of Man . Magnus III , King of Norway from 1093 to 1103 , reigned also as King of Mann and the Isles between 1099 and 1103 . In 1266 the island became part of Scotland under the Treaty of Perth , after being ruled by Norway . After a period of alternating rule by the kings of Scotland and England , the island came under the feudal lordship of the English Crown in 1399 . The lordship revested into the British Crown in 1765 , but the island never became part of the 18th century kingdom of Great Britain or its successors ( the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the present-day United Kingdom ) . It retained its internal self-government .",
  "/wiki/Lordship_of_Ireland": "The Lordship of Ireland ( Irish : Tiarnas na h\u00c9ireann ) , sometimes referred to retroactively as Norman Ireland , was the part of Ireland ruled by the King of England ( styled as Lord of Ireland ) and controlled by loyal Anglo-Norman lords between 1177 and 1542 . The lordship was created as a Papal fief following the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169-1171 . As the lord of Ireland was also the king of England , he was represented locally by a governor , variously known as justiciar , lieutenant , or Lord Deputy . The kings of England claimed lordship over the whole island , but in reality the king 's rule only ever extended to parts of the island . The rest of the island - known as Gaelic Ireland - remained under the control of various Gaelic Irish kingdoms or chiefdoms , who were often at war with the Anglo-Normans . The area under English rule and law grew and shrank over time , and reached its greatest extent in the late 13th and early 14th centuries . The lordship then went into decline , brought on by its invasion by Scotland in 1315-18 , the Great Famine of 1315-17 , and the Black Death of the 1340s . The fluid political situation and English feudal system allowed a great deal of autonomy for the Anglo-Norman lords in Ireland , who carved out earldoms for themselves and had almost as much authority as some of the native Gaelic kings . Some Anglo-Normans became Gaelicised and rebelled against the English administration . The English attempted to curb this by passing the Statutes of Kilkenny ( 1366 ) , which forbade English settlers from taking up Irish law , language , custom and dress . The period ended with the creation of the Kingdom of Ireland in 1542 .",
  "/wiki/Lord_of_the_Isles": "The Lord of the Isles ( Scottish Gaelic : Triath nan Eilean or R\u00ecgh Innse Gall ) is a title of Scottish nobility with historical roots that go back beyond the Kingdom of Scotland . It emerged from a series of hybrid Viking/Gaelic rulers of the west coast and islands of Scotland in the Middle Ages , who wielded sea-power with fleets of galleys ( birlinns ) . Although they were , at times , nominal vassals of the Kings of Norway , Ireland , or Scotland , the island chiefs remained functionally independent for many centuries . Their territory included the Hebrides ( Skye and Ross from 1438 ) , Knoydart , Ardnamurchan , and the Kintyre peninsula . At their height they were the greatest landowners and most powerful lords in Britain after the Kings of England and Scotland . The end of the MacDonald Lords came in 1493 when MacDonald II had his ancestral homeland , estates , and titles seized by King James IV of Scotland . Since that time , the MacDonald Clan has contested the right of James IV to the Lordship of the Isles and uprisings and rebellions against the Scottish Monarch were common . More recently , the Lordship of the Isles has been held by the Duke of Rothesay , the eldest son and heir apparent of the King of Scotland , a title which , since the creation of the Kingdom of Great Britain , is borne by the Prince of Wales . Thus Prince Charles is the current Lord of the Isles . Finlaggan on Islay was the seat of the Lords of the Isles under Clan Donald .",

Following the end of European feudalism , feudal baronies have largely been superseded by baronies held as a rank of nobility , without any attachment to a fief . However , in Scotland , the feudal dignity of baron remains in existence , and may be bought and sold independently of the land to which it was formerly attached .",
  "/wiki/Barony_of_Kendal": "The Barony of Kendal is a subdivision of the English historic county of Westmorland . It is one of two ancient baronies that make up the county , the other being the Barony of Westmorland ( also known as North Westmorland , or the Barony of Appleby ) . In 1974 , the entire county became part of the modern county of Cumbria and ceased to have an administrative function . At the same time , Kendal borough along with some other rural and urban districts in Westmorland was merged with the neighbouring parts of Lancashire , Furness and Cartmel , and also the Sedbergh Rural District of the West Riding of Yorkshire into the new South Lakeland district of the new county . The barony is the remnant of the feudal barony whose caput was at Kendal castle . The feudal barony had its own complex evolution , determined by the evolution of the families that owned it . For some purposes , it was therefore once considered to include parts of the Barony of Westmorland that were possessed by the original lords of Kendal , such as at least parts of the ancient parishes of Barton St Michael , and Morland . In modern times , before it was scrapped , the barony came to be divided into two administrative wards , Kendal and Lonsdale , centred on the old church towns of Kendal ( sometimes referred to historically as Kirkby Kendal ) , and Kirkby Lonsdale , which are respectively geographically centred on the valleys ( dales ) of the rivers Kent and Lune . The parishes of the two wards are as follows :",

  "/wiki/Lordship_and_Barony_of_Hailes": "The Lordship and Barony of Hailes is a Scottish feudal lordship ( a feudal barony of higher degree ) . Hailes is traditionally believed to have been founded by an Englishman , taken prisoner in the reign of David II of Scotland , who was rewarded with the grant of lands in East Lothian for having rescued the Earl of Dunbar and March from an attacking horse . Patrick de Dunbar , 9th Earl of March granted the Barony of Hailes to Adam de Hepburn ( or Hibburne or Hyburne ) in 1343 ( thus the Hepburns held Hailes in heritage from the Earl of March , who in turn held it on behalf of the Crown ) ; Hew Gourlay of Beinstoun having earlier forfeited the lands . On 20 December 1451 , James II , King of Scots , granted Sir Patrick Hepburn , 1st Lord Hailes , and his heirs and assignees , the lands of the Lordship of Hailes , including Hailes Castle , and other lands , to be incorporated into the free barony of Hailes . Sir Patrick Hepburn was created a peer of the Parliament of Scotland under the title Lord Hailes in 1453 . The Lordship and Barony of Hailes remained in the Hepburn family until 20 December 1567 when it was forfeited to the Parliament of Scotland by James Hepburn , 4th Earl of Bothwell . On 1 October 1594 , it was granted to Sir Walter Scott , 1st Lord Scott of Buccleuch , remaining with the Scott family until around the time of the Cromwellian invasion of Scotland in 1650 when it came into the possession of the Earls of Winton . In 1692 , the Lordship and Barony of Hailes was disponed by James Melville of Halhill to Sir David Dalrymple , advocate and remained in the Dalrymple family until 1876 when it was transferred to A.J .

It is bordered by Romania to the north , Serbia and North Macedonia to the west , Greece and Turkey to the south , and the Black Sea to the east . The capital and largest city is Sofia ; other major cities are Plovdiv , Varna and Burgas . With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres ( 42,855 sq mi ) , Bulgaria is Europe 's 16th-largest country . One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC . In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians , Persians , Celts and ancient Macedonians ; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45 . The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries . The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State .",

It is situated north of the Lower Danube and south of the Southern Carpathians . Wallachia is traditionally divided into two sections , Muntenia ( Greater Wallachia ) and Oltenia ( Lesser Wallachia ) . Wallachia as a whole is sometimes referred to as Muntenia through identification with the larger of the two traditional sections . Wallachia was founded as a principality in the early 14th century by Basarab I , after a rebellion against Charles I of Hungary , although the first mention of the territory of Wallachia west of the river Olt dates to a charter given to the voivode Seneslau in 1246 by B\u00e9la IV of Hungary . In 1417 , Wallachia accepted the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire ; this lasted until the 19th century , albeit with brief periods of Russian occupation between 1768 and 1854 . In 1859 , Wallachia united with Moldavia to form the United Principalities , which adopted the name Romania in 1866 and officially became the Kingdom of Romania in 1881 . Later , following the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the resolution of the elected representatives of Romanians in 1918 , Bukovina , Transylvania as well as parts of Banat , Cri\u0219ana , and Maramure\u0219 were allocated to the Kingdom of Romania , thereby forming the modern Romanian state .",

Today the nobility does not maintain its former privileges although family names , titles and coats of arms are still protected . The Swedish nobility consists of both introduced and unintroduced nobility , where the latter has not been formally introduced at the House of Nobility ( Riddarhuset ) . The House of Nobility still maintains a fee for male members over the age of 18 for upkeep on pertinent buildings in Stockholm . Belonging to the nobility in present-day Sweden may still carry some informal social privileges , and be of certain social and historical significance particularly among some groups . Sweden has , however , long been a modern democratic society and meritocratic practices are supposed to govern all appointments to state offices by law . No special privileges , in taxation or otherwise , are therefore given to any Swedish citizen based on family origins , the one exception being the Royal family and the position as head of state held by the monarch of Sweden . However , also this role is today , according to the instrument of government , ceremonial . In 1902 Sven Hedin became the last person to be ennobled in Sweden .
