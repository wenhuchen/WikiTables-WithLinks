  "/wiki/Diesel_engine": "The diesel engine ( also known as a compression-ignition or CI engine ) , named after Rudolf Diesel , is an internal combustion engine in which ignition of the fuel is caused by the elevated temperature of the air in the cylinder due to the mechanical compression ( adiabatic compression ) . This contrasts with spark-ignition engines such as a petrol engine ( gasoline engine ) or gas engine ( using a gaseous fuel as opposed to petrol ) , which use a spark plug to ignite an air-fuel mixture . Diesel engines work by compressing only the air . This increases the air temperature inside the cylinder to such a high degree that atomised diesel fuel injected into the combustion chamber ignites spontaneously . With the fuel being injected into the air just before combustion , the dispersion of the fuel is uneven ; this is called a heterogeneous air-fuel mixture . The torque a diesel engine produces is controlled by manipulating the air-fuel ratio ( \u03bb ) ; instead of throttling the intake air , the diesel engine relies on altering the amount of fuel that is injected , and the air-fuel ratio is usually high . The diesel engine has the highest thermal efficiency ( engine efficiency ) of any practical internal or external combustion engine due to its very high expansion ratio and inherent lean burn which enables heat dissipation by the excess air . A small efficiency loss is also avoided compared with two-stroke non-direct-injection gasoline engines since unburned fuel is not present at valve overlap and therefore no fuel goes directly from the intake/injection to the exhaust . Low-speed diesel engines ( as used in ships and other applications where overall engine weight is relatively unimportant ) can reach effective efficiencies of up to 55% . Diesel engines may be designed as either two-stroke or four-stroke cycles . They were originally used as a more efficient replacement for stationary steam engines . Since the 1910s they have been used in submarines and ships .",
  "/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company": "Ford Motor Company , commonly known as Ford , is an American multinational automaker that has its main headquarters in Dearborn , Michigan , a suburb of Detroit . It was founded by Henry Ford and incorporated on June 16 , 1903 . The company sells automobiles and commercial vehicles under the Ford brand , and most luxury cars under the Lincoln brand . Ford also owns Brazilian SUV manufacturer Troller , an 8% stake in Aston Martin of the United Kingdom and a 32% stake in Jiangling Motors . It also has joint-ventures in China ( Changan Ford ) , Taiwan ( Ford Lio Ho ) , Thailand ( AutoAlliance Thailand ) , Turkey ( Ford Otosan ) , and Russia ( Ford Sollers ) . The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is controlled by the Ford family ; they have minority ownership but the majority of the voting power . Ford introduced methods for large-scale manufacturing of cars and large-scale management of an industrial workforce using elaborately engineered manufacturing sequences typified by moving assembly lines ; by 1914 , these methods were known around the world as Fordism . Ford 's former UK subsidiaries Jaguar and Land Rover , acquired in 1989 and 2000 respectively , were sold to the Indian automaker Tata Motors in March 2008 . Ford owned the Swedish automaker Volvo from 1999 to 2010 . In 2011 , Ford discontinued the Mercury brand , under which it had marketed entry-level luxury cars in the United States , Canada , Mexico , and the Middle East since 1938 . Ford is the second-largest U.S.-based automaker ( behind General Motors ) and the fifth-largest in the world ( behind Toyota , VW , Hyundai-Kia and General Motors ) based on 2015 vehicle production . At the end of 2010 , Ford was the fifth largest automaker in Europe .",

There is a special Handi-Van transportation service for those who have a disability that prevents them from riding a regular city bus .",
  "/wiki/Compressed_natural_gas": "Compressed natural gas ( CNG ) ( methane stored at high pressure ) is a fuel that can be used in place of gasoline , diesel fuel and liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) . CNG combustion produces fewer undesirable gases than the aforementioned fuels . In comparison to other fuels , natural gas poses less of a threat in the event of a spill , because it is lighter than air and disperses quickly when released . Biomethane - refined biogas from anaerobic digestion or landfills - can be used . CNG is made by compressing natural gas , which is mainly composed of methane ( CH4 ) , to less than 1% of the volume it occupies at standard atmospheric pressure . It is stored and distributed in hard containers at a pressure of 20-25 MPa ( 2,900-3,600 psi ) , usually in cylindrical or spherical shapes . CNG is used in traditional gasoline/internal combustion engine automobiles that have been modified or in vehicles specifically manufactured for CNG use , either alone ( dedicated ) , with a segregated gasoline system to extend range ( dual fuel ) or in conjunction with another fuel such as diesel ( bi-fuel ) . Natural gas vehicles are increasingly used in Iran , especially Pakistan , the Asia-Pacific region , Indian capital of Delhi , and other large cities like Ahmedabad , Mumbai , Pune , Kolkata - as well as cities such as Lucknow , Kanpur , Varanasi , etc . Its use is also increasing in South America , Europe and North America because of rising gasoline prices . In response to high fuel prices and environmental concerns , CNG is starting to be used also in tuk-tuk , pickup trucks , transit and school buses , and trains . The cost and placement of fuel storage containers is the major barrier to wider/quicker adoption of CNG as a fuel . It is also why municipal government , public transportation vehicles were the most visible early adopters of it , as they can more quickly amortize the money invested in the new ( and usually cheaper ) fuel .",
