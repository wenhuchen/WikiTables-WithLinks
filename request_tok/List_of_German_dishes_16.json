  "/wiki/Himbeergeist": "Himbeergeist ( lit raspberry spirit ) is a fruit-based Schnaps produced mainly in Germany and the Alsace region of France .

The mixture is then steeped for several weeks to draw out the raspberry essence , distilled , diluted with purified water , and bottled at 40% ABV or stronger .",
