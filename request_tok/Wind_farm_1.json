  "/wiki/Nameplate_capacity": "Nameplate capacity , also known as the rated capacity , nominal capacity , installed capacity , or maximum effect , is the intended full-load sustained output of a facility such as a power plant , electric generator , a chemical plant , fuel plant , metal refinery , mine , and many others . Nameplate capacity is the number registered with authorities for classifying the power output of a power station usually expressed in megawatts ( MW ) . Power plants with an output consistently near their nameplate capacity have a high capacity factor .",
  "/wiki/Megawatt": "The watt ( symbol : W ) is a unit of power . In the International System of Units ( SI ) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second , and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer . In SI base units , the watt is described as k g m 2 s \u2212 3 { \\displaystyle kg\\ , m^ { 2 } s^ { -3 } } , which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis . The watt is named after James Watt , an 18th century scottish inventor .",
  "/wiki/Wind_turbine": "A wind turbine , or alternatively referred to as a wind energy converter , is a device that converts the wind 's kinetic energy into electrical energy . Wind turbines are manufactured in a wide range of vertical and horizontal axis . The smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging for auxiliary power for boats or caravans or to power traffic warning signs . Larger turbines can be used for making contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the electrical grid . Arrays of large turbines , known as wind farms , are becoming an increasingly important source of intermittent renewable energy and are used by many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels . One assessment claimed that , as of 2009 [ update ] , wind had the lowest relative greenhouse gas emissions , the least water consumption demands and . the most favourable social impacts compared to photovoltaic , hydro , geothermal , coal and gas .",
