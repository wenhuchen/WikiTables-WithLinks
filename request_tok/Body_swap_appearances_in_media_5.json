The games are of various genres , mostly role-playing , platform and fighting games , although the latter have become the most prominent . Since 1986 , many video games based on the property have been released in Japan , with the majority being produced by Bandai . Most of the Dragon Ball Z games from the 16-bit and 32-bit eras were also localized and released in European countries like France , Spain and Portugal because of the strong following the series already had in those countries . Up until 1997 's Dragon Ball GT : Final Bout , none of the Dragon Ball games were localized for the North American market , with the exception of Dragon Power which was graphically altered due to the lack of a license for the franchise .

The tone of the series becomes more action oriented and less comedic when Goku reaches adulthood , as he and his allies would find themselves defending Earth against various threats , overcoming seemingly insurmountable opponents and eventually emerging victorious against progressively more powerful foes .

Activision is one of the largest third-party video game publishers in the world and was the top United States publisher in 2016 . The company was founded as Activision , Inc. in October 1979 in Sunnyvale , California , by former Atari game developers , upset at how they were treated at Atari , to develop their own games for the popular Atari 2600 home video game console . Activision was the first independent , third-party , console video game developer . The 1983 video game crash , in part created by too many new companies trying to follow in Activision 's footsteps without the expertise of Activision 's founders , hurt Activision 's position in console games , forcing them to diversify into games for home computers , including the acquisition of Infocom . After a management shift , with CEO Jim Levy replaced by Bruce Davis , the company renamed itself as Mediagenic and branched out into business software applications . Mediagenic quickly fell into debt , and the company was bought for around US $ 500,000 by Bobby Kotick and a small group of investors around 1991 . Kotick instituted a full rework of the company to cover its debts : dismissing most of its staff , moving the company to Los Angeles , and reverting to the Activision name . Building on existing assets , the Kotick-led Activision pursued more publishing opportunities and , after recovering from the former debt , started acquiring numerous studios and intellectual properties over the 1990s and 2000s , among these being the Call of Duty and Guitar Hero series .

  "/wiki/Roguelike": "Roguelike ( or rogue-like ; sometimes capitalized ) is a subgenre of role-playing video game characterized by a dungeon crawl through procedurally generated levels , turn-based gameplay , tile-based graphics , and permanent death of the player character . Most roguelikes are based on a high fantasy narrative , reflecting their influence from tabletop role playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons . Though the roguelikes Beneath Apple Manor and Sword of Fargoal predate it , the 1980 game Rogue , which is an ASCII based game that runs in terminal or terminal emulator , is considered the forerunner and the namesake of the genre , with derivative games mirroring Rogue 's character- or sprite-based graphics . These games were popularized among college students and computer programmers of the 1980s and 1990s , leading to a large number of variants but adhering to these common gameplay elements , often titled the Berlin Interpretation . Some of the better-known variants include Hack , NetHack , Ancient Domains of Mystery , Moria , Angband , Tales of Maj'Eyal , and Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup . The Japanese series of Mystery Dungeon games by Chunsoft , inspired by Rogue , also fall within the concept of roguelike games . More recently , with more powerful home computers and gaming systems , several new games include elements of the roguelike genre while incorporating other gameplay genres , thematic elements , and graphical styles as well . Such games typically retain a roguelike 's notion of procedural generation and permanent death of the player character , but do not include all the high-value factors of the Berlin Interpretation . These games are frequently labeled as roguelike , but also are referred to as rogue-lite , roguelike-like , or procedural death labyrinths to distinguish them from the more traditional roguelikes .",
