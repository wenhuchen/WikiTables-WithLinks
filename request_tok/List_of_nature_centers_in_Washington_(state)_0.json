Fifty-seven people were killed ; 250 homes , 47 bridges , 15 miles ( 24 km ) of railways , and 185 miles ( 298 km ) of highway were destroyed . A massive debris avalanche , triggered by an earthquake of magnitude 5.1 , caused a lateral eruption that reduced the elevation of the mountain 's summit from 9,677 ft ( 2,950 m ) to 8,363 ft ( 2,549 m ) , leaving a 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) wide horseshoe-shaped crater . The debris avalanche was up to 0.7 cubic miles ( 2.9 km3 ) in volume . The Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument was created to preserve the volcano and allow for the eruption 's aftermath to be scientifically studied .

North Cascades National Park features the rugged mountain peaks of the North Cascades Range , the most expansive glacial system in the contiguous United States , the headwaters of numerous waterways , and vast forests with the highest degree of flora biodiversity of any American national park . The region was first settled by Paleo-Indian Native Americans ; by the time European American explorers arrived , it was inhabited by Skagit tribes . By the early 19th century , the region was visited by fur trappers and several British and American companies vied for control over the fur trade .
