Covering approximately 9,600,000 square kilometers ( 3,700,000 sq mi ) , it is the third largest country by area . [ j ] Governed by the Communist Party of China , the state exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces , [ k ] five autonomous regions , four direct-controlled municipalities ( Beijing , Tianjin , Shanghai , and Chongqing ) , and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty . China , as a whole , was ravaged by feudal warlordism and Japan during World War II .",

In Europe the epoch was called the Keuper , after a German lithostratigraphic group ( a sequence of rock strata ) that has a roughly corresponding age . The Late Triassic spans the time between 237 Ma and 201.3 Ma ( million years ago ) . It is preceeded by the Middle Triassic epoch and is followed by the Early Jurassic epoch . The Late Triassic is divided into the Carnian , Norian and Rhaetian ages . Many of the first dinosaurs evolved during the Late Triassic , including Plateosaurus , Coelophysis , and Eoraptor . The extinction event that began during the Late Triassic resulted in the disappearance of about 76% of all terrestrial and marine life species , as well as almost 20% of taxonomic families . Although the Late Triassic Epoch did not prove to be as destructive as the preceding Permian Period , which took place approximately 50 million years earlier and destroyed about 70% of land species , 57% of insect families as well as 95% of marine life , it resulted in great decreased in population sizes of many living organism populations .

These groups once served as vital index fossils , which made it possible to identify feasible life span to multiple strata of the Triassic strata .",

The formation is subdivided into four members , from old to young ; La Pe\u00f1a , Cancha de Bochas , Valle de la Luna and Quebrada de la Sal . The sandstones , mudstones , conglomerates and tuffs of the formation were deposited in a humid alluvial to fluvial floodplain environment , characterized by strongly seasonal rainfall . The Ischigualasto Formation is an important paleontological unit and considered a Lagerst\u00e4tte , as it preserves several genera of early dinosaurs , other archosaurs , synapsids , and temnospondyls of the Late Triassic . Coprolites and fossil wood also have been found in the formation . The formation crops out in the in 1967 established Ischigualasto Provincial Park , which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000 ."
