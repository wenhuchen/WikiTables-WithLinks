( An additional short turn route , SLW , runs only at peak hours between South Station and Silver Line Way . ) The SL1 and SL3 operate in mixed traffic through the Ted Williams Tunnel ; the SL3 uses a limited-access haul road in East Boston and a dedicated busway in Chelsea for part of its route . The SL2 operates in mixed traffic in the Seaport . The Waterfront routes use articulated dual-mode buses that operate as electric trolleybuses in the Transitway and conventional diesel buses on the surface .

With an end-to-end travel time of less than twenty minutes , the Blue Line is the shortest of Boston 's heavy-rail lines and the only line to have both third rail and overhead catenary sections . The East Boston Tunnel was built as a streetcar tunnel in 1904 with Howard A. Carson as chief engineer ; after an extension to Bowdoin in 1916 , it was converted to heavy rail metro rolling stock in 1924 . In 1952 and 1954 the line was extended along the former route of the Boston , Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad , in a project intended to reach Lynn but ultimately cut short to Wonderland . Further extensions to Lynn and Charles/MGH downtown are long-planned but not yet funded . From approximately 1998-2011 , the MBTA made most Blue Line stations fully accessible as part of a larger effort to accommodate 6-car trains on the line .

  "/wiki/Framingham/Worcester_Line": "The Framingham/Worcester Line of the MBTA Commuter Rail system runs west from Boston , Massachusetts to Worcester , Massachusetts through the MetroWest region , serving 17 station stops in Boston , Newton , Wellesley , Natick , Framingham , Ashland , Southborough , Westborough , Grafton , and Worcester . The third-longest and second-busiest line on the system , the Framingham/Worcester Line is plagued by poor track conditions , interference from freight trains , and a number of non-handicapped-accessible stations . Service on the line is a mix of local and express trains serving Worcester plus short-turn Framingham locals . The Framingham/Worcester Line was one of the first commuter rail lines , with daily commuter-oriented service to West Newton beginning in 1834 . Originally the Boston and Worcester Railroad , service has been operated by the Boston and Albany Railroad , New York Central , Penn Central , and since 1964 by Boston and Maine Railroad , Amtrak , and the MBCR until 2014 under contract to the MBTA . Since 2014 service has been operated by Keolis North America . In 1975 the line was cut back to Framingham , but service returned to Worcester in 1994 with four infill stations added between 2000 and 2002 . After purchasing the Framingham-Worcester trackage from CSX in 2012 , the MBTA has begun adding service to the outer section of the line and performing track work to increase speeds and reliability . A new station at Boston Landing opened in 2017 . The line is the second-busiest on the MBTA Commuter Rail system , with 18,636 daily riders by a 2018 count . All stations from Boston Landing east and West Natick west are handicapped accessible ; those in between are not . [ citation needed ]",
