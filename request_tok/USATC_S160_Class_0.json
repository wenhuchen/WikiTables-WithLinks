The state 's largest city is Baltimore , and its capital is Annapolis . Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State , the Free State , and the Chesapeake Bay State . It is named after the English queen Henrietta Maria , known in England as Queen Mary , who was the wife of King Charles I. Sixteen of Maryland 's twenty-three counties , as well as the city of Baltimore , border the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay estuary and its many tributaries , which combined total more than 4,000 miles of shoreline .

In a similar vein , Maryland 's geography , culture , and history combine elements of the Mid-Atlantic , Northeastern , and South Atlantic regions of the country . Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century , Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans , mostly by the Algonquin , and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux . As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain , Maryland was founded by George Calvert , a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England . In 1632 , Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter , naming the colony after his wife , Queen Mary ( Henrietta Maria of France ) . Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans , who rejected Catholicism in their settlements , Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration . Accordingly , in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion , which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation . Nevertheless , religious strife was common in the early years , and Catholics remained a minority , albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony .",

Landings here were necessary to link the British landings to the east at Gold with the American landing to the west at Utah , thus providing a continuous lodgement on the Normandy coast of the Bay of the Seine . Taking Omaha was to be the responsibility of United States Army troops , with sea transport , mine sweeping , and a naval bombardment force provided predominantly by the United States Navy and Coast Guard , with contributions from the British , Canadian , and Free French navies . The primary objective at Omaha was to secure a beachhead of eight kilometers ( 5.0 miles ) depth , between Port-en-Bessin and the Vire River , linking with the British landings at Gold to the east , and reaching the area of Isigny to the west to link up with VII Corps landing at Utah .

Remnants of strong coal , wool and iron ore industries remain in the county , having attracted people over the centuries , and this can be seen in the buildings and architecture . Major railways and two major motorways traverse the county , which also contains Leeds Bradford International Airport . West Yorkshire County Council was abolished in 1986 , so its five districts became effectively unitary authorities . However , the metropolitan county , which covers an area of 2,029 square kilometres ( 783 sq mi ) , continues to exist in law , and as a geographic frame of reference . Since 1 April 2014 West Yorkshire has been a combined authority area , with the local authorities pooling together some functions over transport and regeneration as the West Yorkshire Combined Authority . West Yorkshire includes the West Yorkshire Urban Area , which is the biggest and most built-up urban area within the historic county boundaries of Yorkshire .",

  "/wiki/West_Midlands_(county)": "The West Midlands County is a metropolitan county and combined authority area in western-central England with a 2018 estimated population of 2,916,458 , making it the second most populous county in England after Greater London . It came into existence as a metropolitan county in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972 , formed from parts of Staffordshire , Worcestershire and Warwickshire . The county itself is a NUTS 2 region within the wider NUTS 1 region of the same name . The county consists of seven metropolitan boroughs : the City of Birmingham , the City of Coventry and the City of Wolverhampton , as well as the boroughs of Dudley , Sandwell , Solihull and Walsall . The metropolitan county exists in law and as a geographic frame of reference , and as a ceremonial county it has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff . Between 1974 and 1986 , the West Midlands County Council was the administrative body covering the county ; this was abolished on 31 March 1986 , and the constituent metropolitan boroughs effectively became unitary authorities . A new administrative body for the county ( and some of the district surrounding it as Non-Constituent members ) , the West Midlands Combined Authority , was created in June 2016 . Since May 2017 , the authority has been headed by a directly elected Mayor of the West Midlands , a position currently held by Andy Street of the Conservative Party . Other county-wide bodies include the West Midlands Police , the West Midlands Fire Service and Transport for West Midlands . The county is sometimes described as the West Midlands metropolitan area or the West Midlands conurbation or Greater Birmingham , although these have different , and less clearly defined , boundaries . The main conurbation , or urban area , does not include Coventry for example . The name West Midlands is also used for the much larger West Midlands region , which sometimes causes confusion , not surprising perhaps when geographically it is on the eastern side of the region , the western side comprising Shropshire and Herefordshire the southern side comprising Worcestershire and most of Warwickshire .",
