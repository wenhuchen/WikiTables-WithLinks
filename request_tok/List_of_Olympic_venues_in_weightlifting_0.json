Organised by the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) , which had been created by Pierre de Coubertin , it was held in Athens , Greece , from 6 to 15 April 1896 . Fourteen nations and 241 , all male , athletes took part in the games . Participants were all European , or living in Europe , with the exception of the United States team . Winners were given a silver medal , while runners-up received a copper medal . Retroactively , the IOC has converted these to gold and silver , and awarded bronze medals to third placed athletes . Ten of the 14 participating nations earned medals . The United States won the most gold medals , 11 , host nation Greece won the most medals overall , 46 . The highlight for the Greeks was the marathon victory by their compatriot Spyridon Louis . The most successful competitor was German wrestler and gymnast Carl Schuhmann , who won four events . Over 65% of the competing athletes were Greek . Athens had been unanimously chosen to stage the inaugural modern Games during a congress organised by Coubertin in Paris on 23 June 1894 , during which the IOC was also created , because Greece was the birthplace of the Ancient Olympic Games .",

One of the main historic attractions of Athens , it is the only stadium in the world built entirely of marble . A stadium was built on the site of a simple racecourse by the Athenian statesman Lykourgos ( Lycurgus ) c. 330 BC , primarily for the Panathenaic Games . It was rebuilt in marble by Herodes Atticus , an Athenian Roman senator , by 144 AD and had a capacity of 50,000 seats . After the rise of Christianity in the 4th century it was largely abandoned . The stadium was excavated in 1869 and hosted the Zappas Olympics in 1870 and 1875 . After being refurbished , it hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the first modern Olympics in 1896 and was the venue for 4 of the 9 contested sports . It was used for various purposes in the 20th century and was once again used as an Olympic venue in 2004 . It is the finishing point for the annual Athens Classic Marathon . It is also the last venue in Greece from where the Olympic flame handover ceremony to the host nation takes place .",

This made athletics the most international of the nine sports at the 1896 Games . The American team of 11 , which featured only one national champion , was dominant , taking 9 of the 12 titles . No world records were set , because few international top competitors had participated . In addition , the curves of the track were very tight , making fast times in the running events virtually impossible . The heats of the 100 metres were the first Olympic event to be conducted , and the winner of the first heat , Francis Lane , can thus be considered the first Olympic winner .

It was the first time that the Olympic Games were held outside Europe . Boxing , the oldest combat sport , was introduced . Tensions caused by the Russo-Japanese War and the difficulty of getting to St. Louis in 1904 may have contributed to the fact that very few top ranked athletes from outside the US and Canada took part in these Games . Only 62 of the 651 athletes who competed came from outside North America , and only 12-15 nations were represented in all . Some events combined the U.S. national championship with the Olympic championship .

A second American team , the Brooklyn Crescents , was originally slated to round out the field but did not participate . In June , they were ruled to have used professional players that spring ; however , they were still scheduled to play a semi-final against the Shamrocks , but did not show for the match . Recent scholarship has indicated that the lacrosse tournament at the 1904 Games is nowhere near as orderly as presented above -- among other things , the game between Triple A and Mohawk Indians was actually a four-game series , tied at two games apiece , and the Mohawks may not have been an Olympic team at all , but a participant in an indigenous games competition with other tribes .",

No fixed host city was proposed at the time . The 1916 Summer Olympics , to be held in Berlin , capital of the German Empire , were cancelled due to World War I . The aftermath of the war and the Paris Peace Conference , 1919 affected the Olympic Games not only due to new states being created , but also by sanctions against the nations that lost the war and were blamed for starting it . Hungary , Germany , Austria , Bulgaria , and the Ottoman Empire were banned from competing in the Games .

The games were the first to be televised , and radio broadcasts reached 41 countries . Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl was commissioned by the German Olympic Committee to film the Games for $ 7 million . Her film , titled Olympia , pioneered many of the techniques now common in the filming of sports . Hitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy and antisemitism , and the official Nazi party paper , the V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter , wrote in the strongest terms that Jews should not be allowed to participate in the Games .

No new venues were built for the games ( with events taking place mainly at Empire Stadium and the Empire Pool at Wembley Park ) , and athletes were housed in existing accommodation at the Wembley area instead of an Olympic Village , as were the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games and the subsequent 1952 Games in Helsinki .

  "/wiki/Earls_Court_Exhibition_Centre": "Earls Court Exhibition Centre was a major international exhibition and events venue just west of central London . At its peak it is said to have generated a \u00a32 billion turnover for the economy . It replaced exhibition and entertainment grounds , originally opened in 1887 , with an art moderne structure built between 1935 and 1937 by specialist American architect C. Howard Crane . With the active support of London Mayor Boris Johnson , in an attempt to create Europe 's largest regeneration scheme , its proposed heritage listing was refused after it was acquired by developers , who promptly in 2008 applied for and were granted a Certificate of Immunity from Listing by English Heritage , and its demolition was duly completed in 2017 . The area has since returned to its former state of waste ground only with an adjacent devastated Green corridor . Located in Earl 's Court but straddling the boundary between the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham , it was the largest such venue within the capital served by two London Underground stations - one of them , Earl 's Court tube station , being specially adapted with a tunnel for show visitors , and in latter years with a direct link to Heathrow Airport . The founder of the entertainment grounds was Leeds entrepreneur John R. Whitley and the first attraction headlined performances by Buffalo Bill Cody as part of the American Show visited by Queen Victoria and subsequently by members of the Royal Household . This was followed by numerous other exhibitions representing countries such as Canada , France and India . Earls Court was widely known for serving as London 's and the country 's premier exhibition venue for many decades , hosting the Royal Smithfield Show , Royal Tournament , the British International Motor Show , London Boat Show , the Ideal Home Show , Billy Graham rallies , the Brit Awards ( until 2010 ) , Crufts and other events such as large scale opera productions and pop concerts in addition to hundreds of trade shows , such as the London Book Fair . It was also used as one of the venues for both the 1948 and 2012 Olympic Games .",

Opened in 1976 , the GWCC was the first state-owned convention center established in the United States . The center is operated on behalf of the state by the Georgia World Congress Center Authority , which was chartered in 1971 by Georgia General Assembly to develop an international trade and exhibition center in Atlanta . The authority later developed the Georgia Dome , Centennial Olympic Park , and Mercedes-Benz Stadium , which replaced the Georgia Dome . In 2017 , the Georgia Dome was closed on March 5 and demolished by implosion on November 20 while Mercedes-Benz Stadium officially opened on August 26 . While the GWCCA owns Mercedes-Benz Stadium , AMB Group , the parent organization for the National Football League 's Atlanta Falcons and Major League Soccer 's Atlanta United FC , is responsible for the stadium 's operations . In addition to convention and trade shows , the GWCC often coordinated with the Georgia Dome to host activities in conjunction with major events being held at the dome . Every year , the center hosts SEC Football Fanfare , a two-day fan festival for the thousands of Southeastern Conference football fans in the city for the SEC Championship Game . The center played host to a similar event in tandem with WrestleMania XXVII , WrestleMania Axxess . Family Feud started taping at Georgia World Congress Center in 2015 and stayed there until 2018 , when it moved back to Los Angeles . The GWCC is located in downtown Atlanta at 285 Andrew Young International Boulevard NW , adjacent to CNN Center and State Farm Arena .",
