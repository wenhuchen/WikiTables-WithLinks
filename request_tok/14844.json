This freestyle wrestling competition consisted of a single-elimination tournament , with a repechage used to determine the winners of two bronze medals . The two finalists faced off for gold and silver medals . Each wrestler who lost to one of the two finalists moved into the repechage , culminating in a pair of bronze medal matches featuring the semifinal losers each facing the remaining repechage opponent from their half of the bracket . Each bout consisted of up to three rounds , lasting two minutes apiece . The wrestler who scored more points in each round was the winner of that rounds ; the bout finished when one wrestler had won two rounds ( and thus the match ) . On 29 August 2016 , a report indicated that a retested sample for silver medalist Besik Kudukhov taken at the time of this event had returned a positive result ( later disclosed as dehydrochlormethyltestosterone ) . On 27 October 2016 , the IOC stated that they were unaware that Kudukhov had died in a car accident in December 2013 at the time the decision to include his samples in the re-analysis process was made . Since such proceedings can not be conducted against a deceased person , the IOC dropped all disciplinary proceedings against him . As a result , Olympic results that would most likely have been reviewed will remain uncorrected .",
