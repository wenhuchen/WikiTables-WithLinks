  "/wiki/NBA_Finals": "The NBA Finals is the annual championship series of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . The Eastern and Western conference champions play a best-of-seven game series to determine the league champion . The winners of the Finals are awarded the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy , which replaced the Walter A . Brown Trophy in 1983 . The series was initially known as the BAA Finals prior to the 1949-50 season when the Basketball Association of America ( BAA ) merged with the National Basketball League ( NBL ) to form the NBA . The competition oversaw further name changes to NBA World Championship Series from 1950 to 1985 , as well as a brief stint as the Showdown , before settling on NBA Finals in 1986 . Since 2018 , it has been officially known as the NBA Finals presented by YouTube TV for sponsorship reasons . The NBA Finals was initially structured in a 2-2-1-1-1 format . In 1985 , to ease the amount of cross-country travel , it was changed to a 2-3-2 format , where the first two and last two games of the series were played at the arena of the team who earned home-court advantage by having the better record during the regular season . In 2014 , the 2-2-1-1-1 format was restored . The first two games are played the higher-seeded team 's home , the following two at the home of the lower-seeded team , and the remaining three are played at each team 's home arena alternately . A total of 19 franchises have won the NBA Finals , with the Toronto Raptors winning in 2019 .",

As general manager and team president of the Celtics , he won an additional seven NBA titles , for a grand total of 16 in a span of 29 years , making him one of the most successful team officials in the history of North American professional sports . Auerbach is remembered as a pioneer of modern basketball , redefining basketball as a game dominated by team play and defense and for introducing the fast break as a potent offensive weapon . He groomed many players who went on to be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame . Additionally , Auerbach was vital in breaking down color barriers in the NBA . He made history by drafting the first African-American NBA player , Chuck Cooper in 1950 , introduced the first African-American starting five in 1964 , and hired the first African-American head coach in North American sports ( Bill Russell in 1966 ) . Famous for his polarizing nature , he was well known for smoking a cigar when he thought a victory was assured , a habit that became , for many , the ultimate symbol of victory during his Boston tenure . In 1967 , the NBA Coach of the Year award , which he had won in 1965 , was named the Red Auerbach Trophy , and Auerbach was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1969 . In 1980 , he was named the greatest coach in the history of the NBA by the Professional Basketball Writers Association of America , and was NBA Executive of the Year in 1980 .

The Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Eastern Conference and defending NBA champion Boston Celtics 4 games to 2 . The key moment of the series was Magic Johnson 's junior sky hook in Game 4 . This was the tenth time that the Celtics and Lakers met in the NBA Finals ( more than any other Finals matchup ) . It would be the Celtics ' last Finals appearance until the two teams met in 2008 . This was the first NBA Championship Series conducted entirely in June . The last time there were no NBA Championship Series games in May was in the 1970-1971 season , when the finals ( a four-game sweep that year ) ended on April 30 . It is also the first NBA Finals series to be conducted on a Sunday-Tuesday-Thursday rotation , which was in use until 1990 and revived since the 2004 NBA Finals ; in between the NBA Finals were conducted on a Sunday-Wednesday-Friday rotation .",

The Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons 4 games to 3 . One of Los Angeles Lakers head coach Pat Riley 's most famous moments came when he promised the crowd a repeat championship during the Lakers ' 1986-87 championship parade in downtown Los Angeles . With every team in the league now gunning for them , the Los Angeles Lakers still found a way to win , taking their seventh consecutive Pacific Division title . While the 1988 Lakers did not produce as many wins in the regular season as the 1987 Lakers , they were just as successful in the playoffs , becoming the first team in 19 years to repeat as champions . The Lakers met the physical Detroit Pistons in the 1988 NBA Finals . One of Pistons guard Isiah Thomas 's career-defining performances came in Game 6 . Despite badly twisting his ankle midway through the period , Thomas scored an NBA Finals record 25 third-quarter points , as Detroit fell valiantly , 103-102 , to the Lakers at the Forum . Thomas still managed to score 10 first-half points in Game 7 , as Detroit built a 5-point lead . In the 3rd quarter , the Lakers , inspired by Finals MVP James Worthy and Byron Scott ( 14 3rd-quarter points ) , exploded as they built a 10-point lead entering the final period . The lead swelled to 15 before Detroit mounted a furious 4th-quarter rally , trimming the lead to two points on several occasions .",

Dwyane Wade of the Heat was named Most Valuable Player of the series . This series marked the first time since 1971 that the Finals featured two teams playing in their first NBA Finals series . It was the first occasion since 1978 that two teams who had never won an NBA Championship contested the NBA Finals . The two teams met again five years later in 2011 , the second Finals appearance for both franchises , with the Mavericks winning the rematch over the Heat . This was the second NBA Finals matchup of teams from Florida and Texas , after the Houston Rockets and Orlando Magic contested the 1995 NBA Finals . Until the Miami Heat defeated the San Antonio Spurs in the 2013 NBA Finals , it was the last Finals loss by a team from Texas ( the Rockets lost in 1981 and 1986 ) against eight championships ( five by the Spurs , two by the Rockets , and one by the Mavericks , who won a rematch of this Finals in 2011 ) .",

  "/wiki/Seattle_SuperSonics": "The Seattle SuperSonics , commonly known as the Sonics , were an American professional basketball team based in Seattle , Washington . The SuperSonics played in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) as a member club of the league 's Western Conference Pacific and Northwest divisions from 1967 until 2008 . After the 2007-08 season ended , the team relocated to Oklahoma City , Oklahoma , and now plays as the Oklahoma City Thunder . Sam Schulman owned the team from its 1967 inception until 1983 . It was then owned by Barry Ackerley ( 1983-2001 ) , and then Basketball Club of Seattle , headed by Starbucks chairman emeritus , former president and CEO Howard Schultz ( 2001-2006 ) . On July 18 , 2006 , the Basketball Club of Seattle sold the SuperSonics and its Women 's National Basketball Association ( WNBA ) sister franchise Seattle Storm to the Professional Basketball Club LLC , headed by Oklahoma City businessman Clay Bennett . The sale was approved by the NBA Board of Governors on October 24 , 2006 , and finalized on October 31 , 2006 , at which point the new ownership group took control . After failing to find public funding to construct a new arena in the Seattle area , the SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City before the 2008-09 season , following a $ 45 million settlement with the city of Seattle to pay off the team 's existing lease at KeyArena at Seattle Center in advance of its 2010 expiration . Home games were played at KeyArena , originally known as Seattle Center Coliseum , for 33 of the franchise 's 41 seasons in Seattle . In 1978 , the team moved to the Kingdome , which was shared with the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) and the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League ( NFL ) . They returned to the Coliseum full-time in 1985 , moving temporarily to the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma , Washington , for the 1994-95 season while the Coliseum was renovated and rebranded as KeyArena .

  "/wiki/Toronto_Raptors": "The Toronto Raptors are a Canadian professional basketball team based in Toronto . The Raptors compete in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) as a member of the league 's Eastern Conference Atlantic Division . They play their home games at the Scotiabank Arena , which they share with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . The team was founded in 1995 as part of the NBA 's expansion into Canada , along with the Vancouver Grizzlies . Since the 2001-02 season , the Raptors have been the only Canadian-based team in the league , as the Grizzlies relocated from Vancouver to Memphis , Tennessee . As with most expansion teams , the Raptors struggled in their early years ; but after the acquisition of Vince Carter through a draft-day trade in 1998 , the franchise set league-attendance records and made the NBA playoffs in 2000 , 2001 , and 2002 . Carter was instrumental in leading the team to their first playoff series win in 2001 , where they advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals . During the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons , they failed to make significant progress , and Carter was traded in 2004 to the New Jersey Nets . After Carter left , Chris Bosh emerged as the team leader . For the 2006-07 season , Bryan Colangelo was appointed as general manager , and through a combination of Bosh , 2006 first overall draft pick Andrea Bargnani , and a revamp of the roster , the Raptors qualified for their first playoff berth in five years , capturing the Atlantic Division title . In the 2007-08 season , they also advanced to the playoffs but failed to reach the post-season in each of the next five seasons . Colangelo overhauled the team 's roster for the 2009-10 season in a bid to persuade pending free agent Bosh to stay , but Bosh departed to sign with the Miami Heat in July 2010 , ushering in yet another era of rebuilding for the Raptors .",

  "/wiki/1979_NBA_Finals": "The 1979 NBA World Championship Series was the championship series played at the conclusion of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) 's 1978-79 season . The Western Conference champion Seattle SuperSonics played the Eastern Conference champion Washington Bullets , with the Bullets holding home-court advantage , due to a better regular season record . The SuperSonics defeated the Bullets 4 games to 1 . The series was a rematch of the 1978 NBA Finals , which the Washington Bullets had won 4-3 . Dennis Johnson of the SuperSonics was named as the NBA Finals MVP , while Gus Williams of the SuperSonics was the top scorer , averaging 28.6 points per game . This was Seattle 's second men 's professional sports championship , following the Seattle Metropolitans ' Stanley Cup victory in the 1917 Stanley Cup Finals . Coincidentally , this series ( along with the 1978 NBA Finals ) was informally known as the George Washington series , because both teams were playing in places named after the first President of the United States ( the SuperSonics represented Seattle , the most populous city in the state of Washington , and the Bullets represented Washington , D.C. , albeit playing in nearby Landover , Maryland ) . This is the most recent time that a Western Conference team based outside of Texas or California has won an NBA title , and the last of only two occasions alongside the 1976-77 Portland Trail Blazers when a team from the present-day Northwest Division has won the league title , which is by 26 years the longest league championship drought for any division of the four major North American sports leagues . [ note 1 ] Since then , the following Western teams have gone on to win an NBA title : the Los Angeles Lakers ( ten times ) , the San Antonio Spurs ( five times ) , the Golden State Warriors ( three times ) , the Houston Rockets ( twice ) , and the Dallas Mavericks ( once ) . The remaining eighteen titles since 1980 have been won by Eastern Conference teams . [ note 2 ]"
