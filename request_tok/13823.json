Despite this , it has been one of his most enduringly popular works . It was one of the songs Mort Shuman translated into English for the musical Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris . Brel worked on the song at his house overlooking the Mediterranean at Roquebrune-Cap-Martin , the house he shared with Sylvie Rivet , a publicist for Philips ; a place she had introduced him to in 1960 . It was the ideal place for him to create , and to indulge his passion for boats and planes . One morning at six o'clock he read the words of Amsterdam to Fernand , a restaurateur who was about to set off fishing for scorpion fish and conger eels for the bouillabaisse . Overcome , Fernand broke out in sobs and cut open some sea urchins to help control his emotion . Originally the song was situated in Antwerp , but moved to Amsterdam as 'Dans le port D'Anvers ' does not fit the meter . Noteworthy is that in modern Amsterdam there is still a port , but owing to widespread automation and decline in crew sizes , there are far fewer sailors on shore leave .",

  "/wiki/Jeff_Buckley": "Jeffrey Scott Buckley ( November 17 , 1966 - May 29 , 1997 ) , raised as Scott Moorhead , was an American singer , songwriter and guitarist . After a decade as a session guitarist in Los Angeles , Buckley amassed a following in the early 1990s by playing cover songs at venues in Manhattan 's East Village such as Sin-\u00e9 , gradually focusing more on his own material . After rebuffing much interest from record labels and his father 's manager , Herb Cohen , he signed with Columbia , recruited a band , and recorded what would be his only studio album , Grace , in 1994 . Over the following three years , the band toured extensively to promote the album , including concerts in the U.S. , Europe , Japan , and Australia . In 1996 , they stopped touring and made sporadic attempts to record Buckley 's second album in New York City with Tom Verlaine as producer . In 1997 , Buckley moved to Memphis , Tennessee , to resume work on the album , to be titled My Sweetheart the Drunk , recording many four-track demos while also playing weekly solo shows at a local venue . On May 29 , 1997 , while awaiting the arrival of his band from New York , he drowned during a spontaneous evening swim , fully clothed , in the Mississippi River when he was caught in the wake of a passing boat ; his body was found on June 4 . Since his death , there have been many posthumous releases of his material , including a collection of four-track demos and studio recordings for his unfinished second album My Sweetheart the Drunk , expansions of Grace , and the Live at Sin-\u00e9 EP . Chart success also came posthumously : with his cover of Leonard Cohen 's song Hallelujah he attained his first number one on Billboard 's Hot Digital Songs in March 2008 and reached number 2 in the UK Singles Chart that December . Buckley and his work remain popular and are regularly featured in greatest lists in the music press ; in 2004 , Rolling Stone listed him at number 39 on their list of greatest singers of all time .",

  "/wiki/Bohemian_Rhapsody": "Bohemian Rhapsody is a song by the British rock band Queen . It was written by Freddie Mercury for the band 's 1975 album A Night at the Opera . It is a six-minute suite , consisting of several sections without a chorus : an intro , a ballad segment , an operatic passage , a hard rock part and a reflective coda . The song is a more accessible take on the 1970s progressive rock genre . Upon its release as a single , Bohemian Rhapsody became a commercial success , topping the UK Singles Chart for nine weeks and selling more than a million copies by the end of January 1976 . It reached number one again in 1991 for another five weeks when the same version was re-released following Mercury 's death , eventually becoming the UK 's third-best-selling single of all time . It is also the only song to be the UK Christmas number one twice by the same artist . It topped the charts in several other markets as well , including Canada , Australia , New Zealand , Ireland , and The Netherlands , later becoming one of the best-selling singles of all time selling over six million copies worldwide . In the United States , the song originally peaked at number nine in 1976 , but returned to the chart in 1992 after being used in the film Wayne 's World and reached a new peak of number two on the Billboard Hot 100 . The release of the film of the same name in 2018 resulted in renewed popularity and chart success worldwide for the song . Although critical reaction was initially mixed , Bohemian Rhapsody became Queen 's most popular song and is considered one of the greatest rock songs of all time . The single was accompanied by a promotional video , which scholars consider ground-breaking .",
  "/wiki/Queen_(band)": "Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970 . Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury ( lead vocals , piano ) , Brian May ( guitar , vocals ) , Roger Taylor ( drums , vocals ) and John Deacon ( bass ) . Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock , hard rock and heavy metal , but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles , such as arena rock and pop rock . Before forming Queen , May and Taylor had played together in the band Smile . Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques . He joined in 1970 and suggested the name Queen . Deacon was recruited in March 1971 , before the band released their eponymous debut album in 1973 . Queen first charted in the UK with their second album , Queen II , in 1974 . Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 brought them international success . The latter featured Bohemian Rhapsody , which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and helped popularise the music video format . The band 's 1977 album News of the World contained We Will Rock You and We Are the Champions , which have become anthems at sporting events . By the early 1980s , Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world ."
