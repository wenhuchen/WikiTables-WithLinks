  "/wiki/Methodism": "Methodism is an umbrella term used to describe denominations of Protestant Christianity which follow the line of the Methodist movement . Methodist denominations are historically related and derive their doctrine of practice and belief from the life and teachings of John Wesley . George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people .",
  "/wiki/English_Gothic_architecture": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls .",
  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

  "/wiki/Flint": "Flint is a sedimentary cryptocrystalline form of the mineral quartz , categorized as the variety of chert that occurs in chalk or marly limestone . Flint was widely used historically to make stone tools and start fires . It occurs chiefly as nodules and masses in sedimentary rocks , such as chalks and limestones . Inside the nodule , flint is usually dark grey , black , green , white or brown in colour , and often has a glassy or waxy appearance . A thin layer on the outside of the nodules is usually different in colour , typically white and rough in texture . The nodules can often be found along streams and beaches . Flint breaks and chips into sharp-edged pieces , making it useful for knife blades and other cutting tools . The use of flint to make stone tools dates back millions of years , and flint 's extreme durability has made it possible to accurately date its use over this time . Flint is one of the primary materials used to define the Stone Age . During the Stone Age , access to flint was so important for survival that people would travel or trade to obtain flint . Flint Ridge in Ohio was an important source of flint and Native Americans extracted the flint from hundreds of quarries along the ridge . This Ohio Flint was traded across the eastern United States and has been found as far west as the Rocky Mountains and south around the Gulf of Mexico .",
  "/wiki/English_Reformation": "The English Reformation was a series of events in 16th-century England by which the Church of England broke away from the authority of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church . These events were , in part , associated with the wider European Protestant Reformation , a religious and political movement that affected the practice of Christianity across western and central Europe . Causes included the invention of the printing press and increased circulation of the Bible , and the transmission of new knowledge and ideas among scholars , the upper and middle classes and readers in general . However , the various phases of the English Reformation , which also covered Wales and Ireland , were largely driven by changes in government policy , to which public opinion gradually accommodated itself . Based on Henry VIII 's desire for an annulment of his marriage ( first requested of Pope Clement VII in 1527 ) , the English Reformation was at the outset more of a political affair than a theological dispute . The reality of political differences between Rome and England allowed growing theological disputes to come to the fore . Until the break with Rome , it was the Pope and general councils of the church that decided doctrine . Church law was governed by canon law with final jurisdiction in Rome . Church taxes were paid straight to Rome , and the Pope had the final word in the appointment of bishops . The break with Rome was effected by a series of acts of Parliament passed between 1532 and 1534 , among them the 1534 Act of Supremacy , which declared that Henry was the Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England . ( This title was renounced by Mary I in 1553 in the process of restoring papal jurisdiction ; when Elizabeth I reasserted the royal supremacy in 1559 , her title was Supreme Governor . ) Final authority in doctrinal and legal disputes now rested with the monarch , and the papacy was deprived of revenue and the final say on the appointment of bishops .",

  "/wiki/Baptists": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies .

  "/wiki/Vernacular_architecture": "Vernacular architecture is architecture characterised by the use of local materials and knowledge , usually without the supervision of professional architects . Vernacular architecture represents the majority of buildings and settlements created in pre-industrial societies and includes a very wide range of buildings , building traditions , and methods of construction . Vernacular buildings are typically simple and practical , whether residential houses or built for other purposes . Although it encompasses 95% of the world 's built environment , vernacular architecture tends to be overlooked in traditional histories of design . It is not one specific style , so it can not be distilled into a series of easy-to-digest patterns , materials , or elements . Because of the usage of traditional building methods and local builders , vernacular buildings are considered part of a regional culture . Vernacular architecture can be contrasted against elite or polite architecture which is characterized by stylistic elements of design intentionally incorporated for aesthetic purposes which go beyond a building 's functional requirements . This article also covers the term traditional architecture , which exists somewhere between the two extremes yet still is based upon authentic themes .",
  "/wiki/Tracery": "In architecture , tracery is the stonework elements that support the glass in a Gothic window . The term probably derives from the 'tracing floors ' on which the complex patterns of late Gothic windows were laid out . There are two main types , plate tracery and the later bar tracery . The evolving style from Romanesque to Gothic architecture and changing features , like the thinning of lateral walls and enlarging of windows lead to the innovation of tracery . The earliest form of tracery , called plate tracery , began as openings that were pierced from a stone slab . Bar tracery was then implemented , having derived from the plate tracery . However instead of a slab , the windows were defined by molded stone mullions which were lighter and allowed for more openings and intricate designs . Other notable styles of tracery to follow include geometrical tracery and curvilinear ( flowing ) tracery .",

  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",

  "/wiki/Wesleyanism": "Wesleyan theology , otherwise known as Wesleyan-Arminian theology , or Methodist theology , is a theological tradition in Protestant Christianity that emphasizes the methods of the eighteenth-century evangelical reformers John Wesley and his brother Charles Wesley . More broadly , it refers to the theological system inferred from the various sermons , theological treatises , letters , journals , diaries , hymns , and other spiritual writings of the Wesleys and their contemporary coadjutors such as John William Fletcher . Wesleyan-Arminian theology , manifest today in Methodism ( inclusive of the Holiness movement ) , is named for its founders , the Wesleys , as well as for Jacob Arminius , since it is a subset of Arminian theology . In 1736 , these two brothers traveled to the Georgia colony in America as missionaries for the Church of England ; they left rather disheartened at what they saw . Both of them subsequently had religious experiences , especially John in 1738 , being greatly influenced by the Moravian Christians . They began to organize a renewal movement within the Church of England to focus on personal faith and holiness . John Wesley took Protestant churches to task over the nature of sanctification , the process by which a believer is conformed to the image of Christ , emphasizing New Testament teachings regarding the work of God and the believer in sanctification . The movement did well within the Church of England in Britain , but when the movement crossed the ocean into America , it took on a form of its own , finally being established as the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1784 . The Methodist churches are similar to Anglicanism ( in Church government and liturgical practices ) , yet have added a strong emphasis on personal faith and personal experience , especially on the new birth and entire sanctification . At its heart , the theology of John Wesley stressed the life of Christian holiness : to love God with all ones heart , mind , soul and strength , and to love one 's neighbour as oneself . Wesleys teaching also stressed experiential religion and moral responsibility .",
  "/wiki/Lancet_window": "A lancet window is a tall , narrow window with a pointed arch at its top . It acquired the lancet name from its resemblance to a lance . Instances of this architectural motif are typical of Gothic church edifices of the earliest period . Lancet windows may occur singly , or paired under a single moulding , or grouped in an odd number with the tallest window at the centre . The architectural motif first appeared in the early French Gothic period ( c. 1140-1200 ) , and later in the English period of Gothic architecture ( 1200-1275 ) . So common was the lancet window feature that this era is sometimes known as the Lancet Period . The term lancet window is properly applied to windows of austere form , without tracery . Paired windows were sometimes surmounted by a simple opening such as a quatrefoil cut in plate tracery . This form gave way to the more ornate , multi-light traceried windowed .",
  "/wiki/Renaissance_Revival_architecture": "Renaissance Revival architecture ( sometimes referred to as Neo-Renaissance ) is a group of 19th century architectural revival styles which were neither Greek Revival nor Gothic Revival but which instead drew inspiration from a wide range of classicizing Italian modes . Under the broad designation Renaissance architecture nineteenth-century architects and critics went beyond the architectural style which began in Florence and central Italy in the early 15th century as an expression of Renaissance humanism ; they also included styles we would identify as Mannerist or Baroque . Self-applied style designations were rife in the mid- and later nineteenth century : Neo-Renaissance might be applied by contemporaries to structures that others called Italianate , or when many French Baroque features are present ( Second Empire ) . The divergent forms of Renaissance architecture in different parts of Europe , particularly in France and Italy , has added to the difficulty of defining and recognizing Neo-Renaissance architecture . A comparison between the breadth of its source material , such as the English Wollaton Hall , Italian Palazzo Pitti , the French Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord , and the Russian Palace of Facets - all deemed Renaissance - illustrates the variety of appearances the same architectural label can take .",
  "/wiki/The_New_Church": "The New Church ( or Swedenborgianism ) is the name for several historically related Christian denominations that developed as a new religious group , influenced by the writings of scientist and Swedish Lutheran theologian Emanuel Swedenborg ( 1688-1772 ) . According to Swedenborg , he received a new revelation from Christ in visions he experienced over a period of at least twenty-five years . He predicted in his writings that God would replace the traditional Christian Church , establishing a New Church that would worship Jesus Christ as God . According to New Church doctrine , each person must cooperate in repentance , reformation , and regeneration . The movement was founded on the belief that God explained the spiritual meaning of the Bible to Swedenborg to reveal the truth of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ . Swedenborg cited divine revelation for his writings , and his followers believe that he witnessed the Last Judgment in the spiritual world with the inauguration of the New Church . The church is seen by its members as what Jesus is establishing with those who believe that he is the one God of heaven and Earth , with obedience to Jesus 's commandments being necessary for salvation . It is thought that any Christian holding these beliefs is part of the New Church . New Church organizations acknowledge what they believe to be the universal nature of Jesus 's church : all who do good in accordance with the truth of their religion will be accepted by Jesus into heaven ( since God is goodness itself ) , and doing good joins one with God . Adherents believe that New Church doctrine is derived from the Bible and provides enlightenment of the truth ; this leads to diminished doubt , a recognition of personal faults , and a more-focused , happier life . Other names for the movement include Swedenborgian , New Christians , Neo-Christians , Church of the New Jerusalem , and The Lord 's New Church . Although those outside the church may refer to the movement as Swedenborgianism , some adherents distance themselves from this title ( which implies following Swedenborg , rather than Jesus ) .",

  "/wiki/Congregational_church": "Congregational churches ( also Congregationalist churches ; Congregationalism ) are Protestant churches in the Reformed tradition practicing congregationalist church governance , in which each congregation independently and autonomously runs its own affairs . Congregationalism , as defined by the Pew Research Center , is estimated to represent 0.5 percent of the worldwide Protestant population ; though their polity-related customs and other ideas influenced significant parts of Protestantism , as well as other Christian congregations . The report defines it very narrowly , encompassing mainly denominations in the United States and the United Kingdom , which can trace their history back to nonconforming Protestants , Puritans , Separatists , Independents , English religious groups coming out of the English Civil War , and other English dissenters not satisfied with the degree to which the Church of England had been reformed . Congregationalist tradition has a presence in the United States , the United Kingdom , Ireland , Canada , South Africa , Australia , New Zealand , and various island nations in the Pacific region . It has been introduced either by immigrant dissenter Protestants or by missionary organization such as the London Missionary Society . A number of evangelical Congregational churches are members of the World Evangelical Congregational Fellowship . In the United Kingdom , many Congregational churches claim their descent from Protestant denominations formed on a theory of union published by the theologian and English separatist Robert Browne in 1582 . Other accounts trace these origins further back to the London Underground Church of the 1560s . Ideas of nonconforming Protestants during the Puritan Reformation of the Church of England laid foundation for these churches . In England , the early Congregationalists were called Separatists or Independents to distinguish them from the similarly Calvinistic Presbyterians , whose churches embrace a polity based on the governance of elders . Congregationalists also differed with the Reformed churches using episcopalian church governance , which is usually led by a bishop . Congregationalism in the United States traces its origins to the Puritans of New England , who wrote the Cambridge Platform of 1648 to describe the autonomy of the church and its association with others .",
  "/wiki/London_stock_brick": "London stock brick is the type of handmade brick which was used for the majority of building work in London and South East England until the growth in the use of Flettons and other machine-made bricks in the early 20th century . Its distinctive yellow colour and soft appearance come from the yellow local clay from which the bricks were made . London Stocks are still made in comparatively small quantities in traditional brickworks , mainly in Kent and Sussex , for heritage work , and machine-made versions are available for use where a cheaper approximation to the traditional product is acceptable . Red stock bricks are also fairly common , but only the yellow or brown coloured bricks are usually known as London stocks .",

It was formed in 1857 by the amalgamation of the Wesleyan Association ( which had in 1836 largely absorbed the Protestant Methodists of 1828 ) and the Wesleyan Reformers ( dating from 1849 , when a number of Wesleyan Methodist ministers were expelled on a charge of insubordination ) . It merged with the Bible Christian Church and the Methodist New Connexion to form the United Methodist Church in 1907 .

  "/wiki/Course_(architecture)": "A course is a layer of the same unit running horizontally in a wall . It can also be defined as a continuous row of any masonry unit such as bricks , concrete masonry units ( CMU ) , stone , shingles , tiles , etc . Coursed masonry construction is that in which units are arranged in regular courses , and not irregularly . On the other hand , coursed rubble masonry construction is that in which units of random size , that are not cut down , are used to build courses and the in-between spaces are filled with mortar or smaller stones . If a course is the horizontal arrangement , then a wythe is the vertical section of a wall . A standard 8-inch CMU block is exactly equal to three courses of brick , so that is it easy to build a brick-on-CMU wall . A bond pattern ( or bonding pattern ) is the arrangement of several courses . The types of bond patterns can be found under Brickwork . When building a masonry wall the corners are first built and then the spaces between them are filled by the remaining courses .",

  "/wiki/Calvinism": "Calvinism ( also called the Reformed tradition , Reformed Christianity , Reformed Protestantism , or the Reformed faith ) is a major branch of Protestantism that follows the theological tradition and forms of Christian practice set down by John Calvin and other Reformation-era theologians . Calvinists broke from the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century . Calvinists differ from Lutherans on the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist , theories of worship , and the use of God 's law for believers , among other things . The term Calvinism can be misleading , because the religious tradition which it denotes has always been diverse , with a wide range of influences rather than a single founder ; however almost all of them drew heavily from the writings of Augustine of Hippo a millennium prior . In the context of the Reformation , Huldrych Zwingli began the Reformed tradition in 1519 in the city of Z\u00fcrich . His followers were instantly labeled Zwinglians , consistent with the Catholic practice of naming heresy after its founder . Very soon , Zwingli was joined by Martin Bucer , Wolfgang Capito , William Farel , Johannes Oecolampadius and other early Reformed thinkers . The namesake of the movement , French reformer John Calvin , renounced Roman Catholicism and embraced Protestant views in the late 1520s or early 1530s , as the earliest notions of later Reformed tradition were already espoused by Huldrych Zwingli . The movement was first called Calvinism , referring to John Calvin , by Lutherans who opposed it . Many within the tradition find it either an indescriptive or an inappropriate term and would prefer the word Reformed to be used instead . The most important Reformed theologians include Calvin , Zwingli , Martin Bucer , William Farel , Heinrich Bullinger , Peter Martyr Vermigli , Theodore Beza , and John Knox . In the twentieth century , Abraham Kuyper , Herman Bavinck , B ."
