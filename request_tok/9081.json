By many measures it is the largest ski resort in North America and has the greatest uphill lift capacity . It features the Peak 2 Peak Gondola for moving between Whistler and Blackcomb mountains at the top . With all of this capacity , Whistler Blackcomb is also often the busiest ski resort , often surpassing 2 million visitors a year . Whistler was originally conceived as part of a bid to win the 1968 Winter Olympics . Although the bid failed , construction started anyway and the resort opened for the first time in January 1966 . Blackcomb mountain , originally a separate entity , opened for business in December 1980 . The two resorts underwent a period of intense rivalry through the 1980s and 90s , with constant upgrades and improvements that were unseen at other resorts . By the mid-1990s the area was repeatedly named the best resort in many skiing magazines . Intrawest , the BC real estate firm that developed Blackcomb , purchased Whistler in 1997 and fully merged their operations in 2003 . Whistler Blackcomb was the centrepiece of a renewed bid on the part of nearby Vancouver for the 2010 Winter Olympics , which they won in July 2003 . Whistler Blackcomb hosted the alpine skiing events , including the men 's and women 's Olympic and Paralympic alpine skiing disciplines of downhill , Super-G , slalom , giant slalom and super combined .",
  "/wiki/Mogul_skiing": "Mogul skiing is a freestyle skiing competition consisting of one timed run of free skiing on a steep , heavily moguled course , stressing technical turns , aerial maneuvers and speed . Internationally , the sport is contested at the FIS Freestyle World Ski Championships , and at the Winter Olympic Games . Moguls are a series of bumps on a piste formed when skiers push snow into mounds as they do sharp turns . This tends to happen naturally as skiers use the slope but they can also be constructed artificially . Once formed , a naturally occurring mogul tends to grow as skiers follow similar paths around it , further deepening the surrounding grooves known as troughs . Since skiing tends to be a series of linked turns , moguls form together to create a bump field . The term mogul is from the Bavarian/Austrian German word Mugel , meaning mound , hillock .

  "/wiki/Tignes": "Tignes ( French pronunciation : \u200b [ ti\u0272 ] ) is a commune in the Tarentaise Valley , in the Savoie department in the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region in south-eastern France , known for the highest skiable area in Europe and the longest ski season in Europe . It is located in the Savoie region with good transport links in and out of Lyon , Geneva and Chambery . It is best known as a snow sure ski resort . Together with neighbouring Val d'Is\u00e8re , it forms the Espace Killy ski area . The proximity of two resorts offers one of the most seamless links between ski areas in Europe , in effect creating a single skiable area of over 300 km piste . Whilst not the largest ski area in the Alps , the level of integration between the two resorts has the effect of making it feel as one , often described as feeling like one of the largest single ski areas as a result . Tignes was the freestyle skiing venue for the 1992 Winter Olympics , co-host city for the 1992 Winter Paralympics and host of the Winter X Games . This , coupled with the year round skiing , season length and large number of ski parks/slalom runs has supplanted Tignes as the go to training ground for snow sport athletes . The terrain of valley lends itself to more challenging skiing , with advanced skiers often opting for the resort as their preferred ski area . The town has however strived to improve its appeal to beginner and intermediate skiers with the introduction of easier runs lower down in the valley towards Tignes-Les-Br\u00e9vi\u00e8res and upgrading/installing new chairlifts with smaller elevation gains .",
