  "/wiki/Bishop_National_Bank_of_Hawaii": "The Bishop National Bank of Hawaii was a bank in Hawaii . Its branch building on Hawaii Route 50 in Waimea , Kauai , Hawaii , was built in 1929 . That branch building has also been known as First Hawaiian Bank , as Bishop National Bank , Waimea Branch , and as Bishop First National Bank , Waimea Branch . The building includes Classical Revival architecture and was a work of architect John Mason and of J.L . Young Engineering Co . The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 . The building replaced a 1911 building that had been the second Bishop National Bank branch , after the first built in Hilo . According to its NRHP nomination , the building is important mainly for its architectural value . Its eclectic style and solid , imposing appearance is typical of post-World War I banking architecture . It is designed to give an aura of permanence and stability -- a visual assurance to Waimea 's inhabitants that the bank was 'here to stay . ':3",
