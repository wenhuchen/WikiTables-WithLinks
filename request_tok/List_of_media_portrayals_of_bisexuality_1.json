  "/wiki/8_Women": "8 Women ( French : 8 femmes ) is a 2002 French dark comedy musical film , written and directed by Fran\u00e7ois Ozon . Based on the 1958 play by Robert Thomas , it features an ensemble cast of high-profile French actresses that includes Danielle Darrieux , Catherine Deneuve , Isabelle Huppert , Emmanuelle B\u00e9art , Fanny Ardant , Virginie Ledoyen , Ludivine Sagnier , and Firmine Richard . Revolving around an eccentric family of women and their employees in the 1950s , the film follows eight women as they gather to celebrate Christmas in an isolated , snowbound cottage only to find Marcel , the family patriarch , dead with a knife in his back . Trapped in the house , every woman becomes a suspect , each having her own motive and secret . Ozon initially envisioned a remake of George Cukor 's film The Women ( 1939 ) , but eventually settled on Thomas 's Huit femmes after legal obstacles prevented him from doing so . Drawing inspiration from Cukor 's screwball comedies of the late 1930s and the 1950s work of directors such as Douglas Sirk , Vincente Minnelli , and Alfred Hitchcock , 8 Women blends farce , melodrama , musical , and murder-mystery film while addressing murder , greed , adultery , and homosexuality . Set primarily in the entry hall of a manor house , the film recreates much of the play 's original theatrical feel . It also serves as a pastiche of and homage to the history of film and the actresses ' filmographies . The film 's premiere was held on 8 January 2002 in Paris , where filming had taken place . 8 Women competed for the Golden Bear at the 52nd Berlin International Film Festival , where its all-female cast was awarded a Silver Bear for outstanding artistic contribution .
