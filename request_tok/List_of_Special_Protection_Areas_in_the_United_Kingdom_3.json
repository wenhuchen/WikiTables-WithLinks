Located in the northeast of the island of Ireland , Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland . In 2011 , its population was 1,810,863 , constituting about 30% of the island 's total population and about 3% of the UK 's population . Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement , the Northern Ireland Assembly ( colloquially referred to as Stormont after its location ) holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters , while other areas are reserved for the British government . Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in several areas , and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to put forward views and proposals with determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments . On 11 January 2020 , legislators in Northern Ireland formed a government for the first time since the Executive of the 5th Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed in January 2017 , following the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal . Northern Ireland was created in 1921 , when Ireland was partitioned between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 . Unlike Southern Ireland , which would become the Irish Free State in 1922 , the majority of Northern Ireland 's population were unionists , who wanted to remain within the United Kingdom . Most of these were the Protestant descendants of colonists from Great Britain . However , a significant minority , mostly Catholics , were nationalists who wanted a united Ireland independent of British rule . Today , the former generally see themselves as British and the latter generally see themselves as Irish , while a distinct Northern Irish or Ulster identity is claimed both by a large minority of Catholics and Protestants and by many of those who are non-aligned . For most of the 20th century , when it came into existence , Northern Ireland was marked by discrimination and hostility between these two sides in what First Minister of Northern Ireland , David Trimble , called a cold house for Catholics .",

The island is formed by stabilising shingle , gravel and stones overlain by a thin layer of soil . It is sited 550 m from the west shore of the lough and 3.1 km from the mouth . The ASSI is also an SPA ( Special Protection Area ) because it regularly supports internationally important numbers of light-bellied brent geese in winter . Swan Island , which was classified as an SPA in its own right in 1992 , qualifies because , in summer , it supports nationally important breeding populations of rosate and common terns . The nationally rare plant bur chervil can also be found in significant abundance on Swan Island . Small numbers of both Sandwich and Arctic terns also breed at this site .",
