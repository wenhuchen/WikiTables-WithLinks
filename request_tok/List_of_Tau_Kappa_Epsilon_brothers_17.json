  "/wiki/National_Football_League": "The National Football League ( NFL ) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams , divided equally between the National Football Conference ( NFC ) and the American Football Conference ( AFC ) . The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America and the highest professional level of American football in the world . The NFL 's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December , with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week . Following the conclusion of the regular season , six teams from each conference ( four division winners and two wild card teams ) advance to the playoffs , a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl , which is usually held on the first Sunday in February and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC . The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season . After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings , a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966 . Following an agreement to merge the NFL with the American Football League ( AFL ) , the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was completed in 1970 . Today , the NFL has the highest average attendance ( 67,591 ) of any professional sports league in the world and is the most popular sports league in the United States . The Super Bowl is also among the biggest club sporting events in the world , with the individual games accounting for many of the most watched television programs in American history and all occupying the Nielsen 's Top 5 tally of the all-time most watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015 .

  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",

  "/wiki/Tight_end": "The tight end ( TE ) is a position in American football , arena football , and formerly Canadian football , on the offense . The tight end is often seen as a hybrid position with the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a wide receiver . Like offensive linemen , they are usually lined up on the offensive line and are large enough to be effective blockers . On the other hand , unlike offensive linemen , they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense 's attention when running pass patterns . Because of the hybrid nature of the position , the tight end 's role in any given offense depends on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach . In some systems , the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman , rarely going out for passes . Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver , frequently taking advantage of the tight end 's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary . Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking on running plays while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in obvious passing situations . Offensive formations may have as few as zero or as many as three tight ends at one time .",

  "/wiki/American_Football_League": "The American Football League ( AFL ) was a major professional American football league that operated for ten seasons from 1960 until 1969 , when it merged with the older National Football League ( NFL ) , and became the American Football Conference . The upstart AFL operated in direct competition with the more established NFL throughout its existence . It was more successful than earlier rivals to the NFL with the same name , the 1926 , 1936 and 1940 leagues , and the later All-America Football Conference ( which existed between 1944 and 1950 but only played between 1946 and 1949 ) . This fourth version of the AFL was the most successful , created by a number of owners who had been refused NFL expansion franchises or had minor shares of NFL franchises . The AFL 's original lineup consisted of an Eastern division of the New York Titans , Boston Patriots , Buffalo Bills , and the Houston Oilers , and a Western division of the Los Angeles Chargers , Denver Broncos , Oakland Raiders , and Dallas Texans . The league first gained attention by signing 75% of the NFL 's first-round draft choices in 1960 , including Houston 's successful signing of college star and Heisman Trophy winner Billy Cannon . While the first years of the AFL saw uneven competition and low attendance , the league was buttressed by a generous television contract with the American Broadcasting Company ( ABC ) ( followed by a contract with the competing National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) for games starting with the 1965 season ) that broadcast the more offense-oriented football league nationwide . Continuing to attract top talent from colleges and the NFL by the mid-1960s , as well as successful franchise shifts of the Chargers from L.A. south to San Diego and the Texans north to Kansas City ( becoming the Kansas City Chiefs ) , the AFL established a dedicated following . The transformation of the struggling Titans into the New York Jets under new ownership further solidified the league 's reputation among the major media . As fierce competition made player salaries skyrocket in both leagues , especially after a series of raids , the leagues agreed to a merger in 1966 . Among the conditions were a common draft and a championship game played between the two league champions first played in early 1967 , which would eventually become known as the Super Bowl . The AFL and NFL operated as separate leagues until 1970 , with separate regular season and playoff schedules except for the championship game .",

  "/wiki/Defensive_tackle": "A defensive tackle ( DT ) is typically the largest and strongest of the defensive players in American football . The defensive tackle typically lines up opposite one of the offensive guards . Depending on a team 's individual defensive scheme , a defensive tackle may be called upon to fill several different roles . These roles may include merely holding the point of attack by refusing to be moved or penetrating a certain gap between offensive linemen to break up a play in the opponent 's backfield . If a defensive tackle reads a pass play , his primary responsibility is to pursue the quarterback , or simply knock the pass down at the line if it is within arm 's reach . Other responsibilities of the defensive tackle may be to pursue the screen pass or drop into coverage in a zone blitz scheme . In a traditional 4-3 defense , there is no nose tackle . Instead there is a left and right defensive tackle . Some teams , especially in the National Football League ( NFL ) , do have a nose tackle in this scheme , but most of them do not .",

  "/wiki/Pro_Bowl": "The Pro Bowl is the all-star game of the National Football League ( NFL ) .

From 2014 through 2016 , the NFL experimented with an unconferenced format , where the teams were selected by two honorary team captains ( who are each in the Hall of Fame ) , instead of selecting players from each conference . The players were picked in a televised schoolyard pick prior to the game . Unlike most major sports leagues , which hold their all-star games roughly midway through their regular seasons , the Pro Bowl is played around the end of the NFL season .

  "/wiki/All-Pro": "All-Pro is an honor bestowed upon professional American football players that designates the best player at each position during a given season . All-Pro players are typically selected by press organizations , who select an All-Pro team , a list that consists of at least 22 players , one for each offensive and defensive position , plus various special teams players depending on the press organization that compiles the list . All-Pro lists are exclusively limited to the major leagues , usually only the National Football League ; in the past , other leagues recognized as major , such as the American Football League of the 1960s or the All-America Football Conference of the 1940s , have been included in All-Pro lists . Beginning in the early 1920s , All-Pro teams have traditionally been assembled from press polls of individually voting sportswriters . After polling the writers , the votes are tallied to determine the selected players and the results have historically been published through various news syndicates . Today , the teams are mostly published online or announced on various televised sports programs . Some organizations publish two All-Pro lists , a First Team and a Second Team , with the first consisting of more prominent players than the second . The Associated Press ( AP ) and its All-Pro selections are the most widely recognized today . Other polls include the United Press International All-Pro poll , which began in the 1940s and continued in various forms until 1997 , the Newspaper Enterprise Association All-Pro team , which ran from 1954 until 1996 , and the Pro Football Writers Association All-Pro teams , which were inaugurated in 1966 and continue to be released annually . The NFL itself compiled official All-Pro lists beginning in 1931 but abandoned the practice in 1942 . The All-Pro designation , while not officially sanctioned by the NFL , is generally considered a more prestigious honor than the NFL 's official all-star designation , a Pro Bowl recognition : a minimum of twice as many Pro Bowlers are selected as first and second team All-Pro slots combined , and Pro Bowl selections often drop out , allowing a lesser player to also receive the honor by default , which does not occur with the All-Pro list .",
