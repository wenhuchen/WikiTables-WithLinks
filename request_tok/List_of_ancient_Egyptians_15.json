  "/wiki/Pharaoh": "Pharaoh is the common title of the monarchs of ancient Egypt from the First Dynasty ( c. 3150 BCE ) until the annexation of Egypt by the Roman Empire in 30 BCE , although the actual term Pharaoh was not used contemporaneously for a ruler until Merneptah , c. 1200 BCE . In the early dynasty , ancient Egyptian kings used to have up to three titles , the Horus , the Sedge and Bee ( nswt-bjtj ) name , and the Two Ladies ( nbtj ) name . The Golden Horus and nomen and prenomen titles were later added . In Egyptian society , religion was central to everyday life . One of the roles of the pharaoh was as an intermediary between the gods and the people . The pharaoh thus deputised for the gods ; his role was both as civil and religious administrator . He owned all of the land in Egypt , enacted laws , collected taxes , and defended Egypt from invaders as the commander-in-chief of the army . Religiously , the pharaoh officiated over religious ceremonies and chose the sites of new temples . He was responsible for maintaining Maat ( m\ua723\ua725t ) , or cosmic order , balance , and justice , and part of this included going to war when necessary to defend the country or attacking others when it was believed that this would contribute to Maat , such as to obtain resources . During the early days prior to the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt , the Deshret or the Red Crown , was a representation of the kingdom of Lower Egypt , while the Hedjet , the White Crown , was worn by the kings of the kingdom of Upper Egypt . After the unification of both kingdoms into one united Egypt , the Pschent , the combination of both the red and white crowns was the official crown of kings . With time new headdresses were introduced during different dynasties like the Khat , Nemes , Atef , Hemhem crown , and Khepresh .",

He was the seventh ruler of the Fifth Dynasty at the end of the 25th century BC or early in the 24th century BC ( circa 2399-2390 BC ) . Menkauhor ruled for possibly eight or nine years , following king Nyuserre Ini , and was succeeded in turn by Djedkare Isesi . Although Menkauhor is well attested by historical sources , few artifacts from his reign have survived . Consequently , his familial relation to his predecessor and successor is unclear , and no offspring of his have been identified . Khentkaus III may have been Menkauhor 's mother , as indicated by evidence discovered in her tomb in 2015 . Beyond the construction of monuments , the only known activity dated to Menkauhor 's reign is an expedition to the copper and turquoise mines in Sinai . Menkauhor ordered the construction of a sun temple , called the Akhet-Ra , meaning The Horizon of Ra . The last ever to be built , this sun temple , known from inscriptions found in the tombs of its priests , is yet to be located . Menkauhor was buried in a small pyramid in Saqqara , which the Ancient Egyptians named Netjer-Isut Menkauhor , The Divine Places of Menkauhor . Known today as the Headless Pyramid , the ruin had been lost under shifting sands until its rediscovery in 2008 . The figure of Menkauhor was at the centre of a long lasting funerary cult until the end of the Old Kingdom period , with at least seven agricultural domains producing goods for the necessary offerings .",

Saqqara features numerous pyramids , including the world-famous Step pyramid of Djoser , sometimes referred to as the Step Tomb due to its rectangular base , as well as a number of mastabas ( Arabic word meaning 'bench ' ) . Located some 30 km ( 19 mi ) south of modern-day Cairo , Saqqara covers an area of around 7 by 1.5 km ( 4.35 by 0.93 mi ) . At Saqqara , the oldest complete stone building complex known in history was built ; Djoser 's step pyramid , built during the Third Dynasty . Another 16 Egyptian kings built pyramids at Saqqara , which are now in various states of preservation or dilapidation . High officials added private funeral monuments to this necropolis during the entire pharaonic period . It remained an important complex for non-royal burials and cult ceremonies for more than 3,000 years , well into Ptolemaic and Roman times . North of the area known as Saqqara lies Abusir , and south lies Dahshur . The area running from Giza to Dahshur has been used as a necropolis by the inhabitants of Memphis at different times , and it was designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979 . Some scholars believe that the name Saqqara is not derived from the ancient Egyptian funerary deity , Sokar , but supposedly , from a local Berber Tribe called Beni Saqqar .",

Huni 's chronological position as the last king of the third dynasty is seen as fairly certain , but there is still some uncertainty on the succession order of rulers at the end of the 3rd dynasty . It is also unclear under which Hellenized name the ancient historian Manetho could have listed him in his historical writing Aegyptiacae . Most possibly he is to be identified with the Hellenized name Aches , as Winfried Barta proposes . Many Egyptologists believe that Huni was the father and direct predecessor of king Sneferu , but this is questioned by other scholars . Huni is seen by scholars as a confusing figure in Egyptian history , because he was long remembered in Egyptian traditions , but only very few documents , objects or monuments have endured .",

Due to this , he is considered the man who restabilized his country after the troublesome and divisive Amarna Period . Horemheb demolished monuments of Akhenaten , reusing their remains in his own building projects , and usurped monuments of Tutankhamun and Ay .

Her titles shown that she was the daughter , sister , wife and mother of kings . In the past some thought she was married to Ramesses X , and that both she and her husband were the children of Ramesses IX , and their son was Ramesses XI . But another theory by Jehon Grist placed her earlier in the 20th dynasty and identifies her as a daughter-wife of Ramesses III and the mother of Ramesses IV , based on the similarities in style of her tomb and those of princes who lived during this period . However , judging from the age of their child this would mean that Ramesses married his daughter before he ascended the throne , and father-daughter marriages occurred only between pharaohs and their daughters . Tyti is depicted with a type of crown that is , according to one theory , an attribute of princess-queens ( 19th dynasty princess-queen Nebettawy was shown with this crown and 18th dynasty Sitamun wore an earlier version of it ) . Now , however , new scholarly research printed in the 2010 issue of JEA clearly establishes that Queen Tyti was in fact Ramesses III 's wife based on certain copies of parts of the tomb robbery papyri ( or Papyrus BM EA 10052 ) - made by Anthony Harris - which discloses confessions made by Egyptian tomb robbers who broke into Tyti 's tomb and emptied it of its jewellery . Tyti is named as a queen of pharaoh Ramesses III which means that she was most likely king Ramesses IV 's own mother since Ramesses VI is known to be the son of another queen of Ramesses III named Iset Ta-Hemdjert . Even the Egyptologist Aidan Dodson who doubted Grist 's theory on the identity of Tyti 's royal husband now accepts this new evidence since it comes from newly deciphered notes of this tomb robbery papyrus made by Anthony Harris .

  "/wiki/Ramesses_XI": "Menmaatre Ramesses XI ( also written Ramses and Rameses ) reigned from 1107 BC to 1078 BC or 1077 BC and was the tenth and final pharaoh of the Twentieth dynasty of Egypt and as such , was the last king of the New Kingdom period . He ruled Egypt for at least 29 years although some Egyptologists think he could have ruled for as long as 30 . The latter figure would be up to 2 years beyond this king 's highest known date of Year 10 of the Whm Mswt era or Year 28 of his reign . One scholar , Ad Thijs , has suggested that Ramesses XI could even have reigned as long as 33 years . It is believed that Ramesses ruled into his Year 29 since a graffito records that the general and High Priest of Amun Piankh returned to Thebes from Nubia on III Shemu day 23 - or just 3 days into what would have been the start of Ramesses XI 's 29th regnal year . Piankh is known to have campaigned in Nubia during Year 28 of Ramesses XI 's reign ( or Year 10 of the Whm Mswt ) and would have returned home to Egypt in the following year .",

  "/wiki/Smendes": "Hedjkheperre Setepenre Smendes was the founder of the Twenty-first dynasty of Egypt and succeeded to the throne after burying Ramesses XI in Lower Egypt - territory which he controlled . His Egyptian nomen or birth name was actually Nesbanebdjed meaning He of the Ram , Lord of Mendes , [ citation needed ] but it was translated into Greek as Smendes by later classical writers such as Josephus and Sextus Africanus . While Smendes ' precise origins remain a mystery , he is thought to have been a powerful governor in Lower Egypt during the Renaissance era of Ramesses XI and his base of power was Tanis .

  "/wiki/Isetnofret": "Isetnofret ( or Isis-nofret or Isitnofret ) ( Ancient Egyptian : the beautiful Isis ) was one of the Great Royal Wives of Pharaoh Ramesses II and was the mother of his heir , Merneptah . She was one of the most prominent of the royal wives , along with Nefertari , and was the chief queen after Nefertari 's death ( around the 24th year of the pharaoh 's reign ) .",
  "/wiki/Ramesses-Meryamun-Nebweben": "Ramesses-Meryamun-Nebweben was an Ancient Egyptian prince , a son of Pharaoh Ramesses II . Since he is not shown or mentioned anywhere among the children of Ramesses , he is likely to have been one of the youngest of Ramesses ' sons . He is known to us only from the inscriptions of his coffins . The identity of his mother is unknown . He spent his life in the Mer-wer harem , and was buried nearby after his death in his 30s . His body was found , and it is apparent that he had a deformed spine and was hunchbacked . It is likely that because of his deformity it was difficult to find an adequate coffin for him . He was buried in an unused outer coffin of his great-grandfather , which Ramesses I had had made when he was still a vizier . Although the inner coffin was also altered for Ramesses-Meryamun-Nebweben 's burial , and the inscriptions were changed to his name instead of that of his great-grandfather , only the outer coffin was used , and the inner one was found by archeologists in a pit in Medinet Habu . Unlike several of his brothers , whose name also includes the name Ramesses , in his name Ramesses Meryamun was enclosed in a cartouche , making it explicit that it is not used in its literal meaning ( Born of R\u00ea , Beloved of Amun ) but refers to the pharaoh . Nebweben means lord of sunshine , the meaning of the prince 's name is thus Pharaoh Ramesses is the Lord of Sunshine . Such names , glorifying the pharaoh , are often found as names taken by high officials , but are relatively rare as given names within the royal family during the New Kingdom .",
  "/wiki/Ramessesnakht": "Ramessesnakht was High Priest of Amun during many years in the 20th Dynasty . He was appointed as the High Priest at Thebes under Ramesses IV . He served in office until the reign of Ramesses IX .

  "/wiki/Ramose_(prince)": "Ramose was an ancient Egyptian prince of the eighteenth dynasty ; probably the son of Pharaoh Ahmose I . He is depicted in the 20th dynasty tomb of Inherthaui ( TT359 ) among the Lords of the West with several of his family members and a few important pharaohs ( among the depicted are ( Amenhotep I , Ahmose I , Ahhotep , Ahmose Meritamon , Ahmose Sitamun , Siamun , Ahmose Henuttamehu , Ahmose Tumerisy , Ahmose Nebetta , Ahmose Sipair , Ahmose Nefertari , Ramesses I , Mentuhotep II , Amenhotep II , Seqenenre Tao II , Ramesses IV , Thutmose I ) . A statue of his is owned by the University of Liverpool .",
  "/wiki/Ahmose_I": "Ahmose I ( Ancient Egyptian : j\ua725\u1e25 ms ( j.w ) , reconstructed /\u0294a\u0280a\u0127'ma : sj\u0259/ ( MK ) , Egyptological pronunciation Ahmose , sometimes written as Amosis or Aahmes , meaning Iah ( the Moon ) is born ) was a pharaoh and founder of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt . He was a member of the Theban royal house , the son of pharaoh Seqenenre Tao and brother of the last pharaoh of the Seventeenth dynasty , Kamose . During the reign of his father or grandfather , Thebes rebelled against the Hyksos , the rulers of Lower Egypt . When he was seven years old , his father was killed , and he was about ten when his brother died of unknown causes after reigning only three years . Ahmose I assumed the throne after the death of his brother , and upon coronation became known as nb-p\u1e25tj-r\ua725 The Lord of Strength is Ra . During his reign , Ahmose completed the conquest and expulsion of the Hyksos from the Nile Delta , restored Theban rule over the whole of Egypt and successfully reasserted Egyptian power in its formerly subject territories of Nubia and Canaan . He then reorganized the administration of the country , reopened quarries , mines and trade routes and began massive construction projects of a type that had not been undertaken since the time of the Middle Kingdom . This building program culminated in the construction of the last pyramid built by native Egyptian rulers . Ahmose 's reign laid the foundations for the New Kingdom , under which Egyptian power reached its peak . His reign is usually dated to the mid-16th century BC .",
  "/wiki/Ramose_(TT55)": "The Ancient Egyptian noble , Ramose was Vizier under both Amenhotep III and Akhenaten . He was in office in the last decade of Amenhotep 's III reign and at the beginning of the reign of the latter king . Ramose appears on jar labels found in the palace of king Amenhotep III at Malkata . Here appears also the vizier Amenhotep-Huy . Both viziers are also shown side by side in the temple of Soleb . In the New Kingdom the office of the vizier was divided in a northern vizier and a southern one . It is not entirely clear whether Ramose was the southern or northern one . Ramose was born into an influential family . His father was the mayor of Memphis Heby , in office at the beginning of Amenhotep 's III reign . The brother of Ramose was the high steward of Memphis Amenhotep ( Huy ) .",
  "/wiki/Amenhotep_III": "Amenhotep III ( Hellenized as Amenophis III ; Egyptian Am\u0101na-\u1e24\u0101tpa ; meaning Amun is Satisfied ) , also known as Amenhotep the Magnificent , was the ninth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty . According to different authors , he ruled Egypt from June 1386 to 1349 BC , or from June 1388 BC to December 1351 BC/1350 BC , after his father Thutmose IV died . Amenhotep III was Thutmose 's son by a minor wife , Mutemwiya . His reign was a period of unprecedented prosperity and splendour , when Egypt reached the peak of its artistic and international power . When he died in the 38th or 39th year of his reign , his son initially ruled as Amenhotep IV , but then changed his own royal name to Akhenaten .",
  "/wiki/Akhenaten": "Akhenaten ( /\u02cc\u00e6k\u0259\u02c8n\u0251\u02d0t\u0259n/ ; also spelled Echnaton , Akhenaton , Ikhnaton , and Khuenaten ; meaning Effective for Aten ) , known before the fifth year of his reign as Amenhotep IV ( sometimes given its Greek form , Amenophis IV , and meaning Amun Is Satisfied ) , was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty , who ruled for 17 years and died perhaps in 1336 BC or 1334 BC . He is noted for abandoning traditional Egyptian polytheism and introducing worship centered on the Aten ( notably instead of Amun , the temples of which he destroyed , the name of whom he rubbed off and the priests of whom he left without resources ) , which is sometimes described as monolatristic , henotheistic , or even quasi-monotheistic . An early inscription likens the Aten to the sun as compared to stars , and later official language avoids calling the Aten a god , giving the solar deity a status above mere gods . Akhenaten tried to shift his culture from Egypt 's traditional religion , but the shifts were not widely accepted . After his death , his monuments were dismantled and hidden , his statues were destroyed , and his name excluded from the king lists . Traditional religious practice was gradually restored , and when some dozen years later rulers without clear rights of succession from the 18th Dynasty founded a new dynasty , they discredited Akhenaten and his immediate successors , referring to Akhenaten himself as the enemy or that criminal in archival records . The stele of Merneptah values Amun who is represented giving the cemetery of victory to him , and is written on the back of a stele of Akhenaten stolen from one of his temples in Karnak . He was all but lost from history until the discovery during the 19th century of the site of Akhetaten , the city he built and designed for the worship of Aten , at Amarna . Early excavations at Amarna by Flinders Petrie sparked interest in the enigmatic pharaoh , and a mummy found in the tomb KV55 , which was unearthed in 1907 in a dig led by Edward R. Ayrton , is likely that of Akhenaten . DNA analysis has determined that the man buried in KV55 is the father of King Tutankhamun , but its identification as Akhenaten has been questioned . Modern interest in Akhenaten and his queen Nefertiti comes partly from his connection with Tutankhamun ( even though Tutankhamun 's mother was not Nefertiti , but a woman named by archaeologists The Younger Lady ) , partly from the unique style and high quality of the pictorial arts he patronized , and partly from ongoing interest in the religion he attempted to establish ."
