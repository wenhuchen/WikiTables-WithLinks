  "/wiki/Common_name": "In biology , a common name of a taxon or organism ; also known as a vernacular name ( local name ) , English name , colloquial name , trivial name , trivial epithet , country name , popular name , or farmer 's name ; is a name that is based on the normal language of everyday life ; this kind of name is often contrasted with the scientific name for the same organism , which is Latinized . A common name is sometimes frequently used , but that is by no means always the case . Sometimes common names are created by authorities on one particular subject , in an attempt to make it possible for members of the general public ( including such interested parties as fishermen , farmers , etc . ) to be able to refer to one particular species of organism without needing to be able to memorise or pronounce the Latinized scientific name . Creating an official list of common names can also be an attempt to standardize the use of common names , which can sometimes vary a great deal between one part of a country and another , as well as between one country and another country , even where the same language is spoken in both places .",
  "/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature": "Binomial nomenclature ( two-term naming system ) , also called binominal nomenclature ( two-name naming system ) or binary nomenclature , is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts , both of which use Latin grammatical forms , although they can be based on words from other languages . Such a name is called a binomial name ( which may be shortened to just binomial ) , a binomen , binominal name or a scientific name ; more informally it is also called a Latin name . The first part of the name - the generic name - identifies the genus to which the species belongs , while the second part - the specific name or specific epithet - identifies the species within the genus . For example , humans belong to the genus Homo and within this genus to the species Homo sapiens . Tyrannosaurus rex is probably the most widely known binomial . The formal introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus , effectively beginning with his work Species Plantarum in 1753 . But Gaspard Bauhin , in as early as 1622 , had introduced in his book Pinax theatri botanici ( English , Illustrated exposition of plants ) many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus . The application of binomial nomenclature is now governed by various internationally agreed codes of rules , of which the two most important are the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) for animals and the International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants ( ICNafp ) . Although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes , there are some differences , both in the terminology they use and in their precise rules . In modern usage , the first letter of the first part of the name , the genus , is always capitalized in writing , while that of the second part is not , even when derived from a proper noun such as the name of a person or place . Similarly , both parts are italicized when a binomial name occurs in normal text ( or underlined in handwriting ) . Thus the binomial name of the annual phlox ( named after botanist Thomas Drummond ) is now written as Phlox drummondii .",

  "/wiki/Roberts_County,_South_Dakota": "Roberts County is a county in the U.S. state of South Dakota . As of the 2010 United States Census , the population was 10,149 . Its county seat is Sisseton . The county was named either for S. G. Roberts of Fargo , North Dakota , or for Solomon Robar , an early local French fur trader . It was created on March 8 , 1883 , and was fully organized by August 6 of that year . Its boundary was altered one time , in 1885 .",
  "/wiki/Animal_colouration": "Animal coloration is the general appearance of an animal resulting from the reflection or emission of light from its surfaces . Some animals are brightly colored , while others are hard to see . In some species , such as the peafowl , the male has strong patterns , conspicuous colors and is iridescent , while the female is far less visible . There are several separate reasons why animals have evolved colors . Camouflage enables an animal to remain hidden from view . Animals use color to advertise services such as cleaning to animals of other species ; to signal their sexual status to other members of the same species ; and in mimicry , taking advantage of the warning coloration of another species . Some animals use flashes of color to divert attacks by startling predators . Zebras may possibly use motion dazzle , confusing a predator 's attack by moving a bold pattern rapidly . Some animals are colored for physical protection , with pigments in the skin to protect against sunburn , while some frogs can lighten or darken their skin for temperature regulation . Finally , animals can be colored incidentally . For example , blood is red because the heme pigment needed to carry oxygen is red . Animals colored in these ways can have striking natural patterns .",

Nine subspecies are currently recognized , including the nominotypical subspecies , Pituophis catenifer catenifer , described here . This snake is often mistaken for the prairie rattlesnake , but can be easily distinguished from a rattlesnake by the lack of black and white banding on its tail and by the shape of its head , which is narrower than a rattlesnake 's .",
  "/wiki/Missouri_river": "The Missouri River is the longest river in North America . Rising in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana , the Missouri flows east and south for 2,341 miles ( 3,767 km ) before entering the Mississippi River north of St. Louis , Missouri . The river drains a sparsely populated , semi-arid watershed of more than 500,000 square miles ( 1,300,000 km2 ) , which includes parts of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces . Although nominally considered a tributary of the Mississippi , the Missouri River above the confluence is much longer and carries a comparable volume of water . When combined with the lower Mississippi River , it forms the world 's fourth longest river system . For over 12,000 years , people have depended on the Missouri River and its tributaries as a source of sustenance and transportation . More than ten major groups of Native Americans populated the watershed , most leading a nomadic lifestyle and dependent on enormous bison herds that roamed through the Great Plains . The first Europeans encountered the river in the late seventeenth century , and the region passed through Spanish and French hands before becoming part of the United States through the Louisiana Purchase . The Missouri River was one of the main routes for the westward expansion of the United States during the 19th century . The growth of the fur trade in the early 19th century laid much of the groundwork as trappers explored the region and blazed trails . Pioneers headed west en masse beginning in the 1830s , first by covered wagon , then by the growing numbers of steamboats that entered service on the river . Settlers took over former Native American lands in the watershed , leading to some of the most longstanding and violent wars against indigenous peoples in American history .",
  "/wiki/Bank_(geography)": "In geography , a bank is the land alongside a body of water . Different structures are referred to as banks in different fields of geography , as follows . In limnology ( the study of inland waters ) , a stream bank or river bank is the terrain alongside the bed of a river , creek , or stream . The bank consists of the sides of the channel , between which the flow is confined . Stream banks are of particular interest in fluvial geography , which studies the processes associated with rivers and streams and the deposits and landforms created by them . Bankfull discharge is a discharge great enough to fill the channel and overtop the banks . The descriptive terms left bank and right bank refer to the perspective of an observer looking downstream , a well-known example of this being the sections of Paris as defined by the river Seine . The shoreline of ponds , swamps , estuaries , reservoirs , or lakes are also of interest in limnology and are sometimes referred to as banks . The grade of all these banks or shorelines can vary from vertical to a shallow slope . In freshwater ecology , banks are of interest as the location of riparian habitats . Riparian zones occur along upland and lowland river and stream beds . The ecology around and depending on a marsh , swamp , slough , or estuary , sometimes called a bank , is likewise studied in freshwater ecology .",

  "/wiki/Subspecies": "In biological classification , the term subspecies refers to one of two or more populations of a species living in different subdivisions of the species ' range and varying from one another by morphological characteristics . A single subspecies can not be recognized independently : a species is either recognized as having no subspecies at all or at least two , including any that are extinct . The term may be abbreviated to subsp . or ssp . The plural is the same as the singular : subspecies . In zoology , under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature , the subspecies is the only taxonomic rank below that of species that can receive a name . In botany and mycology , under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants , other infraspecific ranks , such as variety , may be named . In bacteriology and virology , under standard bacterial nomenclature and virus nomenclature , there are recommendations but not strict requirements for recognizing other important infraspecific ranks . A taxonomist decides whether to recognize a subspecies . A common criterion for recognizing two distinct populations as subspecies rather than full species is the ability of them to interbreed without a fitness penalty . In the wild , subspecies do not interbreed due to geographic isolation or sexual selection . The differences between subspecies are usually less distinct than the differences between species .",

  "/wiki/Venomous_snake": "Venomous snakes are species of the suborder Serpentes that are capable of producing venom , which they use for killing prey , for defense , and to assist with digestion of their prey . The venom is typically delivered by injection using hollow or grooved fangs , although some venomous snakes lack well-developed fangs . Common venomous snakes include the families Elapidae , Viperidae , Atractaspididae , and some of the Colubridae . The toxicity of venom is mainly indicated by murine LD50 , while multiple factors are considered to judge the potential danger to humans . Other important factors for risk assessment include the likelihood that a snake will bite , the quantity of venom delivered with the bite , the efficiency of the delivery mechanism , and the location of a bite on the body of the victim . Snake venom may have both neurotoxic and hemotoxic properties .",
  "/wiki/Pit_viper": "The Crotalinae , commonly known as pit vipers , crotaline snakes ( named for the Ancient Greek : \u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd krotalon castanet/rattle of a rattlesnake 's tail ) , or pit adders , are a subfamily of venomous vipers found in Eurasia and the Americas . They are distinguished by the presence of a heat-sensing pit organ located between the eye and the nostril on both sides of the head . Currently , 18 genera and 151 species are recognized : seven genera and 54 species in the Old World , against a greater diversity of 11 genera and 97 species in the New World . These are also the only viperids found in the Americas . The groups of snakes represented here include rattlesnakes , lanceheads , and Asian pit vipers . The type genus for this subfamily is Crotalus , of which the type species is the timber rattlesnake , C. horridus . [ citation needed ] These snakes range in size from the diminutive hump-nosed viper , Hypnale hypnale , that grows to an average total length ( including tail ) of only 30-45 cm ( 12-18 in ) , to the bushmaster , Lachesis muta , a species known to reach a maximum total length of 3.65 m ( 12.0 ft ) in length . What makes this subfamily unique is that all member species share a common characteristic : a deep pit , or fossa , in the loreal area between the eye and the nostril on either side of the head . These loreal pits are the external openings to a pair of extremely sensitive infrared-detecting organs , which in effect give the snakes a sixth sense to help them find and perhaps even judge the size of the small , warm-blooded prey on which they feed . Osine triphosphate , monoamine oxidase , generalized esterases and acetylcholine esterase have also been found in it . When prey comes into range , infrared radiation falling onto the membrane allows the snake to determine its direction .",

Black Elk Peak ( formerly known as Harney Peak ) , which rises to 7,244 feet ( 2,208 m ) , is the range 's highest summit . The Black Hills encompass the Black Hills National Forest . The name Black Hills is a translation of the Lakota Pah\u00e1 S\u00e1pa . The hills were so-called because of their dark appearance from a distance , as they were covered in trees . Native Americans have a long history in the Black Hills . After conquering the Cheyenne in 1776 , the Lakota took the territory of the Black Hills , which became central to their culture . In 1868 , the U.S. government signed the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868 , establishing the Great Sioux Reservation west of the Missouri River , and exempting the Black Hills from all white settlement forever . However , when settlers discovered gold there in 1874 , as a result of George Armstrong Custer 's Black Hills Expedition , miners swept into the area in a gold rush . The US government took back the Black Hills and in 1889 reassigned the Lakota , against their wishes , to five smaller reservations in western South Dakota , selling off 9 million acres of their former land . Unlike most of South Dakota , the Black Hills were settled by European Americans primarily from population centers to the west and south of the region , as miners flocked there from earlier gold boom locations in Colorado and Montana . As the economy of the Black Hills has shifted from natural resources ( mining and timber ) since the late 20th century , the hospitality and tourism industries have grown to take its place .",

  "/wiki/Diadophis_punctatus": "Diadophis punctatus , commonly known as the ring-necked snake or ringneck snake , is a harmless species of colubrid snake found throughout much of the United States , central Mexico , and southeastern Canada . Ring-necked snakes are secretive , nocturnal snakes , so are rarely seen during the day time . They are slightly venomous , but their nonaggressive nature and small , rear-facing fangs pose little threat to humans who wish to handle them . They are best known for their unique defense posture of curling up their tails , exposing their bright red-orange posterior , ventral surface when threatened . Ring-necked snakes are believed to be fairly abundant throughout most of their range , though no scientific evaluation supports this hypothesis .

  "/wiki/Riverine": "A river is a natural flowing watercourse , usually freshwater , flowing towards an ocean , sea , lake or another river . In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water . Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream , creek , brook , rivulet , and rill . There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features , although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size . Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location ; examples are run in some parts of the United States , burn in Scotland and northeast England , and beck in northern England . Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek , but not always : the language is vague . Rivers are part of the hydrological cycle . Water generally collects in a river from precipitation through a drainage basin from surface runoff and other sources such as groundwater recharge , springs , and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks ( e.g. , from glaciers ) . Rivers and streams are often considered major features within a landscape , however , they actually only cover around 0.1% of the land on Earth . They are made more obvious and significant to humans by the fact that many human cities and civilizations are built around the freshwater supplied by rivers and streams . Most of the major cities of the world are situated on the banks of rivers , as they are , or were , used as a source of water , for obtaining food , for transport , as borders , as a defensive measure , as a source of hydropower to drive machinery , for bathing , and as a means of disposing of waste . Potamology is the scientific study of rivers , while limnology is the study of inland waters in general .",
  "/wiki/Wetland": "A wetland is a distinct ecosystem that is flooded by water , either permanently or seasonally , where oxygen-free processes prevail . The primary factor that distinguishes wetlands from other land forms or water bodies is the characteristic vegetation of aquatic plants , adapted to the unique hydric soil . Wetlands play a number of functions , including water purification , water storage , processing of carbon and other nutrients , stabilization of shorelines , and support of plants and animals . Wetlands are also considered the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems , serving as home to a wide range of plant and animal life . Whether any individual wetland performs these functions , and the degree to which it performs them , depends on characteristics of that wetland and the lands and waters near it . Methods for rapidly assessing these functions , wetland ecological health , and general wetland condition have been developed in many regions and have contributed to wetland conservation partly by raising public awareness of the functions and the ecosystem services some wetlands provide . Wetlands occur naturally on every continent . The main wetland types are swamp , marsh , bog , and fen ; sub-types include mangrove forest , carr , pocosin , floodplains , mire , vernal pool , sink , and many others . Many peatlands are wetlands . The water in wetlands is either freshwater , brackish , or saltwater . Wetlands can be tidal ( inundated by tides ) or non-tidal . The largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin , the West Siberian Plain , the Pantanal in South America , and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta .",
