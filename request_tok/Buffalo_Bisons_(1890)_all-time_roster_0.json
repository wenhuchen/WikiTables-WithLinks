He played six seasons in Major League Baseball with the Milwaukee Brewers ( 1884 ) , Detroit Wolverines ( 1885-1888 ) , Brooklyn Bridegrooms ( 1890 ) , and Buffalo Bisons ( 1890 ) . Baldwin had his best season in 1886 when he compiled a 42-13 record and a 2.24 earned run average ( ERA ) , threw 55 complete games , and led the National League with 323 strikeouts . Baldwin 's 42 wins in 1886 set the major league record for a left-handed pitcher and remains the second highest single season total by a southpaw . Baldwin also pitched five complete games for a 4-1 record and a 1.50 ERA in the 1887 World Series . Arm troubles cut short Baldwin 's major league career at age 31 .",
  "/wiki/Pitcher": "In baseball , the pitcher is the player who throws the baseball from the pitcher 's mound toward the catcher to begin each play , with the goal of retiring a batter , who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the pitcher is assigned the number 1 . The pitcher is often considered the most important player on the defensive side of the game , and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum . There are many different types of pitchers , such as the starting pitcher , relief pitcher , middle reliever , lefty specialist , setup man , and the closer . Traditionally , the pitcher also bats . Starting in 1973 with the American League and spreading to further leagues throughout the 1980s and 1990s , the hitting duties of the pitcher have generally been given over to the position of designated hitter , a cause of some controversy . The National League in Major League Baseball and the Japanese Central League are among the remaining leagues that have not adopted the designated hitter position .",

  "/wiki/Outfielder": "An outfielder is a person playing in one of the three defensive positions in baseball or softball , farthest from the batter . These defenders are the left fielder , the center fielder , and the right fielder . As an outfielder , their duty is to catch fly balls and/ ground balls then to return them to the infield for the out or before the runner advances , if there is any runners on the bases . As an outfielder , they normally play behind the six players located in the field . By convention , each of the nine defensive positions in baseball is numbered . The outfield positions are 7 ( left field ) , 8 ( center field ) and 9 ( right field ) . These numbers are shorthand designations useful in baseball scorekeeping and are not necessarily the same as the squad numbers worn on player uniforms . Outfielders named to the MLB All-Century Team are Hank Aaron , Ty Cobb , Joe DiMaggio , Mickey Mantle , Willie Mays , Stan Musial , Pete Rose , Babe Ruth , Ted Williams and Ken Griffey Jr .",

  "/wiki/Run_batted_in": "A run batted in ( RBI ) , plural runs batted in ( RBI or RBIs ) , is a statistic in baseball and softball that credits a batter for making a play that allows a run to be scored ( except in certain situations such as when an error is made on the play ) . For example , if the batter bats a base hit , then another player on a higher base can head home to score a run , and the batter gets credited with batting in that run . Before the 1920 Major League Baseball season , runs batted in were not an official baseball statistic . Nevertheless , the RBI statistic was tabulated - unofficially - from 1907 through 1919 by baseball writer Ernie Lanigan , according to the Society for American Baseball Research . Common nicknames for an RBI include ribby ( or ribbie ) , rib , and ribeye . The plural of RBI is generally RBIs , although some commentators use RBI as both singular and plural , as it can also stand for runs batted in .",
  "/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)": "In baseball , the batting average ( BA ) is the number of hits divided by at bats . It is usually rounded to three decimal places and read without the decimal : A player with a batting average of .300 is batting three-hundred . If necessary to break ties , batting averages could be taken beyond the .001 measurement . In this context , .001 is considered a point , such that a .235 batter is 5 points higher than a .230 batter .",
  "/wiki/At_bat": "In baseball , an at bat ( AB ) or time at bat is a batter 's turn batting against a pitcher . An at bat is different from a plate appearance . A batter is credited with a plate appearance regardless of what happens during their turn at bat , but a batter is credited with an at bat only if that plate appearance does not have one of the results enumerated below . While at bats are used to calculate certain statistics , including batting average and slugging percentage , a player can qualify for the season-ending rankings in these categories only if they accumulate 502 plate appearances during the season .

  "/wiki/First_base": "First base , or 1B , is the first of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a baserunner to score a run for that player 's team . A first baseman is the player on the team playing defense who fields the area nearest first base , and is responsible for the majority of plays made at that base . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the first baseman is assigned the number 3 . Also called first sacker or cornerman , the first baseman is ideally a tall player who throws left-handed and possesses good flexibility and quick reflexes . Flexibility is needed because the first baseman receives throws from the other infielders , the catcher and the pitcher after they have fielded ground balls . In order for the runner to be called out , the first baseman must be able to stretch towards the throw and catch it before the runner reaches first base . First base is often referred to as the other hot corner - the hot corner being third base - and therefore , like the third baseman , he must have quick reflexes to field the hardest hit balls down the foul line , mainly by left-handed pull hitters and right-handed hitters hitting to the opposite field .

  "/wiki/Philadelphia_Athletics_(1890\u201391)": "The Philadelphia Athletics were a short-lived Major League Baseball franchise that existed for two seasons from 1890 to 1891 . Known alternatively as the Philadelphia Quakers , and sometimes informally as Buffinton 's Beauties , they played their first season in the newly created Players ' League ( PL ) of 1890 , and were managed by Jim Fogarty and Charlie Buffinton . After the demise of the PL following the 1890 season , the team switched to the American Association ( AA ) for the 1891 season , and were managed by Bill Sharsig and George Wood . For each season , the franchise used Forepaugh Park as their home field . Before the 1890 season , the PL was founded by the first organized professional sports union , the Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players , in an attempt to compete with the existing major leagues , the National League ( NL ) and the AA . Their intent was to break free from the standard business practices of the two leagues that they claimed stifled players ' salaries ; such as the reserve clause , and the Brush Classification System , as well as their ability to sell players to another team without the consent of the player . The Quakers were controlled by a group of investors , which included brothers G. W. and J. Earl Wagner . Under the pressure of PL investors , who were seeking recoupment of massive financial losses following the 1890 season , pressured the Brotherhood to compromise with the NL and AA . The deal called for the dissolution of the league , while allowing the players to return to their old teams without penalty , with the reserve clause and the selling of players , without their consent , outlawed . The Quakers were allowed entrance into the AA for 1891 season and claimed the nickname of the team they were replacing , the Philadelphia Athletics , who had been expelled for violating the league constitution . Although many players departed for new teams for the 1891 season , including Buffinton , Shindle , and Mike Griffin , they were able to sign suitable replacements , such as Gus Weyhing , Elton Chamberlain , and Pop Corkhill .

  "/wiki/Shutouts_in_baseball": "In Major League Baseball , a shutout ( denoted statistically as ShO or SHO ) refers to the act by which a single pitcher pitches a complete game and does not allow the opposing team to score a run . If two or more pitchers combine to complete this act , no pitcher is awarded a shutout , although the team itself can be said to have shut out the opposing team . The ultimate single achievement among pitchers is a perfect game , which has been accomplished 23 times in over 135 years , most recently by F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez of the Seattle Mariners on August 15 , 2012 . By definition , a perfect game is counted as a shutout . A no-hitter completed by one pitcher is also a shutout unless the opposing team manages to score through a series of errors , base on balls , catcher 's interferences , dropped third strikes , or hit batsmen . The all-time career leader in shutouts is Walter Johnson , who pitched for the Washington Senators from 1907-1927 . He accumulated 110 shutouts , which is 20 more than the second place leader , Pete Alexander . The most shutouts recorded in one season was 16 , which was a feat accomplished by both Pete Alexander ( 1916 ) and George Bradley ( 1876 ) . These records are considered among the most secure records in baseball , because pitchers today rarely earn more than one or two shutouts per season with a heavy emphasis on pitch count and relief pitching . Complete games themselves have also become rare among starting pitchers . The current leader among active players for career shutouts is Clayton Kershaw , who has thrown 15 .",

  "/wiki/Starting_pitcher": "In baseball ( hardball or softball ) , a starting pitcher or starter is the first pitcher in the game for each team . A pitcher is credited with a game started if they throw the first pitch to the opponent 's first batter of a game . Starting pitchers are expected to pitch for a significant portion of the game , although their ability to do this depends on many factors , including effectiveness , stamina , health , and strategy . A starting pitcher in professional baseball usually rests three , four , or five days after pitching a game before pitching another . Therefore , most professional baseball teams have four , five or six starting pitchers on their rosters . These pitchers , and the sequence in which they pitch , is known as the rotation . In modern baseball , a five-man rotation is most common . In contrast , a pitcher who enters the game after the first pitch of the game is a relief pitcher .

In each game , one pitcher on the winning team is awarded a win ( the winning pitcher ) and one pitcher on the losing team is given a loss ( the losing pitcher ) in their respective statistics . These pitchers are collectively known as the pitchers of record . The designation of win or loss for a pitcher is known as a decision , and only one pitcher for each team receives a decision . A starting pitcher who does not receive credit for a win or loss is said to have no decision . In certain situations , another pitcher on the winning team who pitched in relief of the winning pitcher can be credited with a save , and holds can be awarded to relief pitchers on both sides , but these are never awarded to the same pitcher who is awarded the win . The decisions are awarded by the official scorer of the game in accordance with the league 's rules . The official scorer does not assign a winning or losing pitcher in some games which are forfeited , such as those that are tied at the time of forfeiture . If the game is tied ( a rare event ) , no pitcher is awarded any decision .

The object of the game is for a team to score more runs than its opponent . The Official Baseball Rules hold that if the third out of an inning is a force out of a runner advancing to any base then , even if another baserunner crosses home plate before that force out is made , his run does not count . However , if the third out is not a force out , but a tag out , then if that other baserunner crosses home plate before that tag out is made , his run will count . In baseball statistics , a player who advances around all the bases to score is credited with a run ( R ) , sometimes referred to as a run scored . While runs scored is considered an important individual batting statistic , it is regarded as less significant than runs batted in ( RBIs ) . Both individual runs scored and runs batted in are heavily context-dependent ; however , the sabermetric statistic runs created provides a more sophisticated assessment of a player 's contribution toward producing runs for his team . A pitcher is likewise assessed runs surrendered in his statistics , which differentiate between standard earned runs ( for which the pitcher is statistically assigned full responsibility ) and unearned runs scored due to fielding errors , which do not count in his personal statistics . Specifically , if a fielding error occurs which affects the number of runs scored in an inning , the Official Scorer - the official in-game statistician - in order to determine how many of the runs should be classified as earned , will reconstruct the inning as if the error had not occurred . For example , with two outs , suppose a runner reaches base because of a fielding error , and then the next batter hits a two-run home run , and then the following batter then makes the third out , ending the inning . If the inning is reconstructed without the error , and if that third batter , instead of reaching on an error , registered an out , the inning would have ended there without any runs scoring .",
  "/wiki/Stolen_bases": "In baseball , a stolen base occurs when a runner advances to a base to which he is not entitled and the official scorer rules that the advance should be credited to the action of the runner . The umpires determine whether the runner is safe or out at the next base , but the official scorer rules on the question of credit or blame for the advance under Rule 10 . A stolen base most often occurs when a base runner advances to the next base while the pitcher is pitching the ball to home plate . Successful base stealers are not only fast but have good baserunning instincts and timing .",

  "/wiki/Third_baseman": "A third baseman , abbreviated 3B , is the player in baseball whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base - the third of four bases a baserunner must touch in succession to score a run . In the scoring system used to record defensive plays , the third baseman is assigned the number ' 5 ' . The third baseman requires good reflexes in reacting to batted balls , as he is often the closest infielder ( roughly 90-120 feet ) to the batter . The third base position requires a strong and accurate arm , as the third baseman often makes long throws to first base . The third baseman sometimes must throw quickly to second base in time to start a double play . The third baseman must also field fly balls in fair and foul territory . Third base is known as the hot corner , because the third baseman is relatively close to the batter and most right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball hard in this direction . A third baseman must possess good hand-eye coordination and quick reactions in order to catch hard line drives sometimes in excess of 125 miles per hour ( 201 km/h ) . Third basemen often must begin in a position even closer to the batter if a bunt is expected , creating a hazard if the ball is instead hit sharply . As with middle infielders , right-handed throwing players are standard at the position because they do not need to turn their body before throwing across the infield to first base . Mike Squires , who played fourteen games at third base in 1982 and 1983 , is a very rare example of a third baseman who threw lefty . Some third basemen have been converted from middle infielders or outfielders because the position does not require them to run as fast .",
  "/wiki/George_Keefe": "George Washington Keefe ( January 7 , 1867 in Washington , D.C. - August 24 , 1935 in Washington , D.C. ) was a left-handed professional baseball starting pitcher who played for the Washington Nationals , Buffalo Bisons and Washington Statesmen from 1886 to 1891 . Keefe made his major league debut on July 30 , 1886 at the age of 19 . The sixth youngest player in the league , he went 0-3 with a 5.17 ERA in four games in his first big league season . In 1887 , Keefe appeared in only one game . Despite allowing 16 hits , four walks and 20 runs ( only eight of which were earned ) , Keefe managed to complete ( and lose ) his only game of the season . He was also the sixth youngest player in 1887 . Keefe went 6-7 with a 2.84 ERA in 13 starts in 1888 . In 1889 , he went 8-18 with a 5.13 ERA , finishing fifth in the league in walks allowed ( 143 ) and seventh in losses . On May 1 , 1889 , Keefe set the National League record for most walks in an inning , when he walked seven batters in the fifth inning . The record was subsequently tied by Bob Ewing and Tony Mullane , and Dolly Gray walked eight batters in an inning in 1909 . Gray was an American League pitcher , however . Following the 1889 season , Keefe went to play for the Buffalo Bisons of the Players ' League .",

  "/wiki/Lewis_(baseball)": "Lewis ( First name unknown ) was a Major League Baseball player who played one game in 1890 with the Buffalo Bisons of the Players ' League . Lewis made his major league debut , and sole appearance , on July 12 , 1890 as the starting pitcher for the Bisons in a game against the Brooklyn Ward 's Wonders . Lewis gave up six runs in the first inning , six in the second , and eight in the third . After three innings , with Brooklyn leading , 20-4 , Buffalo 's manager Jack Rowe moved Lewis to left field , and called on left fielder Ed Beecher to pitch the final six innings . In Lewis 's three innings as a pitcher , he gave up 20 earned runs , 13 hits , and seven bases on balls . He also collected one hit in five at bats . Brooklyn won the game by a score of 28-16 . According to author Norman L. Macht , the Bisons had been having problems with various pitchers and arrived in Brooklyn on the 12th , when a local boy , whose last name was Lewis but whose first name remains mercifully unknown told manager Jack Rowe that he was a pitcher and asked for a tryout . Rowe started Lewis and kept him in the game for three innings , before pulling him in favor of Beecher , who gave up eight more runs . Neither Lewis nor Beecher pitched in another major league game . One newspaper account described Lewis 's try-out as a disastrous experiment and called the game one of the greatest slugging matches ever seen since curve pitching came into vogue . Sporting Life reported : The Buffalos tried a new pitcher named Lewis in the box , but after three innings he retired to left field , a much disgusted ball tosser .",
  "/wiki/Connie_Mack": "Cornelius McGillicuddy ( December 22 , 1862 - February 8 , 1956 ) , better known as Connie Mack , was an American professional baseball catcher , manager , and team owner . The longest-serving manager in Major League Baseball history , he holds records for wins ( 3,731 ) , losses ( 3,948 ) , and games managed ( 7,755 ) , with his victory total being almost 1,000 more than any other manager . Mack managed the Philadelphia Athletics for the club 's first 50 seasons of play , starting in 1901 , before retiring at age 87 following the 1950 season , and was at least part-owner from 1901 to 1954 . He was the first manager to win the World Series three times , and is the only manager to win consecutive Series on separate occasions ( 1910-11 , 1929-30 ) ; his five Series titles remain the third most by any manager , and his nine American League pennants rank second in league history . However , constant financial struggles forced repeated rebuilding of the roster , and Mack 's teams also finished in last place 17 times . Mack was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame at Cooperstown , New York in 1937 .",
  "/wiki/Catcher": "Catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player . When a batter takes his/her turn to hit , the catcher crouches behind home plate , in front of the ( home ) umpire , and receives the ball from the pitcher . In addition to this primary duty , the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well . The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket , but in cricket , wicketkeepers are increasingly known for their batting abilities . Positioned behind home plate , the catcher can see the whole field , and is therefore in the best position to direct and lead the other players in a defensive play . The catcher typically calls for pitches using hand signals . The calls are based on the pitcher 's mechanics and strengths , as well as the batter 's tendencies and weaknesses . Foul tips , bouncing balls in the dirt , and contact with runners during plays at the plate are all events to be handled by the catcher , necessitating the use of protective equipment . This includes a mask , chest and throat protectors , shin guards , and a heavily padded catcher 's mitt . Because the position requires a comprehensive understanding of the game 's strategies , the pool of former catchers yields a disproportionate number of managers in both Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball , including such prominent examples as Connie Mack , Steve O'Neill , Al L\u00f3pez , Mike Scioscia , and Joe Torre . The physical and mental demands of being involved on every defensive play can wear catchers down over a long season , and can have a negative effect on their offensive output . Because of the strategic defensive importance of catching , if a catcher has exceptional defensive skills , teams are often willing to overlook their relative offensive weaknesses ."
