It gained city status ( currently vested in the smaller City of Perth ) in 1856 and was promoted to the status of a Lord Mayorality in 1929 . The city inherited its name due to the influence of Sir George Murray , then Member of Parliament for Perthshire and Secretary of State for War and the Colonies .

During Australia 's involvement in World War II , Fremantle served as a base for submarines operating in the Pacific Theatre , and a US Navy Catalina flying boat fleet was based at Matilda Bay . An influx of immigrants after the war , predominantly from Britain , Italy , Greece , and Yugoslavia , led to rapid population growth .
