  "intro": "The 2010 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship was the 16th edition of the FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship. Like the previous tournament, the 2010 edition also was held in Japan, from 29 October to 14 November 2010, though the range of venues and locations was modified slightly (Matsumoto and Hamamatsu replaced Sapporo and Kobe in 2010). Twenty-four teams participated in the tournament. The tournament was won by Russia, who finished with a perfect record, defeating Brazil in the intense final game. Japan defeated the United States for the third place, winning their first bronze medal in the tournament history, and the first medal since 1978, having so far three gold and three silver already to their name. Russia won its second straight title, while Brazil was prevented from achieving a volleyball double of winning both the men's championship and the women's championship in the same year. Russia's towering outside hitter Yekaterina Gamova was named the tournament Most Valuable Player."
