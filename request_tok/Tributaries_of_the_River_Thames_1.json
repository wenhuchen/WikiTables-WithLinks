  "/wiki/Desborough_Cut": "The Desborough Cut is an artificial channel in the River Thames above Sunbury Lock near Walton on Thames in England . It was completed in 1935 , to improve flow and ease navigation on the river . The cut was dug between 1930 and 1935 , taking the river on a straight course between Weybridge and Walton , and avoiding a meandering stretch past Shepperton and Lower Halliford . It is a very slight curve 1,093 metres ( 1,195 yd ) long . Its geodesic length is 1,084 metres ( 1,185 yd ) as the crow flies , and its construction created Desborough Island . Two bridges were built across the cut to link to the island , which contains a water treatment works and a large extent of open space used for recreation . The cut alleviated flooding in Shepperton and halved the distance of travel on that part of the river . The cut creates a rare stretch on the Thames having alternative main navigation channels and is the longest such alternative . Navigation transit markers stand alongside it as a traditional method for powered boats to check their speed . The cut and the adjacent island were named after Lord Desborough who was chairman of the Thames Conservancy at the time and who opened it .",

Its offtake from the Thames is at the apex of Penton Hook , Staines upon Thames below its lower weir close to the Chertsey-Thorpe boundary in the Borough of Runnymede . Its outfall is the weir pool of Chertsey Lock back into the Thames , visible from Chertsey Bridge . The Environment Agency plans to build similar channels to the upstream Jubilee River , one of which will intersect the watercourse , another of which will be close to its outfall , thereby compensating for loss of its historic bypass functions .",

It faces the town of Chertsey and is the fifth-lowest of the forty-four locks along the non-tidal course of the river . Owing to a course alteration both banks at the site of the lock have been since medieval times in Surrey . Stone-built Chertsey Bridge built in 1785 is 210 m south ( downstream ) of the lock . The lock was built by the City of London Corporation in 1813 , lengthened in 1893 and again in 1913 .

It was constructed in the late 1990s and early 2000s to take overflow from the River Thames and so alleviate flooding to areas in and around the towns of Maidenhead , Windsor , and Eton in the counties of Berkshire and Buckinghamshire . It achieves this by taking water from the left ( at this point eastern ) bank of the Thames upstream of Boulter 's Lock near Maidenhead and returning it via the north bank downstream of Eton , Berkshire .

  "/wiki/Clewer_Mill_Stream": "Clewer Mill Stream is a narrow twisting backwater of the River Thames near Windsor , Berkshire , England , which leaves the main river at Bush Ait and rejoins just above Queen Elizabeth Bridge . It is about 1.5 miles long . Clewer Mill Stream is named after the watermill that it once drove . Clewer Mill Stream has provided food , power , fresh water , safe harbour and navigable access to the Thames for the small settlement of Clewer since the 10th century . In 1198 the Knights Templars of Bisham granted a fishery at Clewer to Richard de Sifrewast . The corn mill at Clewer was first mentioned in the Domesday Book with a value of 10 shillings and there has been a building on the site ever since . In 1781 the mill burnt down and its machinery , which had been visited by George III as it was so singular and curious , was destroyed . The mill was rebuilt after the fire , and although the water level was affected by the building of the weirs at Romney and Boveney Locks , Clewer Mill was operational until the late 19th century . In the 1920s Clewer Mill House was the home of a Mrs Moscockle who used to dress like Queen Mary and wave regally to pedestrians from her Rolls-Royce as she was driven around Windsor . Clewer Mill Stream was once a popular haunt of schoolboys from nearby Eton College although it was , along with the Thames itself , officially out-of-bounds and a punishment of 100 lines could be given by a sixth former to any lower boy ( roughly the first two years ) caught shooting [ water birds ] in the Clewer Stream . An account from the 1840s of life at Eton describes the thrill of sculling up the backwater to the mill and waiting until the miller was at dinner to carry one 's skiff around the mill wheel and launch it into the mill-stream where it was really dangerous , above the wheel . The 165-acre ( 0.67 km2 ) tract of land between Clewer Mill Stream and the main channel of the Thames is a meadow called The Rays which has been used for horse racing meetings since 1866 .",

Immediately above it is where the river is joined by the Loddon draining an area larger than central Berkshire . Immediately below and on the banks on this reach the keeping of extensive centuries-established flood meadows , once used more widely for pasture than today - more are used as gardens today in Berkshire than as farmland - means the extra flows are evened out so as not to cause flash flooding to Henley and all towns below . It is separated by a thin navigable channel used for mooring against the east ( Wargrave ) bank , and accessible by a footbridge , being part of the grounds of a private house . The ait is the largest example which is part of one owner 's garden below Oxford . The Ordnance Survey shows no name for the island .",

There is also evidence that the current course of the river to the confluence had been built by 1060 . However the Swift Ditch remained the faster route ( hence the name ) , and a pound lock was built at its head by the Oxford-Burcot Commission in 1624 .
