It has borders with the Black Sea to the southeast , Bulgaria to the south , Ukraine to the north , Hungary to the west , Serbia to the southwest , and Moldova to the east . It has a predominantly temperate-continental climate . With a total area of 238,397 square kilometers ( 92,046 square miles ) , Romania is the 8th largest country and also the 6th most populous member state of the European Union , having almost 20 million inhabitants . Its capital and largest city is Bucharest , and other major urban areas include Cluj-Napoca , Timi\u0219oara , Ia\u0219i , Constan\u021ba , Craiova , Bra\u0219ov , and Gala\u021bi . The River Danube , Europe 's second-longest river , rises in Germany 's Black Forest and flows in a general southeast direction for 2,857 km ( 1,775 mi ) , coursing through ten countries before emptying into Romania 's Danube Delta . The Carpathian Mountains , which cross Romania from the north to the southwest , include Moldoveanu Peak , at an altitude of 2,544 m ( 8,346 ft ) . Modern Romania was formed in 1859 through a personal union of the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia . The new state , officially named Romania since 1866 , gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877 . Following World War I after declaring its neutrality in 1914 , when Romania fought on the side of the Allied powers starting with 1916 , Bukovina , Bessarabia , Transylvania as well as parts of Banat , Cri\u0219ana , and Maramure\u0219 became part of the sovereign Kingdom of Romania . In June-August 1940 , as a consequence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and Second Vienna Award , Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union , and Northern Transylvania to Hungary . In November 1940 , Romania signed the Tripartite Pact and , consequently , in June 1941 entered World War II on the Axis side , fighting against the Soviet Union until August 1944 , when it joined the Allies and recovered Northern Transylvania .",
  "/wiki/Major_General": "Major general ( abbreviated MG , maj. gen. and similar ) is a military rank used in many countries . It is derived from the older rank of sergeant major general . The disappearance of the sergeant in the title explains the apparently confusing phenomenon whereby a lieutenant general outranks a major general while a major outranks a lieutenant . In the Commonwealth and the United States , it is a division commander 's rank subordinate to the rank of lieutenant general and senior to the ranks of brigadier and brigadier general . In the Commonwealth , major general is equivalent to the navy rank of rear admiral , and in air forces with a separate rank structure , it is equivalent to air vice-marshal . In some countries , including much of Eastern Europe , major general is the lowest of the general officer ranks , with no brigadier-grade rank .",

  "/wiki/Lieutenant_General": "Lieutenant general , lieutenant-general and similar ( abbrev Lt Gen , LTG and similar ) is a three-star military rank ( NATO code OF-8 ) used in many countries . The rank traces its origins to the Middle Ages , where the title of lieutenant general was held by the second in command on the battlefield , who was normally subordinate to a captain general . In modern armies , lieutenant general normally ranks immediately below general and above major general ; it is equivalent to the navy rank of vice admiral , and in air forces with a separate rank structure , it is equivalent to air marshal . A lieutenant general commands an army corps , made up of typically three army divisions , and consisting of around 60,000-70,000 soldiers ( U.S. ) . The seeming incongruity that a lieutenant general outranks a major general ( whereas a major outranks a lieutenant ) is due to the derivation of the former rank from sergeant major general , which was also subordinate to lieutenant general . In some countries ( e.g . France and Italy ) , the ranks of corps general or lieutenant colonel general are used instead of lieutenant general , in an attempt to solve this apparent anomaly - these ranks are often translated into English as lieutenant general . [ citation needed ] However , some countries of Latin America such as Brazil and Chile use divisional general as the equivalent of lieutenant general . In addition , because no brigadier general rank is used in Japan , lieutenant general is the rank of divisional commander . Therefore , it corresponds to divisional general of these countries . In a number of smaller states which employ NATO and western style military organizational structures , because of the limited number of soldiers in their armies , the rank of lieutenant general is the highest army rank in use . In Latvia , Lithuania and Singapore , the chief of defence is a lieutenant general , and in the Irish Defence Forces and Israel Defense Forces , the Chief of Staff holds this rank .",

The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force ( JMSDF ) was formed circa 1952-1954 after the dissolution of the IJN . The Imperial Japanese Navy was the third largest navy in the world by 1920 , behind the Royal Navy and the United States Navy ( USN ) . It was supported by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service for aircraft and airstrike operation from the fleet . It was the primary opponent of the Western Allies in the Pacific War . The origins of the Imperial Japanese Navy go back to early interactions with nations on the Asian continent , beginning in the early medieval period and reaching a peak of activity during the 16th and 17th centuries at a time of cultural exchange with European powers during the Age of Discovery . After two centuries of stagnation during the country 's ensuing seclusion policy under the sh\u014dgun of the Edo period , Japan 's navy was comparatively backward when the country was forced open to trade by American intervention in 1854 . This eventually led to the Meiji Restoration . Accompanying the re-ascendance of the Emperor came a period of frantic modernization and industrialization .

In some countries a brigadier general is informally designated as a one-star general ( OF-6 ) . In some countries , this rank is given the name of brigadier , which is usually equivalent to brigadier general in the armies of nations that use the rank . The rank can be traced back to the militaries of Europe where a brigadier general , or simply a brigadier , would command a brigade in the field . The rank name g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de brigade ( which translates as brigade general ) was first used in the French revolutionary armies . In the first quarter of the 20th century , British and Commonwealth armies used the rank of brigadier general as a temporary appointment , or as an honorary appointment on retirement ; in the 1920s this practice changed to the use of brigadier , which was not classed as a general officer . Some armies , such as Taiwan and Japan , use major general as the equivalent of brigadier general ( See also Japan & Taiwan for details. ) .

Mannerheim made a career in the Imperial Russian Army , rising to the rank of lieutenant general . He also had a prominent place in the ceremonies for Tsar Nicholas II 's coronation and later had several private meetings with the Tsar . After the Bolshevik revolution , Finland declared its independence but was soon embroiled in civil war between the pro-Bolshevik Reds and the Whites , who were the troops of the Senate of Finland , supported by troops of the German Empire . Mannerheim was appointed the military chief of the Whites . Twenty years later , when Finland was twice at war with the Soviet Union from November 1939 until September 1944 , Mannerheim successfully led the defence of Finland as commander-in-chief of the country 's armed forces . In 1944 , when the prospect of Germany 's defeat in World War II became clear , Mannerheim was elected President of Finland and oversaw peace negotiations with the Soviet Union and the UK . He resigned the presidency in 1946 and died in 1951 . In a Finnish survey 53 years after his death , Mannerheim was voted the greatest Finn of all time .

Baron Gustaf Mannerheim ( 1867-1951 ) served as Regent 1918-1919 and President of the Republic 1944-1946 . Lieutenant General Mannerheim had commanded the White Army in the Finnish Civil War in 1918 , and his promotion to field marshal had already been suggested in 1928 , the 10th anniversary of the end of the War . Back then the proposal was rejected as 'too warlike ' - and there was also fears that such promotion would prove politically controversial - but Mannerheim was nevertheless given an unofficial marshal 's baton by the Civil War 's White veterans . Five years later the political climate was more favourable , and the State Council decided to bestow Mannerheim the rank of field marshal . The decision was kept in secret , and came as a pleasant surprise to Mannerheim . He observed In a little ultrademocratic country it could seem quite pretentious to indulge in the luxury of a field marshal , but also admitted that it was not so frightful when the marshal costs the state nothing .
