  "/wiki/Tippecanoe_Battlefield_Park": "The Tippecanoe Battlefield Park preserves the location of the Battle of Tippecanoe fought on November 7 , 1811 . The 16-acre ( 6.5 ha ) site of the battle was deeded to the State of Indiana by John Tipton , a veteran of the fight , on November 7 , 1836 , the twenty-fifth anniversary of the battle . The site was used for a number of major political rallies during its earlier years , those most significant being on May 29 , 1840 in favor of William Henry Harrison 's bid for the White House attended by 30,000 people . The location was attracting visitors by the 1850s , and the battlefield was bordered by the Louisville , New Albany , & Salem Railroad during that decade . A refreshment stand was built adjacent to the site to accommodate visitors , and this land was later purchased by the Northwest Indiana Conference of the Methodist Church and used for the Battle Ground Collegiate Institute and later for a Methodist youth camp . Despite interest in the location for the sesquicentennial of the battle in 1961 , the camp was abandoned in 1971 and the location was neglected . It was designated a National Historical Landmark in 1960 . It is located in the Battle Ground Historic District . Local residents acquired the Methodist property upon its closure , and created a museum in the camp 's lodge . The citizen 's group merged with the Tippecanoe County Historical Association in 1990 which took over operation of the museum . The museum was extensively renovated in 1995 . The Battlefield Monument was ceded to the Tippecanoe County Park Board in 1972 .",
