  "/wiki/MP3": "MP3 ( formally MPEG-1 Audio Layer III or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III ) is a coding format for digital audio . Originally defined as the third audio format of the MPEG-1 standard , it was retained and further extended - defining additional bit-rates and support for more audio channels - as the third audio format of the subsequent MPEG-2 standard . A third version , known as MPEG 2.5 - extended to better support lower bit rates - is commonly implemented , but is not a recognized standard . MP3 ( or mp3 ) as a file format commonly designates files containing an elementary stream of MPEG-1 audio and video encoded data , without other complexities of the MP3 standard . In the aspects of MP3 pertaining to audio compression - the aspect of the standard most apparent to end-users ( and for which is it best known ) - MP3 uses lossy data-compression to encode data using inexact approximations and the partial discarding of data . This allows a large reduction in file sizes when compared to uncompressed audio . The combination of small size and acceptable fidelity led to a boom in the distribution of music over the Internet in the mid- to late-1990s , with MP3 serving as an enabling technology at a time when bandwidth and storage were still at a premium . The MP3 format soon became associated with controversies surrounding copyright infringement , music piracy , and the file ripping/sharing services MP3.com and Napster , among others . With the advent of portable media players , a product category also including smartphones , MP3 support remains near-universal . MP3 compression works by reducing ( or approximating ) the accuracy of certain components of sound that are considered ( by psychoacoustic analysis ) to be beyond the hearing capabilities of most humans . This method is commonly referred to as perceptual coding or as psychoacoustic modeling . The remaining audio information is then recorded in a space-efficient manner , using MDCT and FFT algorithms .",

  "/wiki/CD": "Compact disc ( CD ) is a digital optical disc data storage format that was co-developed by Philips and Sony and released in 1982 . The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings ( CD-DA ) but was later adapted for storage of data ( CD-ROM ) . Several other formats were further derived from these , including write-once audio and data storage ( CD-R ) , rewritable media ( CD-RW ) , Video Compact Disc ( VCD ) , Super Video Compact Disc ( SVCD ) , Photo CD , PictureCD , Compact Disc-Interactive ( CD-i ) , and Enhanced Music CD . The first commercially available audio CD player , the Sony CDP-101 , was released October 1982 in Japan . Standard CDs have a diameter of 120 millimetres ( 4.7 in ) and can hold up to about 80 minutes of uncompressed audio or about 700 MiB of data . The Mini CD has various diameters ranging from 60 to 80 millimetres ( 2.4 to 3.1 in ) ; they are sometimes used for CD singles , storing up to 24 minutes of audio , or delivering device drivers . At the time of the technology 's introduction in 1982 , a CD could store much more data than a personal computer hard drive , which would typically hold 10 MB . By 2010 , hard drives commonly offered as much storage space as a thousand CDs , while their prices had plummeted to commodity level . In 2004 , worldwide sales of audio CDs , CD-ROMs and CD-Rs reached about 30 billion discs . By 2007 , 200 billion CDs had been sold worldwide . From the early 2000s , CDs were increasingly being replaced by other forms of digital storage and distribution , with the result that by 2010 the number of audio CDs being sold in the U.S. had dropped about 50 percent from their peak ; however , they remained one of the primary distribution methods for the music industry . In 2014 , revenues from digital music services matched those from physical format sales for the first time .",

In addition to audio data , AIFF can include loop point data and the musical note of a sample , for use by hardware samplers and musical applications . The file extension for the standard AIFF format is .aiff or .aif .
