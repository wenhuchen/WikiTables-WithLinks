  "/wiki/Sultan": "Sultan ( /\u02c8s\u028clt\u0259n/ ; Arabic : \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 sul\u1e6d\u0101n , pronounced [ s\u028al\u02c8t\u02e4\u0251\u02d0n , sol\u02c8t\u02e4\u0251\u02d0n ] ) is a position with several historical meanings . Originally , it was an Arabic abstract noun meaning strength , authority , rulership , derived from the verbal noun \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0629 sul\u1e6dah , meaning authority or power ( cognate with the Hebrew word Shilton \u05e9\u05dc\u05d8\u05d5\u05df which retained that meaning to the present ) . Later , it came to be used as the title of certain rulers who claimed almost full sovereignty in practical terms ( i.e. , the lack of dependence on any higher ruler ) , albeit without claiming the overall caliphate , or to refer to a powerful governor of a province within the caliphate . The adjective form of the word is sultanic , and the dynasty and lands ruled by a sultan are referred to as a sultanate ( \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0646\u0629 sal\u1e6danah ) . The term is distinct from king ( \u0645\u0644\u0643 malik ) , despite both referring to a sovereign ruler . The use of sultan is restricted to Muslim countries , where the title carries religious significance , contrasting the more secular king , which is used in both Muslim and non-Muslim countries . In recent years , sultan has been gradually replaced by king by contemporary hereditary rulers who wish to emphasize their secular authority under the rule of law . A notable example is Morocco , whose monarch changed his title from sultan to king in 1957 .",
