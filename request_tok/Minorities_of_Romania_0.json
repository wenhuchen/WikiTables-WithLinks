  "/wiki/Hungarians_in_Romania": "The Hungarian minority of Romania ( Hungarian : rom\u00e1niai magyarok , Romanian : maghiarii din Rom\u00e2nia ) is the largest ethnic minority in Romania , consisting of 1,227,623 people and making up 6.1% of the total population , according to the 2011 census . Most ethnic Hungarians of Romania live in areas that were , before the 1920 Treaty of Trianon , parts of Hungary . Encompassed in a region known as Transylvania , the most prominent of these areas is known generally as Sz\u00e9kely Land ( \u021ainutul Secuiesc , Sz\u00e9kelyf\u00f6ld ) , where Hungarians comprise the majority of the population , comprising Harghita and Covasna counties and parts of Mure\u0219 county . Transylvania also includes the historic regions of Banat , Cri\u0219ana and Maramure\u0219 . There are forty-one counties of Romania ; Hungarians form a large majority of the population in the counties of Harghita ( 85.21% ) and Covasna ( 73.74% ) , and a large percentage in Mure\u0219 ( 38.09% ) , Satu Mare ( 34.65% ) , Bihor ( 25.27% ) , S\u0103laj ( 23.35% ) and Cluj ( 15.93% ) counties .",
  "/wiki/Sz\u00e9kelys": "The Sz\u00e9kelys ( Hungarian pronunciation : [ \u02c8se\u02d0k\u025bj ] ) , sometimes also referred to as Szeklers ( Hungarian : sz\u00e9kelyek , Romanian : Secui , German : Szekler , Latin : Siculi ) , are a subgroup of the Hungarian people living mostly in the Sz\u00e9kely Land in Romania . A significant population descending from the Sz\u00e9kelys of Bukovina lives in Tolna and Baranya counties in Hungary and in certain districts of Vojvodina , Serbia . In the Middle Ages , the Sz\u00e9kelys , along with the Transylvanian Saxons , played a key role in the defense of the Kingdom of Hungary against the Ottomans in their posture as guards of the eastern border . With the Treaty of Trianon of 1920 , Transylvania ( including the Sz\u00e9kely Land ) became part of Romania , and the Sz\u00e9kely population was a target of Romanianization efforts . In 1952 , during the Socialist Republic of Romania , the former province of Mure\u0219 , Romania ( with the highest concentration of Sz\u00e9kely population ) , was legally designated as the Hungarian Autonomous Region . It was superseded in 1960 by the Mure\u0219-Hungarian Autonomous Region , itself divided in 1968 into three non-autonomous counties , Harghita , Covasna and Mure\u0219 . In post-Cold War Romania , where the Sz\u00e9kelys form roughly half of the ethnic Hungarian population , members of the group have been among the most vocal of Hungarians seeking an autonomous Hungarian region in Transylvania . They were estimated to number about 860,000 in the 1970s and are officially recognized as a distinct minority group by the Romanian government . Today 's Sz\u00e9kely Land roughly corresponds to the Romanian counties of Harghita , Covasna and central and eastern Mure\u0219 . Based on the official 2011 Romanian census , 1,227,623 ethnic Hungarians live in Romania , mostly in the region of Transylvania , making 19.6% of the population of this region . Of these , 609,033 ( according to the 2011 Romanian Census ) live in the counties of Harghita , Covasna and Mure\u0219 , which taken together have a Hungarian majority ( 58% ) . The Hungarians in Sz\u00e9kely Land therefore account for half ( 49.41% ) of the Hungarians in Romania .",

They descend from an East Slavic population which inhabited the northern regions of the Eastern Carpathians from the Early Middle Ages . Together with other East Slavs from neighboring regions , they were often labeled [ by whom ? ] by the common exonym Ruthenians , or by the regionally more specific designation Carpathian Ruthenians , with sub-group designations such as Dolinyans , Boykos , Hutsuls and Lemkos . Unlike their neighbors to the east , who adopted the use of the ethnonym Ukrainians in the early 20th century , Rusyns kept and preserved their original name .

According to one estimate , Romanian citizens of Bulgarian origin number around 250,000 . Historically , Bulgarian communities in modern Romania have existed in Wallachia ( Bulgarian : \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0448\u043a\u043e , transliterated : Vlashko ) , Northern Dobruja ( Bulgarian : \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0414\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0443\u0434\u0436\u0430 , translit . Severna Dobrudzha ) and Transylvania ( Bulgarian : \u0421\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e , translit . Sedmigradsko ) . Currently , however , the Bulgarian community in present-day Romania that has retained most efficiently its numbers , social integrity and strong ethnic identity is that of the Banat Bulgarians , a Roman Catholic minority in the Banat who account for the bulk of the Bulgarian-identifying population of Romania . In Wallachia , they are only few Bulgarians who preserved their national identity , though the numbers of those who speak Bulgarian and affirm to have Bulgarian ancestors is still high . Much of the Torlak-speaking Roman Catholic Krashovani who today form a part of the Croatian minority in Romania had declared themselves Bulgarian during Austria-Hungary . The population of undisputed Bulgarian origin aside , Bulgarian researchers also claim that the Hungarian minority of the Sz\u00e9kely in central Romania is of Magyarized Bulgar ( Proto-Bulgarian ) origin and the \u015echei of Transylvania were Romanianized Bulgarians ( a view also supported by Lyubomir Miletich and accepted by Romanian writers ) .",

  "/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Romania": "The history of the Jews in Romania concerns the Jews both of Romania and of Romanian origins , from their first mention on what is present-day Romanian territory . Minimal until the 18th century , the size of the Jewish population increased after around 1850 , and more especially after the establishment of Greater Romania in the aftermath of World War I . A diverse community , albeit an overwhelmingly urban one , Jews were a target of religious persecution and racism in Romanian society - from the late-19th century debate over the Jewish Question and the Jewish residents ' right to citizenship , to the genocide carried out in the lands of Romania as part of the Holocaust . The latter , coupled with successive waves of aliyah , has accounted for a dramatic decrease in the overall size of Romania 's present-day Jewish community . Jewish communities existed in Romanian territory in the 2nd century AD . During the reign of Peter the Lame ( 1574-1579 ) the Jews of Moldavia , mainly traders from Poland who were competing with locals , were taxed and ultimately expelled . The authorities decided in 1650 and 1741 required Jews to wear clothing evidencing their status and ethnicity . The first blood accusation in Moldavia ( and , as such , in Romania ) was made in 1710 , when the Jews of T\u00e2rgu Neam\u021b were charged with having killed a Christian child for ritual purposes . An anti-Jewish riot occurred in Bucharest in the 1760s . During the Russo-Turkish War , 1768-1774 the Jews in the Danubian Principalities had to endure great hardships . Massacres and pillages were perpetrated in almost every town and village in the country . During the Greek War of Independence , which signalled the Wallachian uprising of 1821 , Jews were victims of pogroms and persecutions .",
