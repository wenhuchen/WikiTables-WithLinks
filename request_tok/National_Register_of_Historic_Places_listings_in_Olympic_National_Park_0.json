It is an open rectangular shelter built in 1935 by the Civilian Conservation Corps personnel from the Elwha River Camp in the National Park Service Rustic style . Located near the Elwha River , the peeled log structure is capped with a cedar shake roof , enclosing a cooking fireplace and chimney . It measures about 28 feet ( 8.5 m ) by 17 feet ( 5.2 m ) , with a stone cooking fireplace in the middle , rising through the roof . The lower portions of the log columns have been replaced with concrete piers due to deterioration , and the original peeled log railings have disappeared . The Altair and Elwha Campground Community Kitchens are the only such structures remaining in Olympic National Park . The Altair campground was named after the USS Altair , whose crew regularly used the site in the 1920s and 1930s . The kitchen structure was listed on National Register of Historic Places on July 13 , 2007 . By 2014 the Elwha Dam and all other dams along the Elwha River were removed .

  "/wiki/Elwha_River": "The Elwha River is a 45-mile ( 72 km ) river on the Olympic Peninsula in the U.S. state of Washington . From its source at Elwha snowfinger in the Olympic Mountains , it flows generally north to the Strait of Juan de Fuca . Most of the river 's course is within the Olympic National Park . The Elwha is one several rivers in the Pacific Northwest that hosts all five species of native Pacific salmon ( chinook , coho , chum , sockeye , and pink salmon ) , plus four anadromous trout species ( steelhead , coastal cutthroat trout , bull trout , and Dolly Varden char ) . From 1911 to 2014 , dams blocked fish passage on the lower Elwha River . Before the dams , 400,000 adult salmon returned yearly to spawn in 70 miles ( 110 km ) of river habitat . Prior to dam removal , fewer than 4,000 salmon returned each year in only 4.9 miles ( 7.9 km ) of habitat below the lower dam . The National Park Service removed the two dams as part of the $ 325 million Elwha Ecosystem Restoration Project . Dam removal work began in September 2011 and was completed in August 2014 . The river has already carried sediment to its mouth , creating 70 acres of estuary habitat at the Strait of Juan de Fuca . The first documented use of the name Elwha River dates to Henry Kellett 's 1846 map .",
