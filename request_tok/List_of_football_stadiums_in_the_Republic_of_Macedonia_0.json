It is the country 's political , cultural , economic , and academic centre . The territory of Skopje has been inhabited since at least 4000 BC ; remains of Neolithic settlements have been found within the old Kale Fortress that overlooks the modern city centre . Originally a Paeonian city , Scupi became the capital of Dardania in the second century BC . On the eve of the 1st century AD , the settlement was seized by the Romans and became a military camp . When the Roman Empire was divided into eastern and western halves in 395 AD , Scupi came under Byzantine rule from Constantinople . During much of the early medieval period , the town was contested between the Byzantines and the Bulgarian Empire , whose capital it was between 972 and 992 . From 1282 , the town was part of the Serbian Empire and acted as its capital city from 1346 to 1371 . In 1392 , Skopje was conquered by the Ottoman Turks who called it \u00dcsk\u00fcb , with this name also being in use in English for a time . The town stayed under Ottoman control for over 500 years , serving as the capital of pashasanjak of \u00dcsk\u00fcp and later the Vilayet of Kosovo .
