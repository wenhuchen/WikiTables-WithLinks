  "/wiki/Copper": "Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu ( from Latin : cuprum ) and atomic number 29 . It is a soft , malleable , and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity . A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish-orange color . Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity , as a building material , and as a constituent of various metal alloys , such as sterling silver used in jewelry , cupronickel used to make marine hardware and coins , and constantan used in strain gauges and thermocouples for temperature measurement . Copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form ( native metals ) . This led to very early human use in several regions , from c. 8000 BC . Thousands of years later , it was the first metal to be smelted from sulfide ores , c. 5000 BC , the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold , c. 4000 BC and the first metal to be purposefully alloyed with another metal , tin , to create bronze , c. 3500 BC . In the Roman era , copper was principally mined on Cyprus , the origin of the name of the metal , from aes \u0441yprium ( metal of Cyprus ) , later corrupted to \u0441uprum ( Latin ) , whence coper ( Old English ) and copper , first used around 1530 . Commonly encountered compounds are copper ( II ) salts , which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite , malachite , and turquoise , and have been used widely and historically as pigments . Copper used in buildings , usually for roofing , oxidizes to form a green verdigris ( or patina ) . Copper is sometimes used in decorative art , both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments . Copper compounds are used as bacteriostatic agents , fungicides , and wood preservatives .",
  "/wiki/Metric_ton": "The tonne ( /t\u028cn/ ( listen ) or /t\u0252n/ ; symbol : t ) , is a non-SI unit of mass equal to 1,000 kilograms . It is commonly referred to as a metric ton in the United States . It is equivalent to approximately 2,204.6 pounds , 1.102 short tons ( US ) or approximately 0.984 long tons ( UK ) . The official SI unit is the megagram ( Mg ) , a less common way to express the same mass . The tonne is derived from the mass of one cubic metre of pure water ; at 4 \u00b0C one thousand litres of pure water has an absolute mass of one tonne .",
  "/wiki/United_States_currency": "The United States dollar ( sign : $ ; code : USD ; also abbreviated US $ and referred to as the dollar , U.S. dollar , or American dollar ) is the official currency of the United States and its territories per the Coinage Act of 1792 . One dollar is divided into 100 cents ( Symbol : \u00a2 ) or 1000 mills ( for accounting purposes and for taxing . Symbol : \u20a5 ) . The Coinage Act of 1792 created a decimal currency by creating the following coins : tenth dollar , one-twentieth dollar , one-hundredth dollar . In addition the act created the dollar , half dollar , and quarter dollar coins . All of these coins are still minted in 2020 . In addition , several forms of paper money were introduced by Congress over the years . The latest of these , the Federal Reserve Note , was authorized by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , while all existing U.S. currency remains legal tender . Issuance of the previous form of the currency ( U.S. notes ) was discontinued in January 1971 . As a result , currently circulating paper money consists primarily of Federal Reserve Notes that are denominated in United States dollars ( 12 U.S.C . \u00a7 418 ) . Since the suspension in 1971 of convertibility of paper U.S. currency into any precious metal , the U.S. dollar is de facto fiat money .",

  "/wiki/Lead": "Lead ( /\u02c8l\u025bd/ ) is a chemical element with the symbol Pb ( from the Latin plumbum ) and atomic number 82 . It is a heavy metal that is denser than most common materials . Lead is soft and malleable , and also has a relatively low melting point . When freshly cut , lead is silvery with a hint of blue ; it tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air . Lead has the highest atomic number of any stable element and three of its isotopes are endpoints of major nuclear decay chains of heavier elements . Lead is a relatively unreactive post-transition metal . Its weak metallic character is illustrated by its amphoteric nature ; lead and lead oxides react with acids and bases , and it tends to form covalent bonds . Compounds of lead are usually found in the +2 oxidation state rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the carbon group . Exceptions are mostly limited to organolead compounds . Like the lighter members of the group , lead tends to bond with itself ; it can form chains and polyhedral structures . Lead is easily extracted from its ores ; prehistoric people in Western Asia knew of it . Galena , a principal ore of lead , often bears silver , interest in which helped initiate widespread extraction and use of lead in ancient Rome .",
  "/wiki/Zinc": "Zinc is a chemical element with the symbol Zn and atomic number 30 . Zinc is a slightly brittle metal at room temperature and has a blue-silvery appearance when oxidation is removed . It is the first element in group 12 of the periodic table . In some respects , zinc is chemically similar to magnesium : both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state ( +2 ) , and the Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions are of similar size . Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth 's crust and has five stable isotopes . The most common zinc ore is sphalerite ( zinc blende ) , a zinc sulfide mineral . The largest workable lodes are in Australia , Asia , and the United States . Zinc is refined by froth flotation of the ore , roasting , and final extraction using electricity ( electrowinning ) . Brass , an alloy of copper and zinc in various proportions , was used as early as the third millennium BC in the Aegean , Iraq , the United Arab Emirates , Kalmykia , Turkmenistan and Georgia , and the second millennium BC in West India , Uzbekistan , Iran , Syria , Iraq , and Israel/Palestine . Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India , though it was known to the ancient Romans and Greeks . The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC . To date , the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar , in Rajasthan , as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc .",
  "/wiki/Tin": "Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn ( from Latin : stannum ) and atomic number 50 . Tin is a silvery metal that characteristically has a faint yellow hue . Tin , like indium , is soft enough to be cut without much force . When a bar of tin is bent , the so-called tin cry can be heard as a result of sliding tin crystals reforming ; this trait is shared by indium , cadmium , and frozen mercury . Pure tin after solidifying keeps a mirror-like appearance similar to most metals . However , in most tin alloys ( such as pewter ) , the metal solidifies with a dull gray color . Tin is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table of elements . It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite , which contains stannic oxide , SnO2 . Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14 , germanium and lead , and has two main oxidation states , +2 and the slightly more stable +4 . Tin is the 49th most abundant element on Earth and has , with 10 stable isotopes , the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table , thanks to its magic number of protons . It has two main allotropes : at room temperature , the stable allotrope is \u03b2-tin , a silvery-white , malleable metal , but at low temperatures , it transforms into the less dense grey \u03b1-tin , which has the diamond cubic structure . Metallic tin does not easily oxidize in air .",
  "/wiki/Aluminium": "Aluminium ( aluminum in American and Canadian English ) is a chemical element with the symbol Al and atomic number 13 . It is a silvery-white , soft , non-magnetic and ductile metal in the boron group . By mass , aluminium makes up about 8% of the Earth 's crust , where it is the third most abundant element ( after oxygen and silicon ) and also the most abundant metal . Occurrence of aluminium decreases in the Earth 's mantle below , however . The chief ore of aluminium is bauxite . Aluminium metal is highly reactive , such that native specimens are rare and limited to extreme reducing environments . Instead , it is found combined in over 270 different minerals . Aluminium is remarkable for its low density and its ability to resist corrosion through the phenomenon of passivation . Aluminium and its alloys are vital to the aerospace industry and important in transportation and building industries , such as building facades and window frames . The oxides and sulfates are the most useful compounds of aluminium . Despite its prevalence in the environment , no known form of life uses aluminium salts metabolically , but aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals . Because of these salts ' abundance , the potential for a biological role for them is of continuing interest , and studies continue .",
  "/wiki/Aluminium_alloy": "Aluminium alloys ( or aluminum alloys ; see spelling differences ) are alloys in which aluminium ( Al ) is the predominant metal . The typical alloying elements are copper , magnesium , manganese , silicon , tin and zinc . There are two principal classifications , namely casting alloys and wrought alloys , both of which are further subdivided into the categories heat-treatable and non-heat-treatable . About 85% of aluminium is used for wrought products , for example rolled plate , foils and extrusions . Cast aluminium alloys yield cost-effective products due to the low melting point , although they generally have lower tensile strengths than wrought alloys . The most important cast aluminium alloy system is Al-Si , where the high levels of silicon ( 4.0-13% ) contribute to give good casting characteristics . Aluminium alloys are widely used in engineering structures and components where light weight or corrosion resistance is required . Alloys composed mostly of aluminium have been very important in aerospace manufacturing since the introduction of metal-skinned aircraft . Aluminium-magnesium alloys are both lighter than other aluminium alloys and much less flammable than alloys that contain a very high percentage of magnesium . Aluminium alloy surfaces will develop a white , protective layer of aluminium oxide if left unprotected by anodizing and/or correct painting procedures . In a wet environment , galvanic corrosion can occur when an aluminium alloy is placed in electrical contact with other metals with more positive corrosion potentials than aluminium , and an electrolyte is present that allows ion exchange . Referred to as dissimilar-metal corrosion , this process can occur as exfoliation or as intergranular corrosion .",
  "/wiki/Nickel": "Nickel is a chemical element with the symbol Ni and atomic number 28 . It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge . Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile . Pure nickel , powdered to maximize the reactive surface area , shows a significant chemical activity , but larger pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms on the surface and prevents further corrosion ( passivation ) . Even so , pure native nickel is found in Earth 's crust only in tiny amounts , usually in ultramafic rocks , and in the interiors of larger nickel-iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth 's atmosphere . Meteoric nickel is found in combination with iron , a reflection of the origin of those elements as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis . An iron-nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth 's outer and inner cores . Use of nickel ( as a natural meteoric nickel-iron alloy ) has been traced as far back as 3500 BCE . Nickel was first isolated and classified as a chemical element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt , who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral , in the cobalt mines of Los , H\u00e4lsingland , Sweden . The element 's name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology , Nickel ( similar to Old Nick ) , who personified the fact that copper-nickel ores resisted refinement into copper . An economically important source of nickel is the iron ore limonite , which often contains 1-2% nickel . Nickel 's other important ore minerals include pentlandite and a mixture of Ni-rich natural silicates known as garnierite .",
  "/wiki/Cobalt": "Cobalt is a chemical element with the symbol Co and atomic number 27 . Like nickel , cobalt is found in the Earth 's crust only in chemically combined form , save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron . The free element , produced by reductive smelting , is a hard , lustrous , silver-gray metal . Cobalt-based blue pigments ( cobalt blue ) have been used since ancient times for jewelry and paints , and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass , but the color was later thought to be due to the known metal bismuth . Miners had long used the name kobold ore ( German for goblin ore ) for some of the blue-pigment-producing minerals ; they were so named because they were poor in known metals , and gave poisonous arsenic-containing fumes when smelted . In 1735 , such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal ( the first discovered since ancient times ) , and this was ultimately named for the kobold . Today , some cobalt is produced specifically from one of a number of metallic-lustered ores , such as cobaltite ( CoAsS ) . The element is , however , more usually produced as a by-product of copper and nickel mining . The copper belt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) and Zambia yields most of the global cobalt production . World production in 2016 was 116,000 tonnes ( according to Natural Resources Canada ) , and the DRC alone accounted for more than 50% . Cobalt is primarily used in lithium-ion batteries , and in the manufacture of magnetic , wear-resistant and high-strength alloys . The compounds cobalt silicate and cobalt ( II ) aluminate ( CoAl2O4 , cobalt blue ) give a distinctive deep blue color to glass , ceramics , inks , paints and varnishes .",
  "/wiki/Molybdenum": "Molybdenum is a chemical element with the symbol Mo and atomic number 42 . The name is from Neo-Latin molybdaenum , from Ancient Greek \u039c\u03cc\u03bb\u03c5\u03b2\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 molybdos , meaning lead , since its ores were confused with lead ores . Molybdenum minerals have been known throughout history , but the element was discovered ( in the sense of differentiating it as a new entity from the mineral salts of other metals ) in 1778 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele . The metal was first isolated in 1781 by Peter Jacob Hjelm . Molybdenum does not occur naturally as a free metal on Earth ; it is found only in various oxidation states in minerals . The free element , a silvery metal with a gray cast , has the sixth-highest melting point of any element . It readily forms hard , stable carbides in alloys , and for this reason most of world production of the element ( about 80% ) is used in steel alloys , including high-strength alloys and superalloys . Most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water , but when molybdenum-bearing minerals contact oxygen and water , the resulting molybdate ion MoO2\u22124 is quite soluble . Industrially , molybdenum compounds ( about 14% of world production of the element ) are used in high-pressure and high-temperature applications as pigments and catalysts . Molybdenum-bearing enzymes are by far the most common bacterial catalysts for breaking the chemical bond in atmospheric molecular nitrogen in the process of biological nitrogen fixation . At least 50 molybdenum enzymes are now known in bacteria , plants , and animals , although only bacterial and cyanobacterial enzymes are involved in nitrogen fixation . These nitrogenases contain molybdenum in a form different from other molybdenum enzymes , which all contain fully oxidized molybdenum in a molybdenum cofactor .",
  "/wiki/Recycling": "Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects . It is an alternative to conventional waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions . Recycling can prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials , thereby reducing : energy usage , air pollution ( from incineration ) , and water pollution ( from landfilling ) . Recycling is a key component of modern waste reduction and is the third component of the Reduce , Reuse , and Recycle waste hierarchy . Thus , recycling aims at environmental sustainability by substituting raw material inputs into and redirecting waste outputs out of the economic system . There are some ISO standards related to recycling such as ISO 15270:2008 for plastics waste and ISO 14001:2015 for environmental management control of recycling practice . Recyclable materials include many kinds of glass , paper , cardboard , metal , plastic , tires , textiles , batteries , and electronics . The composting or other reuse of biodegradable waste - such as food or garden waste - is also a form of recycling . Materials to be recycled are either delivered to a household recycling center or picked up from curbside bins , then sorted , cleaned , and reprocessed into new materials destined for manufacturing new products . In the strictest sense , recycling of a material would produce a fresh supply of the same material - for example , used office paper would be converted into new office paper or used polystyrene foam into new polystyrene . This is accomplished when recycling certain types of materials , such as metal cans , which can become a can again and again , infinitely , without losing purity in the product . However , this is often difficult or too expensive ( compared with producing the same product from raw materials or other sources ) , so recycling of many products or materials involves their reuse in producing different materials ( for example , paperboard ) instead .",
  "/wiki/Steel": "Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon , and sometimes other elements . Because of its high tensile strength and low cost , it is a major component used in buildings , infrastructure , tools , ships , trains , automobiles , machines , appliances , and weapons . Iron is the base metal of steel . Iron is able to take on two crystalline forms ( allotropic forms ) , body centered cubic and face-centered cubic , depending on its temperature . In the body-centered cubic arrangement , there is an iron atom in the center and eight atoms at the vertices of each cubic unit cell ; in the face-centered cubic , there is one atom at the center of each of the six faces of the cubic unit cell and eight atoms at its vertices . It is the interaction of the allotropes of iron with the alloying elements , primarily carbon , that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties . In pure iron , the crystal structure has relatively little resistance to the iron atoms slipping past one another , and so pure iron is quite ductile , or soft and easily formed . In steel , small amounts of carbon , other elements , and inclusions within the iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations . The carbon in typical steel alloys may contribute up to 2.14% of its weight . Varying the amount of carbon and many other alloying elements , as well as controlling their chemical and physical makeup in the final steel ( either as solute elements , or as precipitated phases ) , slows the movement of those dislocations that make pure iron ductile , and thus controls and enhances its qualities . These qualities include the hardness , quenching behavior , need for annealing , tempering behavior , yield strength , and tensile strength of the resulting steel . The increase in steel 's strength compared to pure iron is possible only by reducing iron 's ductility ."
