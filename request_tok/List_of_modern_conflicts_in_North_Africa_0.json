It was carried out by Egyptians from different walks of life in the wake of the British-ordered exile of the revolutionary Egyptian Nationalist leader Saad Zaghlul , and other members of the Wafd Party in 1919 . The revolution led to Great Britain 's later recognition of Egyptian independence in 1922 as the Kingdom of Egypt , and the implementation of a new constitution in 1923 . Britain , however , refused to recognise full Egyptian sovereignty over Sudan , or to withdraw its forces from the Suez Canal Zone , factors that would continue to sour Anglo-Egyptian relations in the decades leading up to the Egyptian revolution of 1952 .",

  "/wiki/Rif_War": "The Rif War was an armed conflict fought from 1920 to 1927 between the colonial power Spain ( later joined by France ) and the Berber tribes of the Rif mountainous region of Morocco . Led by Abd el-Krim , the Riffians at first inflicted several defeats on the Spanish forces by using guerrilla tactics and captured European weapons . After France 's military intervention against Abd el-Krim 's forces and the major landing of Spanish troops at Al Hoceima , considered the first amphibious landing in history to involve the use of tanks and aircraft , Abd el-Krim surrendered to the French and was taken into exile . In 1909 , Rifian tribes aggressively confronted Spanish workers of the iron mines of the Rif , near Melilla , which led to the intervention of the Spanish Army . The military operations in Jebala , in the Moroccan West , began in 1911 with the Larache Landing . Spain worked to pacify a large part of the most violent areas until 1914 , a slow process of consolidation of frontiers that lasted until 1919 due to World War I . The following year , after the signing of the Treaty of Fez , the northern Moroccan area was adjudicated to Spain as a protectorate . The Riffian populations strongly resisted the Spanish , unleashing a conflict that would last for several years . In 1921 , the Spanish troops suffered the catastrophic Disaster of Annual in addition to a rebellion led by Rifian leader Abd el-Krim . As a result , the Spanish retreated to a few fortified positions while Abd el-Krim ultimately created an entire independent state : the Republic of the Rif . The development of the conflict and its end coincided with the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera , who took on command of the campaign from 1924 to 1927 . In addition , and after the Battle of Uarga in 1925 , the French intervened in the conflict and established a joint collaboration with Spain that culminated in the Alhucemas landing which proved a turning point .",
  "/wiki/Republic_of_the_Rif": "The Republic of the Rif ( Berber : Tagduda en Arrif ) , officially The Confederal Republic of the Tribes of the Rif , also recorded as the Riff , was a short-lived republic in northern Morocco that existed between 1921 and 1926 . It was created in September 1921 , when the people of the Rif revolted and declared their independence from Spanish occupation as well as from the Moroccan sultan Yusef . Today , the movement to establish a neo-Rif Republic still persists and is part of modern Moroccan republicanism .",
  "/wiki/Mediterranean,_Middle_East_and_African_theatres_of_World_War_II": "The Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre was a major theatre of operations during the Second World War . The vast size of the Mediterranean and Middle East theatre saw interconnected naval , land , and air campaigns fought for control of the Mediterranean , North Africa , the Horn of Africa , the Middle East and Southern Europe . The fighting in this theatre lasted from 10 June 1940 , when Italy entered the war on the side of Germany , until 2 May 1945 when all Axis forces in Italy surrendered . However , fighting would continue in Greece - where British troops had been dispatched to aid the Greek government - during the early stages of the Greek Civil War . The British referred to this theatre as the Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre ( so called due to the location of the fighting and the name of Middle East Command ) , the Americans called it the Mediterranean Theater of War and the German informal official history of the fighting is The Mediterranean , South-East Europe , and North Africa 1939-1941 ( 1995 ) . Regardless of the size of the theatre , the various campaigns were not seen as neatly separated areas of operations but part of a vast theatre of war . Fascist Italy aimed to carve out a new Roman Empire , while British forces aimed initially to retain the status quo . Italy invaded Greece , and not until the introduction of German forces were Greece and Yugoslavia overrun . Allied and Axis forces engaged in back and forth fighting across North Africa , with Axis interference in the Middle East causing fighting to spread there . With confidence high from early gains , German forces planned elaborate attacks to be launched to capture the Middle East and then to possibly attack the southern border of the Soviet Union . In three years of fighting , Axis forces were defeated in North Africa and their interference in the Middle East was halted . The anti-Axis coalition then commenced the Allied invasion of Italy , resulting in the Italians deposing Mussolini and joining the Allies .",

French rule in the region began in 1830 with the invasion of Algiers and lasted until the Algerian War of Independence concluded in 1962 . While the administration of Algeria changed significantly over the 132 years of French rule , the Mediterranean coastal region of Algeria , housing the vast majority of its population , was administered as an integral part of France from 1848 until independence . One of France 's longest-held overseas territories , Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of European immigrants known as colons and , later , as pieds-noirs . However , the indigenous Muslim population remained a majority of the territory 's population throughout its history . Gradually , dissatisfaction among the Muslim population with its lack of political and economic status fueled calls for greater political autonomy , and eventually independence from France . Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954 , when the first violent events began of what was later called the Algerian War , characterized by guerrilla warfare and illegal methods used by the French in order to put down the revolt . The war concluded in 1962 , when Algeria gained independence following the March 1962 Evian agreements and the July 1962 self-determination referendum . During its last years of existence , French Algeria was , as a part of France , a founding member state of the United Nations , NATO , and the European Economic Community ( later the European Union ) .",

Until the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936 , the Kingdom was only nominally independent , since the British retained control of foreign relations , communications , the military and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan . Between 1936 and 1952 , the British continued to maintain military presence and political advisers , at a reduced level . The legal status of Egypt had been highly convoluted , due to its de facto breakaway from the Ottoman Empire in 1805 , its occupation by Britain in 1882 , and its transformation into a sultanate and British protectorate in 1914 . In line with the change in status from sultanate to kingdom , the Sultan of Egypt , Fuad I , saw his title changed to King . The kingdom 's sovereignty was subject to severe limitations imposed by the British , who retained enormous control over Egyptian affairs , and whose military continued to occupy the country . Throughout the kingdom 's existence , the Sudan was formally united with Egypt . However , actual Egyptian authority in the Sudan was largely nominal due to Britain 's role as the dominant power in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan . During the reign of King Fuad , the monarchy struggled with the Wafd Party , a broadly based nationalist political organization strongly opposed to British domination , and with the British themselves , who were determined to maintain control over the Suez Canal . Other political forces emerging in this period included the Communist Party ( 1925 ) , and the Muslim Brotherhood ( 1928 ) , which eventually became a potent political and religious force . King Fuad died in 1936 and Farouk inherited the throne at the age of sixteen . Alarmed by the Kingdom of Italy 's recent invasion of Abyssinia , he signed the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty , requiring Britain to withdraw all troops from Egypt , except in the Suez Canal Zone ( agreed to be evacuated by 1949 ) .",

Italian Libya was formed from the Italian colonies of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania that were taken by the Kingdom of Italy from the Ottoman Empire in 1911 , during the Italo-Turkish War of 1911 to 1912 . The unified colony was established in 1934 by governor Italo Balbo , with Tripoli as the capital . The territory of the previous two colonies had already been referred to sometimes as Italian Libya or Italian North Africa ( Africa Settentrionale Italiana , or ASI ) , both names kept being used after the unification , with Italian Libya now being the official name of the newly combined colony . In 1923 , indigenous rebels associated with the Senussi Order organized the Libyan resistance movement against Italian settlement in Libya . The rebellion was totally put down by Italian forces in 1932 , after the so-called pacification campaign , which resulted in the deaths of a quarter of Cyrenaica 's population . During World War II , Italian Libya became the setting for the North African Campaign . Although the Italians were defeated there by the Allies in 1943 , many of the Italian settlers still remained in Libya . Under the terms of the 1947 peace treaty , Italy officially relinquished all claims to Libya , which was administrated by the United Kingdom and France until its independence in 1951 .",

In the decades leading up to the French incursion , Tunisia was a province of the declining Ottoman Empire that enjoyed a large measure of autonomy under the bey , Muhammad III as-Sadiq . In 1877 , Russia declared war on the Ottoman Empire . Its resulting victory in theRusso-Turkish War ( 1877-1878 ) triggered the dismemberment of large portions of Ottoman territory , including independence for several Balkan possessions and international discussions about the future of the North African provinces . The Berlin Congress of 1878 convened to resolve the Ottoman question . Britain , although opposed to total dismantling of the Ottoman Empire , offered France control of Tunisia , in return for Cyprus . Germany , seeing the French claim as a way to divert French attention from vengeful action in Europe after the Franco-Prussian War , and little concerned about the southern Mediterranean , agreed to allow France control of Tunisia . These discussions surrounding France 's role in Tunisia were kept secret from the Kingdom of Italy , which was deeply opposed to French intervention . The French presence in Tunisia came five decades after their occupation of neighboring Algeria , the time when the French were still inexperienced about and lacked the knowledge of how to develop a colony . Both of these countries had been possessions of the Ottoman Empire for three centuries , yet each had long ago attained political autonomy from the Sultan in Istanbul . Before the French arrived , Tunisia had begun a process of modern reforms , but financial difficulties mounted until the installation of a commission of European creditors . After their occupation , the French government assumed Tunisia 's international obligations .",
  "/wiki/1945_Tripoli_pogrom": "The 1945 Anti-Jewish riots in Tripolitania was the most violent rioting against Jews in North Africa in modern times . From November 5 to November 7 , 1945 , more than 140 Jews were killed and many more injured in a pogrom in British-military-controlled Tripolitania . 38 Jews were killed in Tripoli from where the riots spread . 40 were killed in Amrus , 34 in Zanzur , 7 in Tajura , 13 in Zawia and 3 in Qusabat . The British Military Administration was heavily criticized for acting too slowly to stop the rioting . Major-General Duncan Cumming , the British Chief Civil Affairs Officer , noted that Arab nationalism had been provoked by reports about Council of Foreign Ministers proposals to hand the country back to Italian tutelage or to some other country with suspected Colonial designs , and that It would seem that reports of the situation in Palestine and of anti-Jewish disturbances in Egypt finally touched off the pent-up excitement in the direction of the virtually defenceless Jews rather than against Italians . Hooliganism and fanaticism have played an important part in the disturbances together with a general tendency to loot . Official British reports highlight background factors responsible for the general tension at the time , such as economic hardship and the uncertain political future of Tripolitania . The neighbouring British province was expect to become the independent Cyrenaica Emirate , whilst contemporary post-war proposals for Tripolitania included a return to Italian rule and a trusteeship under the Soviet Union . As a result of the slow British response , a widely held belief amongst Libyan Jews is that the riots were instigated by the British in order to show that the Libyans could not rule themselves , or as some kind of warning to Libyan Zionists relating to the ongoing Jewish insurgency in Palestine . However , American diplomats believed that the British had been caught unaware and were sincere in their desire to curb [ the ] outbreaks promptly . State Department observer John E. Utter believed that blame for the initial troubles lay with both sides - Jews primed for provocative behavior by Zionist propaganda and Arabs stirred by anti-Jewish riots in Cairo .",

Tripolitania was a separate Italian colony from 1927 to 1934 . From 1934 to 1963 , Tripolitania was one of three administrative divisions within Italian Libya and the Kingdom of Libya , alongside Cyrenaica to the east and Fezzan to the south . The region had been settled since antiquity , first coming to prominence as part of the Carthaginian empire . Following the defeat of Carthage in the Punic Wars , Rome organized the region ( along with what is now modern day Tunisia ) , into a province known as Africa , and placed it under the administration of a proconsul . During the Diocletian reforms of the late 3rd century , all of North Africa was placed into the newly created Diocese of Africa , of which Tripolitania was a constituent province . After the Fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century , Tripolitania changed hands between the Vandals and the Byzantine Empire , until it was taken during the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in the 8th century . It was part of the region known to the Islamic world as Ifriqiya , whose boundaries roughly mirrored those of the old Roman province of Africa Proconsularis . Though nominally under the suzerainty of the Abbasid Caliphate , local dynasties such as the Aghlabids and later the Fatimid Caliphate were practically independent . The native Berbers , who had inhabited the area locally for centuries before the arrival of the Arabs , established their own native Hafsid dynasty over Ifriqiya in the 13th century , and would control the region until it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century , who established Ottoman Tripolitania as a distinct province .",

The revolution was initially aimed at overthrowing King Farouk . However , the movement had more political ambitions , and soon moved to abolish the constitutional monarchy and aristocracy of Egypt and Sudan , establish a republic , end the British occupation of the country , and secure the independence of Sudan ( previously governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium ) . The revolutionary government adopted a staunchly nationalist , anti-imperialist agenda , which came to be expressed chiefly through Arab nationalism , and international non-alignment . The revolution was faced with immediate threats from Western imperial powers , particularly the United Kingdom , which had occupied Egypt since 1882 , and France , both of whom were wary of rising nationalist sentiment in territories under their control throughout the Arab world , and Africa . The ongoing state of war with Israel also posed a serious challenge , as the Free Officers increased Egypt 's already strong support of the Palestinians . These two issues conflated four years after the revolution when Egypt was invaded by Britain , France , and Israel in the Suez Crisis of 1956 . Despite enormous military losses , the war was seen as a political victory for Egypt , especially as it left the Suez Canal in uncontested Egyptian control for the first time since 1875 , erasing what was seen as a mark of national humiliation . This strengthened the appeal of the revolution in other Arab and African countries . Wholesale agrarian reform , and huge industrialisation programmes were initiated in the first decade and half of the revolution , leading to an unprecedented period of infrastructure building , and urbanisation . By the 1960s , Arab socialism had become a dominant theme , transforming Egypt into a centrally planned economy . [ citation needed ] Official fear of a Western-sponsored counter-revolution , domestic religious extremism , potential communist infiltration , and the conflict with Israel were all cited as reasons compelling severe and longstanding restrictions on political opposition , and the prohibition of a multi-party system .",

Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip ( Palestine ) and Israel to the northeast , the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the east , Sudan to the south , and Libya to the west . Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt . Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",

Half a million people died over the 17 years of war , which may be divided into three stages : initial guerrilla war , Anyanya , and South Sudan Liberation Movement . However , the agreement that ended the First Sudanese Civil War 's fighting in 1972 failed to completely dispel the tensions that had originally caused it , leading to a reigniting of the north-south conflict during the Second Sudanese Civil War , which lasted from 1983 to 2005 .

Sudan 's predominant religion is Islam , and its official languages are Arabic and English . The capital is Khartoum , located at the confluence of the Blue and White Nile . Since 2011 , Sudan has been the scene of an ongoing military conflict in its southern states . Sudan 's history goes back to the Pharaonic period , witnessing the kingdom of Kerma ( c. 2500 BC-1500 BC ) , the subsequent rule of the Egyptian New Kingdom ( c. 1500 BC-1070 BC ) and the rise of the kingdom of Kush ( c. 785 BC-350 AD ) , which would in turn control Egypt itself for nearly a century . After the fall of Kush , the Nubians formed the three Christian kingdoms of Nobatia , Makuria and Alodia , with the latter two lasting until around 1500 .

An important decolonization war , it was a complex conflict characterized by guerrilla warfare , maquis fighting , and the use of torture . The conflict also became a civil war between the different communities and within the communities . The war took place mainly on the territory of Algeria , with repercussions in metropolitan France . Effectively started by members of the National Liberation Front ( FLN ) on 1 November 1954 , during the Toussaint Rouge ( Red All Saints ' Day ) , the conflict led to serious political crises in France , causing the fall of the Fourth French Republic ( 1946-58 ) replaced by the Fifth Republic with a strengthened Presidency . The brutality of the methods employed by the French forces failed to win hearts and minds in Algeria , alienated support in metropolitan France and discredited French prestige abroad . As the war dragged on , the French public slowly turned against it and many of France 's key allies , including the United States , switched from supporting France to abstaining in the UN debate on Algeria . After major demonstrations in Algiers and several other cities in favor of independence ( 1960 ) and a United Nations resolution recognizing the right to independence , Charles de Gaulle , the first President of the Fifth Republic , decided to open a series of negotiations with the FLN . These concluded with the signing of the \u00c9vian Accords in March 1962 . A referendum took place on 8 April 1962 and the French electorate approved the \u00c9vian Accords . The final result was 91% in favor of the ratification of this agreement and on 1 July , the Accords were subject to a second referendum in Algeria , where 99.72% voted for independence and just 0.28% against . The planned French withdrawal led to a state crisis .",

Since the foundation of the first Moroccan state by Idris I in 788 AD , the country has been ruled by a series of independent dynasties , reaching its zenith under Almoravid and Almohad rule , when it spanned parts of Iberia and northwestern Africa . The Marinid and Saadi dynasties resisted foreign domination into the 17th century , allowing Morocco to remain the only northwest African country to avoid Ottoman occupation . The Alaouite dynasty , which rules to this day , seized power in 1631 . The country 's strategic location near the mouth of the Mediterranean attracted the interest of Europe , and in 1912 , Morocco was divided into French and Spanish protectorates , with an international zone in Tangier . It regained its independence in 1956 , and has since remained comparatively stable and prosperous by regional standards , with the fifth largest economy in Africa .",

  "/wiki/Tuareg_Rebellion_(1962\u20131964)": "The Tuareg rebellion of 1962-1964 , sometimes called the First Tuareg Rebellion or the Alfellaga , was an insurgency by populations of what is now northern Mali begun shortly after the nation achieved independence from France in 1960 . This short revolt could only be repressed with the entry into the conflict of Morocco and Algeria in 1963 , which handed over the 35 leaders of the counter-rebellion , then imposed a military authority on the Tuareg regions . Many in the sparsely populated and ethnically distinct north of Mali along with some in southern Algeria and northern Niger expected an independent Tuareg , Berber , and Arab nation to be formed by the Sahara desert regions when French Colonialism ended . This combined with dissatisfaction over the new government led some Tuareg in Northern Mali to rebel in 1963 . The first Tuareg attacks began in northern Mali in early 1962 with small , hit and run raids against government targets . The attacks escalated in size and destructiveness through 1963 , resulting in very unsettled conditions in the Tuareg-populated north . However , the Tuareg attacks did not reflect a unified leadership , a well-coordinated strategy or clear evidence of a coherent strategic vision . The insurgents generally depended on their camels for transportation and were equipped mainly with unsophisticated and rather old small arms , unlike the Malian armies who owned Soviet weapons , and the support of Algeria and Morocco . They also failed to mobilize the Tuareg community as a whole . While estimates of their numbers are highly speculative , it is unlikely that rebel combatants ever numbered more than about 1,500 . Still , the government reacted quickly and harshly . Mali 's army , well-motivated and now well-equipped with new Soviet weapons , conducted vigorous counterinsurgency operations .",

The country 's economy centers on agriculture and mining . Some of Mali 's prominent natural resources include gold , being the third largest producer of gold in the African continent , and salt . Present-day Mali was once part of three West African empires that controlled trans-Saharan trade : the Ghana Empire ( for which Ghana is named ) , the Mali Empire ( for which Mali is named ) , and the Songhai Empire . During its golden age , there was a flourishing of mathematics , astronomy , literature , and art . At its peak in 1300 , the Mali Empire covered an area about twice the size of modern-day France and stretched to the west coast of Africa .

Many of the non-desert portions of the country are threatened by periodic drought and desertification . The economy is concentrated around subsistence , with some export agriculture in the more fertile south , and export of raw materials , especially uranium ore. Niger faces serious challenges to development due to its landlocked position , desert terrain , inefficient agriculture , high fertility rates without birth control , and the resulting overpopulation , the poor educational level and poverty of its people , lack of infrastructure , poor healthcare , and environmental degradation . Nigerien society reflects a diversity drawn from the long independent histories of its several ethnic groups and regions and their relatively short period living in a single state .

The conflict originated from an insurgency by the Polisario Front against Spanish colonial forces from 1973 to 1975 and the subsequent Western Sahara War against Morocco between 1975 and 1991 . Today the conflict is dominated by unarmed civil campaigns of the Polisario Front and their self-proclaimed SADR state to gain fully recognized independence for Western Sahara . The conflict escalated after the withdrawal of Spain from the Spanish Sahara in accordance with the Madrid Accords . Beginning in 1975 , the Polisario Front , backed and supported by Algeria , waged a 16-year-long war for independence against Mauritania and Morocco . In February 1976 , the Polisario Front declared the establishment of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic , which was not admitted into the United Nations , but won limited recognition by a number of other states . Following the annexation of Western Sahara by Morocco and Mauritania in 1976 , and the Polisario Front 's declaration of independence , the UN addressed the conflict via a resolution reaffirming the right to self-determination of the Sahrawi people . In 1977 , France intervened as the conflict reached its peak intensity . In 1979 , Mauritania withdrew from the conflict and territories , leading to a stalemate through most of the 1980s . After several more engagements between 1989 and 1991 , a cease-fire agreement was reached between the Polisario Front and the Moroccan government . At the time , most of the Western Sahara territory remained under Moroccan control , while the Polisario controlled some 20% of the territory in its capacity as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic , with additional pockets of control in the Sahrawi refugee camps along the Algerian border .

The conflict stemmed from a deterioration in relations that had occurred between the two countries after Egyptian President Anwar Sadat had rebuffed Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's entreaties to unify the two countries and had pursued a peace settlement with Israel in the aftermath of the Yom Kippur War of 1973 . Soon thereafter Libya began sponsoring dissidents and assassination plots to undermine Sadat , and Egypt responded in kind to weaken Gaddafi . In early 1976 Gaddafi dispatched troops to the Egyptian frontier where they began clashing with border guards . Sadat responded by moving many troops to the area , while the Egyptian General Staff drew up plans for an invasion to depose Gaddafi . Clashes along the border intensified in July 1977 . On 21 July a Libyan tank battalion raided the town of Sallum . The Egyptian forces ambushed it and subsequently launched a large counter-attack , conducting airstrikes against Gamal Abdel Nasser Airbase and sending a mechanised force 24 kilometres ( 15 mi ) into Libyan territory before withdrawing . Over the next two days heavy artillery fire was exchanged across the border , while Egyptian jets and commandos raided Libyan locales .

  "/wiki/Chadian\u2013Libyan_conflict": "The Chadian-Libyan conflict was a series of sporadic clashes in Chad between 1978 and 1987 between Libyan and Chadian forces . Libya had been involved in Chad 's internal affairs prior to 1978 and before Muammar Gaddafi 's rise to power in Libya in 1969 , beginning with the extension of the Chadian Civil War to northern Chad in 1968 . The conflict was marked by a series of four separate Libyan interventions in Chad , taking place in 1978 , 1979 , 1980-1981 and 1983-1987 . In all of these occasions Gaddafi had the support of a number of factions participating in the civil war , while Libya 's opponents found the support of the French government , which intervened militarily to save the Chadian government in 1978 , 1983 and 1986 . The pattern of the war delineated itself in 1978 , with the Libyans providing armour , artillery and air support and their Chadian allies the infantry , which assumed the bulk of the scouting and fighting . This pattern was radically changed in 1986 , towards the end of the war , when most Chadian forces united in opposing the Libyan occupation of northern Chad with a degree of unity that had never been seen before in Chad . This deprived the Libyan forces of their habitual infantry , exactly when they found themselves confronting a mobile army , well provided now by the United States , Zaire and France with anti-tank and anti-air missiles , thus cancelling the Libyan superiority in firepower . What followed was the Toyota War , in which the Libyan forces were routed and expelled from Chad , putting an end to the conflict . Gaddafi initially intended to annex the Aouzou Strip , the northernmost part of Chad , which he claimed as part of Libya on the grounds of an unratified treaty of the colonial period . In 1972 his goals became , in the evaluation of historian Mario Azevedo , the creation of a client state in Libya 's underbelly , an Islamic republic modelled after his jamahiriya , that would maintain close ties with Libya , and secure his control over the Aouzou Strip ; expulsion of the French from the region ; and use of Chad as a base to expand his influence in Central Africa .",

The GUNT replaced the fragile alliance led by F\u00e9lix Malloum and Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 , which collapsed in February 1979 . GUNT was characterized by intense rivalries that led to armed confrontations and the Libyan intervention in 1980 . Libya intervened in support of the GUNT 's President Goukouni Oueddei against the former GUNT Defence Minister Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 . Because of international pressures and uneasy relations between Goukouni and Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi , Goukouni asked the Libyans to leave Chad in November 1981 ; they were replaced by an Inter-African Force ( IAF ) . The IAF showed itself unwilling to confront Habr\u00e9 's militia , and on June 7 , 1982 , the GUNT was ousted by Habr\u00e9 ; Goukouni fled into exile . The GUNT , always under the leadership of Goukouni , became a coalition of the opposition groups aiming to overthrow Habr\u00e9 . Libya played once again a decisive role , providing massive support to Goukouni , and reducing the GUNT to the status of a Libyan proxy . A French intervention blocked GUNT from overthrowing Habr\u00e9 in 1983 and limited Libyan-GUNT control to Northern Chad . Internal dissensions and problems with Libyan patronage , including the arrest of Goukouni by the Libyans , caused the disintegration of the GUNT in 1986 .",

It lasted for 22 years and is one of the longest civil wars on record . The war resulted in the independence of South Sudan six years after the war ended . Roughly two million people died as a result of war , famine and disease caused by the conflict . Four million people in southern Sudan were displaced at least once ( and normally repeatedly ) during the war . The civilian death toll is one of the highest of any war since World War II and was marked by numerous human rights violations . These include slavery and mass killings ."
