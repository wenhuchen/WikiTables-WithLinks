Not at all coincidentally , Pope John XXII was a native of Cahors , and his father had been Sieur de Saint-F\u00e9lix en Quercy .

He was thus head of the Papal Secretariat , in charge of the drafting of papal bulls and letters , and a principal papal advisor . The post was also one of the most lucrative in the Roman Curia , since a fee was charged for every document and the Vice-Chancellor received a share of every fee .",
