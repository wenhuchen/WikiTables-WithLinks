  "/wiki/Sudden_infant_death_syndrome": "Sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS ) , also known as cot death or crib death , is the sudden unexplained death of a child of less than one year of age . Diagnosis requires that the death remain unexplained even after a thorough autopsy and detailed death scene investigation . SIDS usually occurs during sleep . Typically death occurs between the hours of 00:00 and 09:00 . There is usually no noise or evidence of struggle . The exact cause of SIDS is unknown . The requirement of a combination of factors including a specific underlying susceptibility , a specific time in development , and an environmental stressor has been proposed . These environmental stressors may include sleeping on the stomach or side , overheating , and exposure to tobacco smoke . Accidental suffocation from bed sharing ( also known as co-sleeping ) or soft objects may also play a role . Another risk factor is being born before 39 weeks of gestation . SIDS makes up about 80% of sudden and unexpected infant deaths ( SUIDs ) . The other 20% of cases are often caused by infections , genetic disorders , and heart problems .",

  "/wiki/Alice_Piper": "Alice Piper ( 7 June 1908 - 22 August 1985 ) was a Paiute ( N\u00fc\u00fcm\u00fc ) girl residing in Big Pine , California who petitioned to attend the newly built Big Pine High School in 1923 and was denied entry due to her race . At that time , California educational law prohibited Native American children from attending a public school if a separate government run Indian school was established within three miles of the public school . Alice Piper along with six other Indian children sued the district for the right to attend . Piper sued on the grounds that her 14th Amendment rights had been violated knowing full well that she was not receiving the same education that the newly built public school afforded . The local Indian day school only offered education up to the 5th grade level , was underfunded , and lacked many basic resources . Furthermore , the District trustees had previously agreed to allow Indian students to attend the school if their parents voted for a measure that would fund the construction of the school . Although the measure passed , the board of trustees did not honor their agreement . As a local resident recalled , It was an exciting morning when the request was made , all the mothers and fathers of children of school age , Indian and white , were on the street to hear the answer of the district trustees . When the request was denied , the Indians immediately took court action pressing their case in the name of Alice Piper , a beautiful , intelligent , Indian girl . The California Supreme Court unanimously ruled in her favor in the case Piper v. Big Pine ( 1924 ) , thus opening the door for herself and other Native American children to attend public schools in the state of California .",
