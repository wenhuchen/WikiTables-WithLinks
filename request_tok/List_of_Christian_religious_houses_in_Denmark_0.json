The \u00d8resund Bridge connects the two cities by rail and road . Originally a Viking fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now Gammel Strand , Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century . Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions , defences and armed forces . During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the Kalmar Union , governing the entire present day Nordic region in a personal union with Sweden and Norway ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state . The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of Scandinavia under the union for well over 120 years , starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion . After a plague outbreak and fire in the 18th century , the city underwent a period of redevelopment . This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts . After further disasters in the early 19th century when Horatio Nelson attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city , rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen 's architecture .",

These orders include the Order of Friars Minor , the Order of Saint Clare , and the Third Order of Saint Francis . They adhere to the teachings and spiritual disciplines of the founder and of his main associates and followers , such as Clare of Assisi , Anthony of Padua , and Elizabeth of Hungary , among many others . [ failed verification ] Francis began preaching around 1207 and traveled to Rome to seek approval from Pope Innocent III in 1209 to form a new religious order . The original Rule of Saint Francis approved by the Pope did not allow ownership of property , requiring members of the order to beg for food while preaching . The austerity was meant to emulate the life and ministry of Jesus Christ . Franciscans traveled and preached in the streets , while staying in church properties . Saint Clare , under Francis 's guidance , founded the Poor Clares ( Order of Saint Clare ) in 1212 , which remains a Second Order of the Franciscans . The extreme poverty required of members was relaxed in the final revision of the Rule in 1223 . The degree of observance required of members remained a major source of conflict within the order , resulting in numerous secessions . The Order of Friars Minor , previously known as the Observant branch , is one of the three Franciscan First Orders within the Catholic Church , the others being the Conventuals ( formed 1517 ) and Capuchins ( 1520 ) .

  "/wiki/Holy_Ghost": "For the majority of Christian denominations , the Holy Spirit , or Holy Ghost , is the third person of the Trinity : the Triune God manifested as God the Father , God the Son , and God the Holy Spirit ; each entity itself being God . Nontrinitarian Christians , who reject the doctrine of the Trinity , differ significantly from mainstream Christianity in their beliefs about the Holy Spirit . In Christian theology , pneumatology refers to the study of the Holy Spirit . Due to Christianity 's historical relationship with Judaism , theologians often identify the Holy Spirit with the concept of the Ruach Hakodesh in Jewish scripture , in the belief Jesus ( who was Jewish ) was expanding upon these Jewish concepts . Similar names , and ideas , include the Ruach Elohim ( Spirit of God ) , Ruach YHWH ( Spirit of Yahweh ) , and the Ruach Hakmah ( Spirit of Wisdom ) . In the New Testament it is identified with the Spirit of Christ , the Spirit of Truth , the Paraclete and the Holy Spirit . The New Testament details a close relationship between the Holy Spirit and Jesus during his earthly life and ministry . The Gospels of Matthew and Luke and the Nicene Creed state that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit , born of the Virgin Mary . The Holy Spirit descended on Jesus like a dove during his baptism , and in his Farewell Discourse after the Last Supper Jesus promised to send the Holy Spirit to his disciples after his departure . The Holy Spirit is referred to as the Lord , the Giver of Life in the Nicene Creed , which summarises several key beliefs held by many Christian denominations . The participation of the Holy Spirit in the tripartite nature of conversion is apparent in Jesus ' final post-resurrection instruction to his disciples at the end of the Gospel of Matthew ( 28:19 ) : make disciples of all the nations , baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , and For where two or three are gathered together in my name , there am I in the midst of them .

They are also known as Bernardines , after the highly influential Bernard of Clairvaux ( though that term is also used of one of the Franciscan Orders in Poland and Lithuania ) ; or as White Monks , in reference to the colour of the cuccula or white choir robe worn by the Cistercians over their habits , as opposed to the black cuccula worn by Benedictine monks . The term Cistercian ( French Cistercien ) , derives from Cistercium , the Latin name for the village of C\u00eeteaux , near Dijon in eastern France . It was in this village that a group of Benedictine monks from the monastery of Molesme founded C\u00eeteaux Abbey in 1098 , with the goal of following more closely the Rule of Saint Benedict . The best known of them were Robert of Molesme , Alberic of C\u00eeteaux and the English monk Stephen Harding , who were the first three abbots . Bernard of Clairvaux entered the monastery in the early 1110s with 30 companions and helped the rapid proliferation of the order . By the end of the 12th century , the order had spread throughout France and into England , Wales , Scotland , Ireland , Spain , Portugal , Italy , Scandinavia and Eastern Europe . The keynote of Cistercian life was a return to literal observance of the Rule of St Benedict . Rejecting the developments the Benedictines had undergone , the monks tried to replicate monastic life as it had been in Saint Benedict 's time ; indeed in various points they went beyond it in austerity . The most striking feature in the reform was the return to manual labour , especially agricultural work in the fields , a special characteristic of Cistercian life . The Cistercians also made major contributions to culture and technology in medieval Europe : Cistercian architecture is considered one of the most beautiful styles of medieval architecture ; and the Cistercians were the main force of technological diffusion in fields such as agriculture , hydraulic engineering , and metallurgy . The original emphasis of Cistercian life was on manual labour and self-sufficiency , and many abbeys have traditionally supported themselves through activities such as agriculture and brewing ales .",

  "/wiki/Lutheran": "Lutheranism is one of the largest branches of Protestantism that identifies with the teachings of Martin Luther , a 16th-century German reformer . Luther 's efforts to reform the theology and practice of the church launched the Protestant Reformation . The reaction of the government and church authorities to the international spread of his writings , beginning with the 95 Theses , divided Western Christianity . The split between the Lutherans and the Catholics was made public and clear with the 1521 Edict of Worms : the edicts of the Diet condemned Luther and officially banned citizens of the Holy Roman Empire from defending or propagating his ideas , subjecting advocates of Lutheranism to forfeiture of all property , half of the seized property to be forfeit to the imperial government and the remaining half forfeit to the party who brought the accusation . The divide centered primarily on two points : the proper source of authority in the church , often called the formal principle of the Reformation , and the doctrine of justification , often called the material principle of Lutheran theology . [ a ] Lutheranism advocates a doctrine of justification by grace alone through faith alone on the basis of Scripture alone , the doctrine that scripture is the final authority on all matters of faith . This is in contrast to the belief of the Roman Catholic Church , defined at the Council of Trent , concerning authority coming from both the Scriptures and Tradition . Unlike Calvinism , Lutherans retain many of the liturgical practices and sacramental teachings of the pre-Reformation Church , with a particular emphasis on the Eucharist , or Lord 's Supper . Lutheran theology differs from Reformed theology in Christology , divine grace , the purpose of God 's Law , the concept of perseverance of the saints , and predestination .",

It served as the Scandinavian headquarters of the Order , known also as the Hospitallers , and the prior of Antvorskov reported directly to the great officer of the Order in Germany , the Grand Master of the Order on Rhodes ( and , later , on Malta ) , and the pope . As a result , Antvorskov was one of the most important monastic houses in Denmark .

  "/wiki/Saint_John_the_Baptist": "John the Baptist [ note 1 ] ( late 1st century BC - 28-36 AD ) was a Jewish itinerant preacher in the early 1st century AD . Other titles for John include John the Forerunner in Eastern Christianity , John the Immerser in some Baptist traditions , and the prophet John ( Ya\u1e25y\u0101 ) in Islam . He is sometimes alternatively called John the Baptizer . John the Baptist is mentioned by the Hebrew historian Josephus and revered as a major religious figure in Christianity , Islam , the Bah\u00e1 ' \u00ed Faith , and Mandaeism . He is called a prophet by all of these faiths , and is honored as a saint in many Christian traditions . According to the New Testament , John anticipated a messianic figure greater than himself , and the Gospels portray John as the precursor or forerunner of Jesus , since John announces Jesus ' coming and prepares the people for Jesus ' ministry . Jesus himself identifies John as Elijah who is to come , which some biblical scholars interpret to mean that Jesus believed that John was the reincarnation of the Old Testament prophet Elijah , although John the Baptist in the Gospel of John explicitly denies being linked to Elijah ( John 1:21 ) . According to the New Testament , John the Baptist and Jesus of Nazareth were relatives . Some scholars maintain that John belonged to the Essenes , a semi-ascetic Judaic sect who expected a Hebrew messiah and who practiced ritual baptism . John used baptism as the central symbol or sacrament of his pre-messianic movement . Most scholars agree that John baptized Jesus , and several New Testament accounts report that some of Jesus ' early followers had previously been followers of John . According to the New Testament John was sentenced to death and subsequently beheaded by Herod Antipas sometime between 28 and 36 AD after John rebuked him for divorcing his wife , Phasaelis , and then unlawfully wedding Herodias , the wife of his brother Herod Philip I .",
  "/wiki/Knights_Hospitallers": "The Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem ( Latin : Ordo Fratrum Hospitalis Sancti Ioannis Hierosolymitani ) , commonly known as the Knights Hospitaller or the Order of Saint John , was a medieval and early modern Catholic military order . It was headquartered in the Kingdom of Jerusalem until 1291 , on the island of Rhodes from 1310 until 1522 , in Malta from 1530 until 1798 and at Saint Petersburg from 1799 until 1801 . Today several organizations continue the Hospitaller tradition , most importantly the Sovereign Military Order of Malta . The Hospitallers arose in the early 11th century , during the time of the Cluniac ( or Benedictine ) Reform , as a group of individuals associated with an Amalfitan hospital in the Muristan district of Jerusalem , dedicated to John the Baptist and founded around 1099 by Gerard Thom to provide care for sick , poor or injured pilgrims coming to the Holy Land . Some scholars , however , consider that the Amalfitan order and hospital were different from Gerard Thom 's order and its hospital . After the conquest of Jerusalem in 1099 during the First Crusade , the organisation became a military religious order under its own papal charter , charged with the care and defence of the Holy Land . Following the conquest of the Holy Land by Islamic forces , the knights operated from Rhodes , over which they were sovereign , and later from Malta , where they administered a vassal state under the Spanish viceroy of Sicily . The Hospitallers were one of the smallest groups to briefly colonise parts of the Americas : they acquired four Caribbean islands in the mid-17th century , which they turned over to France in the 1660s . The knights became divided during the Protestant Reformation , when rich commanderies of the order in northern Germany and the Netherlands became Protestant and largely separated from the Roman Catholic main stem , remaining separate to this day , although ecumenical relations between the descendant chivalric orders are amicable . The order was suppressed in England , Denmark , as well as in some other parts of northern Europe , and it was further damaged by Napoleon 's capture of Malta in 1798 , following which it became dispersed throughout Europe .",
  "/wiki/Asserbo_Charterhouse": "Asserbo Charterhouse is a fortress and Carthusian monastery ruin in the small town of Asserbo north of Frederiksv\u00e6rk on North Zealand in Denmark . The monastery was founded by Bishop Absalon in the later part of the 12th century and functioned as a short-lived Carthusian monastery . It later came under Sor\u00f8 Abbey and parts of it under Esrum Abbey and remained so until the end of the middle ages . In that period the buildings were used as a farmhouse or small manor and administered as a so-called Grangier ( farmhouse and nearby buildings ) by the monks of Sor\u00f8 Abbey . Originally it comprised a main building , a tower with a cellar , various cellars and some half-timbered houses . The buildings were founded on a structure of large bricks , known as monk bricks . The site was surrounded by an embankment and access was only possible by a drawbridge from the north side . In 1248 we know from written sources , that Asserbo Chartehouse had developed into a small village , the village now known as Asserbo . From the 15th century Asserbo charterhouse was leased to various noble families , until Steward of the Realm Poul Laxmand took ownership in 1490 . From then on , the ownership shifted between The Crown and various noble families until the start of the 18th century , when it was left to the devastating drifting sands of the time . The drifting sands and dunes were eventually stopped in the 1730s and covered by the plantation of Tisvilde Hegn ( English : Tisvilde Fence ) . The charterhouse was dug free in 1849 and the embankments were restored in 1972 .",
  "/wiki/Carthusian": "The Carthusian Order ( Latin : Ordo Cartusiensis ) , also called the Order of Saint Bruno , is a Catholic religious order of enclosed monastics . The order was founded by Bruno of Cologne in 1084 and includes both monks and nuns . The order has its own Rule , called the Statutes , rather than the Rule of Saint Benedict , and combines eremitical and cenobitic monasticism . The motto of the Carthusians is Stat crux dum volvitur orbis , Latin for The Cross is steady while the world is turning . The name Carthusian is derived from the Chartreuse Mountains in the French Alps : Saint Bruno built his first hermitage in a valley of these mountains . These names were adapted to the English charterhouse , meaning a Carthusian monastery . Today , there are 23 charterhouses , 18 for monks and 5 for nuns . The alcoholic cordial Chartreuse has been produced by the monks of Grande Chartreuse since 1737 , which gave rise to the name of the colour .",
