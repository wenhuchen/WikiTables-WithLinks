  "/wiki/Drop_tower": "A drop tower or big drop is a type of amusement ride incorporating a central structure or tower . Drop towers vary in height , passenger capacity , lift type , and brake type . Many are custom-made , although there are some mass-produced designs . Riders experience free-fall initially , followed by rapid heavy deceleration . With most drop towers , a gondola carrying riders is lifted to the top of a large vertical structure , then released to free-fall down the tower . Brakes activate to slow the gondola as it approaches the bottom of the ride . Some designs expand on this concept with features such as rotating gondolas , or several bounces before coming to rest . Most drop towers require child riders to exceed a minimum height ; limits vary widely depending upon the nature of the tower , with a 30-foot ( 9 m ) tower for smaller children from 37 inches ( 95 cm ) tall , and a 115-foot ( 35 m ) tower having a 51-inch ( 130 cm ) restriction . Drop towers use a magnetic braking system to slow the carriage quickly and smoothly once it reaches the bottom of the tower .

It inhabits a variety of mostly arid habitats like dry forests , scrub forests , and savannahs .

By 2016 , the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild . Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures . The cheetah was formally described by Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1775 and is the only extant member of the genus Acinonyx . Its yellowish tan or rufous to greyish white coat is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots . Its body is slender with a small rounded head , black tear-like streaks on the face , deep chest , long thin legs and long spotted tail . It reaches 70-90 cm ( 28-35 in ) at the shoulder , and weighs 21-72 kg ( 46-159 lb ) . The cheetah breeds throughout the year , and is an induced ovulator . Gestation lasts nearly three months , resulting in a litter of typically three to five , in rare cases up to eight cubs . They are weaned at the age of about six months .",

The park opened on February 8 , 2001 as Disney 's California Adventure Park or Disney 's California Adventure , and it is the second of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort complex , after Disneyland Park .

  "/wiki/3D_film": "A three-dimensional stereoscopic film ( also known as three-dimensional film , 3D film or S3D film ) is a motion picture that enhances the illusion of depth perception , hence adding a third dimension . The most common approach to the production of 3D films is derived from stereoscopic photography . In this approach , a regular motion picture camera system is used to record the images as seen from two perspectives ( or computer-generated imagery generates the two perspectives in post-production ) , and special projection hardware or eyewear is used to limit the visibility of each image to the viewer 's left or right eye only . 3D films are not limited to theatrical releases ; television broadcasts and direct-to-video films have also incorporated similar methods , especially since the advent of 3D television and Blu-ray 3D . 3D films have existed in some form since 1915 , but had been largely relegated to a niche in the motion picture industry because of the costly hardware and processes required to produce and display a 3D film , and the lack of a standardized format for all segments of the entertainment business . Nonetheless , 3D films were prominently featured in the 1950s in American cinema , and later experienced a worldwide resurgence in the 1980s and 1990s driven by IMAX high-end theaters and Disney-themed venues . 3D films became increasingly successful throughout the 2000s , peaking with the success of 3D presentations of Avatar in December 2009 , after which 3D films again decreased in popularity . Certain directors have also taken more experimental approaches to 3D filmmaking , most notably celebrated auteur Jean-Luc Godard in his films 3X3D and Goodbye to Language .",
