  "/wiki/Adverse_effect": "An adverse effect is an undesired harmful effect resulting from a medication or other intervention such as surgery . An adverse effect may be termed a side effect , when judged to be secondary to a main or therapeutic effect . If it results from an unsuitable or incorrect dosage or procedure , this is called a medical error and not a complication . Adverse effects are sometimes referred to as iatrogenic because they are generated by a physician/treatment . Some adverse effects occur only when starting , increasing or discontinuing a treatment . Using a drug or other medical intervention which is contraindicated may increase the risk of adverse effects . Adverse effects may cause complications of a disease or procedure and negatively affect its prognosis . They may also lead to non-compliance with a treatment regimen . Adverse effects of medical treatment resulted in 142,000 deaths in 2013 up from 94,000 deaths in 1990 globally . The harmful outcome is usually indicated by some result such as morbidity , mortality , alteration in body weight , levels of enzymes , loss of function , or as a pathological change detected at the microscopic , macroscopic or physiological level . It may also be indicated by symptoms reported by a patient . Adverse effects may cause a reversible or irreversible change , including an increase or decrease in the susceptibility of the individual to other chemicals , foods , or procedures , such as drug interactions .",
  "/wiki/Hypovolemia": "Hypovolemia , also known as volume depletion or volume contraction , is a state of decreased intravascular volume . This may be due to either a loss of both salt and water or a decrease in blood volume . Hypovolemia refers to the loss of extracellular fluid and should not be confused with dehydration . Dehydration refers to excessive total body water loss that results in cellular hypertonicity ( a relatively substantial loss of fluid within individual cells ) . Hypovolemia is caused by a variety of events , but these can be simplified into two categories : those that are associated with kidney function and those that are not . The signs and symptoms of hypovolemia worsen as the amount of fluid lost increases . Immediately or shortly after mild fluid loss , one may experience headache , fatigue , weakness , dizziness or thirst ( as in blood transfusion , diarrhea , vomiting ) . Untreated hypovolemia or excessive and rapid losses of volume may lead hypovolemic shock . Signs and symptoms of hypovolemic shock include increased heart rate , low blood pressure , pale or cold skin , and altered mental status . When these signs are seen , immediate action should be taken to restore the lost volume .",
  "/wiki/Loop_diuretic": "Loop diuretics are diuretics that act at the ascending limb of the loop of Henle in the kidney . They are primarily used in medicine to treat hypertension and edema often due to congestive heart failure or chronic kidney disease . While thiazide diuretics are more effective in patients with normal kidney function , loop diuretics are more effective in patients with impaired kidney function .",
  "/wiki/Thiazide": "Thiazide ( /\u02c8\u03b8a\u026a\u0259za\u026ad/ ) refers to both a class of sulfur-containing organic molecules and a class of diuretics based on the chemical structure of benzothiadiazine . The thiazide drug class was discovered and developed at Merck and Co. in the 1950s . The first approved drug of this class , chlorothiazide , was marketed under the trade name Diuril beginning in 1958 . In most countries , thiazides are the least expensive antihypertensive drugs available . Thiazide organic molecules are bi-cyclic structures that contain adjacent sulfur and nitrogen atoms on one ring . Confusion sometimes occurs because thiazide-like diuretics such as indapamide are referred to as thiazides . These molecules do not have the thiazide chemical structure . When used this way , thiazide refers to a drug which acts at the thiazide receptor . The thiazide receptor is a sodium-chloride transporter that pulls NaCl from the lumen in the distal convoluted tubule . Thiazide diuretics cause the body to release NaCl and water lumen , and increase the amount of urine made each day . An example of a molecule that is chemically a thiazide but is not used as a diuretic is methylchloroisothiazolinone . Methylchloroisothiazolinone is used as an antimicrobial in cosmetics .",
  "/wiki/Lassitude": "Fatigue is a subjective feeling of tiredness . It may be sudden or gradual in onset . It is a normal phenomenon if it follows prolonged physical or mental activity , and resolves completely with rest . It may be a symptom of one of many medical conditions if it prolonged , severe , progressive , or occurs without provocation . Physical fatigue is the transient inability of muscles to maintain optimal physical performance , and is made more severe by intense physical exercise . Mental fatigue is a transient decrease in maximal cognitive performance resulting from prolonged periods of cognitive activity . Mental fatigue can manifest as somnolence , lethargy , or directed attention fatigue . Fatigue and 'feelings of fatigue ' are sometimes confused . Unlike weakness , fatigue usually can be alleviated by periods of rest .",
  "/wiki/Thirst": "Thirst is the craving for potable fluids , resulting in the basic instinct of animals to drink . It is an essential mechanism involved in fluid balance . It arises from a lack of fluids or an increase in the concentration of certain osmolites , such as sodium . If the water volume of the body falls below a certain threshold or the osmolite concentration becomes too high , structures in the brain detect changes in blood constituents and signal thirst . Continuous dehydration can cause acute and chronic diseases , but is most often associated with renal and neurological disorders . Excessive thirst , called polydipsia , along with excessive urination , known as polyuria , may be an indication of diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus . There are receptors and other systems in the body that detect a decreased volume or an increased osmolite concentration . Some sources distinguish extracellular thirst from intracellular thirst , where extracellular thirst is thirst generated by decreased volume and intracellular thirst is thirst generated by increased osmolite concentration .",
  "/wiki/Muscle_cramps": "A cramp is a sudden , involuntary muscle contraction or overshortening ; while generally temporary and non-damaging , they can cause significant pain and a paralysis-like immobility of the affected muscle . Onset is usually sudden and it resolves on its own over a period of several seconds , minutes , or hours . Cramps may occur in a skeletal muscle or smooth muscle . Skeletal muscle cramps may be caused by muscle fatigue or a lack of electrolytes such as sodium ( a condition called hyponatremia ) , potassium ( called hypokalemia ) , or magnesium ( called magnesium deficiency ) . Cramps of smooth muscle may be due to menstruation or gastroenteritis .",
  "/wiki/Hypotension": "Hypotension is low blood pressure . Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps out blood . Blood pressure is indicated by two numbers , the systolic blood pressure ( the top number ) and the diastolic blood pressure ( the bottom number ) , which are the maximum and minimum blood pressures , respectively . A systolic blood pressure of less than 90 millimeters of mercury ( mm Hg ) or diastolic of less than 60 mm Hg is generally considered to be hypotension . Different numbers apply to children . However , in practice , blood pressure is considered too low only if noticeable symptoms are present . Hypotension is the opposite of hypertension , which is high blood pressure . It is best understood as a physiological state rather than a disease . Severely low blood pressure can deprive the brain and other vital organs of oxygen and nutrients , leading to a life-threatening condition called shock . Hypotension can be caused by low blood volume ( hypovolemia ) , hormonal changes , widening of blood vessels , anemia , heart problems , or endocrine problems . Some medications can also lead to hypotension . There are also syndromes that can cause hypotension in patients including orthostatic hypotension , vasovagal syncope , and other more rare conditions .",
  "/wiki/Hypokalemia": "Hypokalemia is a low level of potassium ( K+ ) in the blood serum . Mild low potassium does not typically cause symptoms . Symptoms may include feeling tired , leg cramps , weakness , and constipation . Low potassium also increases the risk of an abnormal heart rhythm , which is often too slow and can cause cardiac arrest . Causes of hypokalemia include vomiting , diarrhea , medications like furosemide and steroids , dialysis , diabetes insipidus , hyperaldosteronism , hypomagnesemia , and not enough intake in the diet . Normal potassium levels are between 3.5 and 5.0 mmol/L ( 3.5 and 5.0 mEq/L ) with levels below 3.5 mmol/L defined as hypokalemia . It is classified as severe when levels are less than 2.5 mmol/L . Low levels may also be suspected based on an electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . Hyperkalemia refers to a high level of potassium in the blood serum . The speed at which potassium should be replaced depends on whether or not there are symptoms or abnormalities on an electrocardiogram . Potassium levels that are only slightly below the normal range can be managed with changes in the diet . Lower levels of potassium require replacement with supplements either taken by mouth or given intravenously .",
  "/wiki/Acetazolamide": "Acetazolamide , sold under the trade name Diamox among others , is a medication used to treat glaucoma , epilepsy , altitude sickness , periodic paralysis , idiopathic intracranial hypertension ( raised brain pressure of unclear cause ) , and heart failure .

  "/wiki/Muscle_weakness": "Muscle weakness is a lack of muscle strength . The causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have either true or perceived muscle weakness . True muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases , including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy . It occurs in neuromuscular junction disorders , such as myasthenia gravis . Muscle weakness can also be caused by low levels of potassium and other electrolytes within muscle cells . It can be temporary or long-lasting ( from seconds or minutes to months or years ) . The term myasthenia is from my- from Greek \u03bc\u03c5\u03bf meaning muscle + -asthenia \u1f00\u03c3\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 meaning weakness .",
  "/wiki/Paralysis": "Paralysis is a loss of motor function in one or more muscles . Paralysis can be accompanied by a loss of feeling ( sensory loss ) in the affected area if there is sensory damage as well as motor . In the United States , roughly 1 in 50 people have been diagnosed with some form of permanent or transient paralysis . The word comes from the Greek \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03bb\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 , disabling of the nerves , itself from \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac ( para ) , beside , by and \u03bb\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 ( lysis ) , making loose . A paralysis accompanied by involuntary tremors is usually called palsy .",
  "/wiki/Heart_arrhythmia": "Arrhythmia , also known as cardiac arrhythmia or heart arrhythmia , is a group of conditions in which the heartbeat is irregular , too fast , or too slow . The heart rate that is too fast - above 100 beats per minute in adults - is called tachycardia , and a heart rate that is too slow - below 60 beats per minute - is called bradycardia . Some types of arrhythmias have no symptoms . Symptoms when present may include palpitations or feeling a pause between heartbeats . In more serious cases , there may be lightheadedness , passing out , shortness of breath or chest pain . While most types of arrhythmia are not serious , some predispose a person to complications such as stroke or heart failure . Others may result in sudden death . There are four main groups of arrhythmia : extra beats , supraventricular tachycardias , ventricular arrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias . Extra beats include premature atrial contractions , premature ventricular contractions and premature junctional contractions . Supraventricular tachycardias include atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia . Ventricular arrhythmias include ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia . Arrhythmias are due to problems with the electrical conduction system of the heart .",
  "/wiki/Hyperkalemia": "Hyperkalemia is an elevated level of potassium ( K+ ) in the blood . Normal potassium levels are between 3.5 and 5.0 mmol/L ( 3.5 and 5.0 mEq/L ) with levels above 5.5 mmol/L defined as hyperkalemia . Typically hyperkalemia does not cause symptoms . Occasionally when severe it can cause palpitations , muscle pain , muscle weakness , or numbness . Hyperkalemia can cause an abnormal heart rhythm which can result in cardiac arrest and death . Common causes of hyperkalemia include kidney failure , hypoaldosteronism , and rhabdomyolysis . A number of medications can also cause high blood potassium including spironolactone , NSAIDs , and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors . The severity is divided into mild ( 5.5-5.9 mmol/L ) , moderate ( 6.0-6.4 mmol/L ) , and severe ( > 6.5 mmol/L ) . High levels can be detected on an electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . Pseudohyperkalemia , due to breakdown of cells during or after taking the blood sample , should be ruled out . Initial treatment in those with ECG changes is calcium gluconate . Other medications used to rapidly reduce blood potassium levels include insulin with dextrose , salbutamol , and sodium bicarbonate .",

  "/wiki/Coma": "A coma is a deep state of prolonged unconsciousness in which a person can not be awakened ; fails to respond normally to painful stimuli , light , or sound ; lacks a normal wake-sleep cycle ; and does not initiate voluntary actions . Coma patients exhibit a complete absence of wakefulness and are unable to consciously feel , speak or move . Comas can be derived by natural causes , or can be medically induced . Clinically , a coma can be defined as the inability to consistently follow a one-step command . It can also be defined as a score of \u2264 8 on the Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) lasting \u2265 6 hours . For a patient to maintain consciousness , the components of wakefulness and awareness must be maintained . Wakefulness describes the quantitative degree of consciousness , whereas awareness relates to the qualitative aspects of the functions mediated by the cortex , including cognitive abilities such as attention , sensory perception , explicit memory , language , the execution of tasks , temporal and spatial orientation and reality judgment . From a neurological perspective , consciousness is maintained by the activation of the cerebral cortex - the gray matter that forms the outer layer of the brain and by the reticular activating system ( RAS ) , a structure located within the brainstem .",
  "/wiki/Metabolic_alkalosis": "Metabolic alkalosis is a metabolic condition in which the pH of tissue is elevated beyond the normal range ( 7.35-7.45 ) . This is the result of decreased hydrogen ion concentration , leading to increased bicarbonate , or alternatively a direct result of increased bicarbonate concentrations . The condition typically can not last long if the kidneys are functioning properly .",
  "/wiki/Metabolic_acidosis": "Metabolic acidosis is a serious electrolyte disorder characterized by an imbalance in the bodys acid-base balance . Metabolic acidosis has three main root causes : increased acid production , loss of bicarbonate , and a reduced ability of the kidneys to excrete excess acids . Metabolic acidosis can lead to acidemia , which is defined as an arterial blood pH lower than 7.37 , which itself is a result of acidosis - the process in the body that causes a low pH in blood and tissues . Acidemia and acidosis are not mutually exclusive - pH and hydrogen ion concentrations also depend on the coexistence of other acid-base disorders ; therefore , pH levels in people with metabolic acidosis can range from low , normal , to high . Metabolic acidosis can last minutes to several days ( acute metabolic acidosis ) , which often occurs during serious illnesses or hospitalizations , and is generally caused when the body produces an excess amount of organic acids ( ketoacids or lactic acid ) . Conversely , metabolic acidosis can last several weeks to years ( chronic metabolic acidosis ) , and is linked to impaired kidney function ( Chronic Kidney Disease ) and/or bicarbonate wasting . The adverse effects of acute versus chronic metabolic acidosis also differ , with acute metabolic acidosis impacting the cardiovascular system in hospital settings , and chronic metabolic acidosis affecting muscles , bones , kidney and cardiovascular health .",
  "/wiki/Kussmaul_respirations": "Kussmaul breathing is a deep and labored breathing pattern often associated with severe metabolic acidosis , particularly diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) but also kidney failure . It is a form of hyperventilation , which is any breathing pattern that reduces carbon dioxide in the blood due to increased rate or depth of respiration . In metabolic acidosis , breathing is first rapid and shallow but as acidosis worsens , breathing gradually becomes deep , labored and gasping . It is this latter type of breathing pattern that is referred to as Kussmaul breathing .",
  "/wiki/Neurological_symptoms": "A neurological disorder is any disorder of the nervous system . Structural , biochemical or electrical abnormalities in the brain , spinal cord or other nerves can result in a range of symptoms . Examples of symptoms include paralysis , muscle weakness , poor coordination , loss of sensation , seizures , confusion , pain and altered levels of consciousness . There are many recognized neurological disorders , some relatively common , but many rare . They may be assessed by neurological examination , and studied and treated within the specialities of neurology and clinical neuropsychology . Interventions for neurological disorders include preventive measures , lifestyle changes , physiotherapy or other therapy , neurorehabilitation , pain management , medication , operations performed by neurosurgeons or a specific diet . The World Health Organization estimated in 2006 that neurological disorders and their sequelae ( direct consequences ) affect as many as one billion people worldwide , and identified health inequalities and social stigma/discrimination as major factors contributing to the associated disability and suffering .",
  "/wiki/Lethargy": "Lethargy is a state of tiredness , weariness , fatigue , or lack of energy . It can be accompanied by depression , decreased motivation , or apathy . Lethargy can be a normal response to inadequate sleep , overexertion , overworking , stress , lack of exercise , improper nutrition , boredom , or a symptom of an illness or a disorder . It may also be a side-effect of medication or caused by an interaction between medications or medication ( s ) and alcohol . When part of a normal response , lethargy often resolves with rest , adequate sleep , decreased stress , physical exercise and good nutrition . Lethargy 's symptoms can last days or even months .",
  "/wiki/Seizures": "A seizure , formally known as an epileptic seizure , is a period of symptoms due to abnormally excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain . Outward effects vary from uncontrolled shaking movements involving much of the body with loss of consciousness ( tonic-clonic seizure ) , to shaking movements involving only part of the body with variable levels of consciousness ( focal seizure ) , to a subtle momentary loss of awareness ( absence seizure ) . Most of the time these episodes last less than 2 minutes and it takes some time to return to normal . Loss of bladder control may occur . Seizures may be provoked and unprovoked . Provoked seizures are due to a temporary event such as low blood sugar , alcohol withdrawal , low blood sodium , fever , brain infection , or concussion . Unprovoked seizures occur without a known or fixable cause such that ongoing seizures are likely . Unprovoked seizures may be triggered by stress or sleep deprivation . Diseases of the brain , where there has been at least one seizure and a long term risk of further seizures , are collectively known as epilepsy . Conditions that look like epileptic seizures but are not include fainting , nonepileptic psychogenic event , and tremor . A seizure that lasts for more than a brief period is a medical emergency . Any seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes should be treated as status epilepticus .",
  "/wiki/Stupor": "Stupor is the lack of critical mental function and a level of consciousness wherein an affected person is almost entirely unresponsive and only responds to intense stimuli such as pain . The word derives from the Latin stupor ( numbness , insensibility ) .",

The normal range is 2.1-2.6 mmol/L ( 8.8-10.7 mg/dL , 4.3-5.2 mEq/L ) , with levels greater than 2.6 mmol/L defined as hypercalcemia . Those with a mild increase that has developed slowly typically have no symptoms . In those with greater levels or rapid onset , symptoms may include abdominal pain , bone pain , confusion , depression , weakness , kidney stones or an abnormal heart rhythm including cardiac arrest . Most cases are due to primary hyperparathyroidism or cancer . Other causes include sarcoidosis , tuberculosis , Paget disease , multiple endocrine neoplasia ( MEN ) , vitamin D toxicity , familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia and certain medications such as lithium and hydrochlorothiazide . Diagnosis should generally include either a corrected calcium or ionized calcium level and be confirmed after a week . Specific changes , such as a shortened QT interval and prolonged PR interval , may be seen on an electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . Treatment may include intravenous fluids , furosemide , calcitonin or pamidronate in addition to treating the underlying cause . The evidence for furosemide use , however , is poor . In those with very high levels , hospitalization may be required . Haemodialysis may be used in those who do not respond to other treatments .",
  "/wiki/Gout": "Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent attacks of a red , tender , hot , and swollen joint . Pain typically comes on rapidly , reaching maximal intensity in less than 12 hours . The joint at the base of the big toe is affected in about half of cases . It may also result in tophi , kidney stones , or kidney damage . Gout is due to persistently elevated levels of uric acid in the blood . This occurs from a combination of diet , other health problems , and genetic factors . At high levels , uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints , tendons , and surrounding tissues , resulting in an attack of gout . Gout occurs more commonly in those who regularly eat meat or seafood , drink beer , or are overweight . Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by the presence of crystals in the joint fluid or in a deposit outside the joint . Blood uric acid levels may be normal during an attack . Treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , steroids , or colchicine improves symptoms . Once the acute attack subsides , levels of uric acid can be lowered via lifestyle changes and in those with frequent attacks , allopurinol or probenecid provides long-term prevention .",
  "/wiki/Calcification": "Calcification is the accumulation of calcium salts in a body tissue . It normally occurs in the formation of bone , but calcium can be deposited abnormally in soft tissue , causing it to harden . Calcifications may be classified on whether there is mineral balance or not , and the location of the calcification . Calcification may also refer to the processes of normal mineral deposition in biological systems , such as the formation of stromatolites or mollusc shells ( see Mineralization ( biology ) or Biomineralization ) .",

  "/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)": "Anorexia is a decreased appetite . While the term in non-scientific publications is often used interchangeably with anorexia nervosa , many possible causes exist for a decreased appetite , some of which may be harmless , while others indicate a serious clinical condition or pose a significant risk . Anorexia is a symptom , not a diagnosis . When a healthcare provider states that a patient has anorexia , they are simply referring to a decreased appetite . This means that the provider must find and treat the underlying cause of the anorexia . Anorexia is not to be confused with the mental health diagnosis , anorexia nervosa . Because the terms are commonly used interchangeably , a provider must clarify to a patient to which they are referring as to avoid confusion . Anyone can manifest with anorexia regardless of their gender , age , or weight . The term is from Ancient Greek \u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03be\u03af\u03b1 : '\u1f00\u03bd- ' without + '\u03cc\u03c1\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03c2 ' , spelled '\u00f3rexis ' meaning appetite .",

Nausea is a non-specific symptom , which means that it has many possible causes . Some common causes of nausea are gastroenteritis and other gastrointestinal disorders , food poisoning , motion sickness , dizziness , migraine , fainting and low blood sugar . Nausea is a side effect of many medications including chemotherapy , or morning sickness in early pregnancy . Nausea may also be caused by disgust and depression . Medications taken to prevent and treat nausea are called antiemetics . The most commonly prescribed antiemetics in the US are promethazine , metoclopramide and the newer , extremely effective ondansetron .

Vomiting can be caused by a wide variety of conditions ; it may be present as a specific response to ailments like gastritis or poisoning , or as a non-specific sequela ranging from brain tumors and elevated intracranial pressure to overexposure to ionizing radiation . The feeling that one is about to vomit is called nausea ; it often precedes , but does not always lead to vomiting . Antiemetics are sometimes necessary to suppress nausea and vomiting . In severe cases , where dehydration develops , intravenous fluid may be required . Self-induced vomiting can be a component of an eating disorder such as bulimia , and is itself now an eating disorder on its own , purging disorder . Vomiting is different from regurgitation , though the terms are often used interchangeably . Regurgitation is the return of undigested food back up the esophagus to the mouth , without the force and displeasure associated with vomiting . The causes of vomiting and regurgitation are generally different .",

  "/wiki/Hyperuricemia": "Hyperuricemia is an abnormally high level of uric acid in the blood . In the pH conditions of body fluid , uric acid exists largely as urate , the ion form . The amount of urate in the body depends on the balance between the amount of purines eaten in food , the amount of urate synthesised within the body ( e.g. , through cell turnover ) , and the amount of urate that is excreted in urine or through the gastrointestinal tract . In humans , the upper end of the normal range is 360 \u00b5mol/L ( 6 mg/dL ) for women and 400 \u00b5mol/L ( 6.8 mg/dL ) for men ."
