He is the CEO of Zayat Stables , LLC , a Thoroughbred horse racing business which bred and owns the 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah . Joe Drape of The New York Times described Zayat as controversial and one of the most successful and flamboyant owners in thoroughbred racing . Zayat was born in Cairo , Egypt to a wealthy family , and grew up in an ethnically-diverse neighborhood where he learned to ride horses . At age 18 , he moved to the United States where he attended college and ultimately obtained a master 's degree in business and public health from Boston University . After a brief career in commercial real estate in New York City , he returned to Egypt , and for about a decade ran the Al-Ahram Beverages Company , which he owned as part of an investment group . After the company was purchased by Heineken in 2002 , Zayat stayed on a few more years but also began investing in racehorses and established Zayat Stables in 2005 . Upon returning to the United States for good in 2007 , he made his racing stables his full-time occupation , working with his son , Justin , to build the business . While generally successful with his race horses , Zayat 's goal of winning the Kentucky Derby eluded him several times , including three second-place finishes , until his win with American Pharoah . He also filed bankruptcy proceedings in 2010 when a bank called a note due and tried to foreclose on his horses . Zayat Stables successfully completed its Chapter 11 reorganization , but Zayat was next plagued by legal issues related to his penchant for betting large sums of money on horse racing . Nonetheless , Zayat generated considerable positive publicity on social media for his efforts to save his racehorse Paynter from life-threatening health problems , a successful struggle that earned the colt the 2012 NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award .",
