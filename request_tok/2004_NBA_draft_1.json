Albanians form a significant minority at around 25% , followed by Turks , Romani , Serbs , Bosniaks , and Aromanians . The history of the region dates back to antiquity , beginning with the kingdom of Paeonia , presumably a mixed Thraco-Illyrian polity . In the late sixth century BC , the area was incorporated into the Persian Achaemenid Empire , then annexed by the kingdom of Macedonia in the fourth century BC . The Romans conquered the region in the second century BC and made it part of the much larger province of Macedonia . \u03a4he area remained part of the Byzantine Empire , but was often raided and settled by Slavic tribes beginning in the sixth century of the Christian era . Following centuries of contention between the Bulgarian , Byzantine , and Serbian Empire , it was part of the Ottoman dominion from the mid-14th until the early 20th century , when following the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913 , the modern territory of North Macedonia came under Serbian rule .",
