Born in Guildford , the third son of a British magistrate based in Hong Kong , Wodehouse spent happy teenage years at Dulwich College , to which he remained devoted all his life . After leaving school , he was employed by a bank but disliked the work and turned to writing in his spare time . His early novels were mostly school stories , but he later switched to comic fiction , creating several regular characters who became familiar to the public over the years . They include the jolly gentleman of leisure Bertie Wooster and his sagacious valet Jeeves ; the immaculate and loquacious Psmith ; Lord Emsworth and the Blandings Castle set ; the Oldest Member , with stories about golf ; and Mr. Mulliner , with tall tales on subjects ranging from bibulous bishops to megalomaniac movie moguls . Most of Wodehouse 's fiction is set in England , although he spent much of his life in the US and used New York and Hollywood as settings for some of his novels and short stories . He wrote a series of Broadway musical comedies during and after the First World War , together with Guy Bolton and Jerome Kern , that played an important part in the development of the American musical . He began the 1930s writing for MGM in Hollywood . In a 1931 interview , his na\u00efve revelations of incompetence and extravagance in the studios caused a furore . In the same decade , his literary career reached a new peak . In 1934 Wodehouse moved to France for tax reasons ; in 1940 he was taken prisoner at Le Touquet by the invading Germans and interned for nearly a year . After his release he made six broadcasts from German radio in Berlin to the US , which had not yet entered the war .",

The letters are introduced and annotated by Townend , who had provided Wodehouse with the story that inspired his character Ukridge . The letters were , in some cases , heavily revised by Wodehouse for the collection with the goal of making them more entertaining . The United States version of the book , titled Author ! Author ! , was published on 20 June 1962 by Simon & Schuster , Inc. , New York . It was substantially reworked , with commentary by Wodehouse replacing much of Townend 's contribution .",
