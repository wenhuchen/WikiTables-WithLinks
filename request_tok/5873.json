Some superheroes ( for example Batman ) derive their status from the technology they create and use , rather than from non-human or superhuman biology . While the Dictionary.com definition of superhero is a figure , especially in a comic strip or cartoon , endowed with superhuman powers and usually portrayed as fighting evil or crime , the longstanding Merriam-Webster dictionary gives the definition as a fictional hero having extraordinary or superhuman powers ; also : an exceptionally skillful or successful person . Terms such as masked crime fighters , costumed adventurers or masked vigilantes are sometimes used to refer to characters such as the Spirit , who may not be explicitly referred to as superheroes but nevertheless share similar traits . Some superheroes use their powers to help daily crime while also combating threats against humanity from supervillains , who are their criminal counterparts . Often at least one of these supervillains will be the superhero 's archenemy . Some long-running superheroes and superheroines such as Superman , Spider-Man , Orphen , Batman , Wonder Woman , the Hulk , Green Lantern , the Flash , Captain America , Thor , Wolverine , Iron Man and the X-Men have a rogues gallery of many villains .",
