  "/wiki/Gu\u00f0mundur_Kamban": "Gu\u00f0mundur Kamban ( 8 June 1888 - 5 May 1945 ) was an Icelandic playwright and novelist . He was born near Reykjav\u00edk , son of a merchant of an old and well-known Icelandic family . He graduated from the College of Reykjav\u00edk , where he received honoris causa in literature and language . While still at college , he was made assistant editor of the best known newspaper in Iceland , edited by Bj\u00f6rn J\u00f3nsson . In 1906 his psychic abilities were also investigated by the Experimental Society founded by Einar Hj\u00f6rleifsson Kvaran : as a clairvoyant , he succeeded in divining the contents of closed books , and as an automatic writer he penned works supposedly by Hans Christian Andersen , J\u00f3nas Hallgr\u00edmsson , and Snorri Sturluson . But he lost his mediumistic abilities after a serious illness . In 1908 he adopted the family name Kamban in place of his birth name ( Gu\u00f0mundur J\u00f3nsson ) and advocated a change in Icelandic naming conventions . In 1910 , he proceeded to the University of Copenhagen , where he specialized in literature and received his master 's degree . In 1914 he published his first play , Hadda Padda which was endorsed by Georg Brandes and shown in the Danish Royal Theatre with Kamban as assistant director . He later married an actress from the play , Agnete Egeberg , and they had a daughter in 1921 . In 1915 Kamban moved to New York , intending to establish himself as an English language writer . He was not successful and moved back to Copenhagen with his wife in 1917 .",

  "/wiki/Arne_Mattsson": "Arne Mattsson ( 2 December 1919 - 28 June 1995 ) was a Swedish film director , born in Uppsala . His early movies were mostly comedies . His biggest success was Hon dansade en sommar ( 1951 , aka . One Summer of Happiness ) , which earned him the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival and a nomination for the Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1952 . It caused some controversy at the time because it contained nudity . His 1953 film of Peder Sj\u00f6gren 's second novel , Bread of Love ( K\u00e4rlekens br\u00f6d ) , based on Sj\u00f6gren 's experiences as a volunteer in the Finnish Continuation War of 1941-44 angered the author , was banned in Finland and incurred the wrath of the Soviets at the Cannes Film Festival . In spite of all this , Sj\u00f6gren grudgingly admitted that as a study of men under severe pressure it was impressive . In 1958 he directed Damen i svart , the first in the series of five Hillman-thrillers , centred on Folke Mellvig 's crime-solving middle-class city couple Kajsa and John Hillman . The second in the series , Mannek\u00e4ng i r\u00f6tt ( 1958 ) , is considered by some to be a precursor of the Italian giallo films , notably Mario Bava 's Blood and Black Lace . The popularity of his mystery movies declined and in the 1970s and 1980s he made mostly low-budget thrillers - some in collaboration with Mats Helge Olsson - which got mostly bad reviews .",
