  "/wiki/Position_(team_sports)": "Position in team sports is the joint arrangement of a team on its field of play during a game and to the standardized place of any individual player in that arrangement . Much instruction , strategy , and reporting is organized by a set of individual player positions that is standard for the sport . In case of the striker position , the left striker can move freely around and be on the left or right of the other striker Some player positions may be official , others unofficial . For example , baseball rules govern the pitcher by that name , but not the shortstop , where pitcher and shortstop are two of baseball 's nine fielding positions .

  "/wiki/Goaltender": "In ice hockey , the goaltender or goalie is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team 's net , thus preventing the opposing team from scoring . The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the goal crease ( often referred to simply as the crease or the net ) . Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots . In today 's age of goaltending there are two common styles , butterfly and hybrid ( hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique ) . Because of the power of shots , the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact . The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice , as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game . One-on-one situations , such as breakaways and shootouts , have the tendency to highlight a goaltender 's pure skill , or lack thereof . No more than one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time . Teams are not required to use a goaltender and may instead opt to play with an additional skater , but the defensive disadvantage this poses generally means that the strategy is only used as a desperation maneuver when trailing late in a game or can be used if the opposing team has a delayed penalty ( if the team receiving the penalty touches the puck the play will stop ) . The goaltender is also known as the goalie , goaler , goalkeeper , net minder , and tender by those involved in the hockey community . In the early days of the sport , the term was spelled with a hyphen as goal-tender . The art of playing the position is called goaltending and there are coaches , usually called the goalie coach who specialize exclusively in working with goaltenders .",

The republic was governed by the Communist Party of Ukraine as a unitary one-party socialist soviet republic . The Ukrainian SSR was a founding member of the United Nations , although it was legally represented by the All-Union state in its affairs with countries outside of the Soviet Union . Upon the Soviet Union 's dissolution and perestroika , the Ukrainian SSR was transformed into the modern nation-state and renamed itself as Ukraine . Throughout its 72-year history , the republic 's borders changed many times , with a significant portion of what is now Western Ukraine being annexed by Soviet forces in 1939 from the Republic of Poland , and the addition of Zakarpattia in 1946 . From the start , the eastern city of Kharkiv served as the republic 's capital . However , in 1934 , the seat of government was subsequently moved to the city of Kiev , Ukraine 's historic capital . Kiev remained the capital for the rest of the Ukrainian SSR 's existence , and remained the capital of independent Ukraine after the breakup of the Soviet Union . Geographically , the Ukrainian SSR was situated in Eastern Europe to the north of the Black Sea , bordered by the Soviet republics of Moldavia , Byelorussia , and the Russian SFSR . The Ukrainian SSR 's border with Czechoslovakia formed the Soviet Union 's western-most border point . According to the Soviet Census of 1989 the republic had a population of 51,706,746 inhabitants , which fell sharply after the breakup of the Soviet Union . On 1 January 2018 , according to the State Statistics Committee of Ukraine the population of the country was 42,216,766 permanent residents .",

Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",

Generally , the forwards try to stay in three different lanes , also known as thirds , of the ice going from goal to goal . It is not mandatory , however , to stay in a lane . Staying in a lane aids in forming the common offensive strategy known as a triangle . One forward obtains the puck and then the forwards pass it between themselves making the goalie move side to side . This strategy opens up the net for scoring opportunities . This strategy allows for a constant flow of the play , attempting to maintain the control of play by one team in the offensive zone . The forwards can pass to the defence players playing at the blue line , thus freeing up the play and allowing either a shot from the point ( blue line position where the defence stands ) or a pass back to the offence . This then begins the triangle again . Each team has three forwards in each line :",
