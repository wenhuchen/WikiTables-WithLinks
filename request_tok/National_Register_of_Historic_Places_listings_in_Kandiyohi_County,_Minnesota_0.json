  "/wiki/Farmers'_Holiday_Association": "The Farmers ' Holiday Association was a movement of Midwestern United States farmers who , during the Great Depression , endorsed the withholding of farm products from the market , in essence creating a farmers ' holiday from work . The Farmers ' Holiday Association was organized in May 1932 by Milo Reno . The group urged farmers to declare a holiday from farming , with a slogan of Stay at Home-Buy Nothing-Sell Nothing and Lets call a Farmer 's Holiday , a Holiday let 's hold . We 'll eat our wheat and ham and eggs , And let them eat their gold . Farmers went to extreme measures to ensure that their wants were carried through . One person was killed when the farmers began to blockade roads , and other farmers rallied to destroy their crops , reducing supply , and raising prices . The highways into Sioux City and Council Bluffs , Iowa , were blocked by pickets who dumped farm produce on the side of the road . At Le Mars , Iowa some farmers dragged a judge out of his courtroom , placed a noose around his neck , and threatened to hang him unless he stopped approving farm foreclosures . The striking farmers were countered by sheriffs , militia , and vigilante groups . Farmers ' Holiday Association activity subsided by 1934 .",
  "/wiki/Great_Depression": "The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic depression that took place mostly during the 1930s , beginning in the United States . The timing of the Great Depression varied across nations ; in most countries , it started in 1929 and lasted until the late 1930s . It was the longest , deepest , and most widespread depression of the 20th century . The Great Depression is commonly used as an example of how intensely the world 's economy can decline . The Great Depression started in the United States after a major fall in stock prices that began around September 4 , 1929 , and became worldwide news with the stock market crash of October 29 , 1929 , ( known as Black Tuesday ) . Between 1929 and 1932 , worldwide gross domestic product ( GDP ) fell by an estimated 15% . By comparison , worldwide GDP fell by less than 1% from 2008 to 2009 during the Great Recession . Some economies started to recover by the mid-1930s . However , in many countries , the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the beginning of World War II . The Great Depression had devastating effects in countries both rich and poor . Personal income , tax revenue , profits and prices dropped , while international trade plunged by more than 50% . Unemployment in the U.S. rose to 25% and in some countries rose as high as 33% .",

  "/wiki/Swedish_American": "Swedish Americans ( Swedish : Svenskamerikaner ) are Americans of at least partial Swedish ancestry . They primarily include the 1.2 million Swedish immigrants during 1885-1915 and their descendants . They formed tight-knit communities , primarily in the American Midwest , and intermarried with other Swedish-Americans . Most were Lutheran Christians with origins in the state Church of Sweden who were affiliated with predecessor bodies of what are now the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America ( ELCA ) from the mergers of 1988 or the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod ( 1847 ) , or the recent North American Lutheran Church ( NALC ) of 2010 ; some were Methodists following Wesleyan doctrine . Today , Swedish Americans are found throughout the United States , with Minnesota , California and Illinois being the top three states with the highest number of Swedish Americans . Historically , newly arrived Swedish immigrants settled in the Midwest , namely Minnesota , the Dakotas and Wisconsin , just as other Scandinavian Americans .

  "/wiki/Dakota_War_of_1862": "The Dakota War of 1862 , also known as the Sioux Uprising , the Dakota Uprising , the Sioux Outbreak of 1862 , the Dakota Conflict , the U.S.-Dakota War of 1862 or Little Crow 's War , was an armed conflict between the United States and several bands of Dakota ( also known as the eastern 'Sioux ' ) . It began on August 17 , 1862 , along the Minnesota River in southwest Minnesota , four years after its admission as a state . Throughout the late 1850s in the lead-up to the war , treaty violations by the United States and late or unfair annuity payments by Indian agents caused increasing hunger and hardship among the Dakota . During the war , the Dakota made extensive attacks on hundreds of settlers and immigrants , which resulted in settler deaths , and caused many to flee the area . Intense desire for immediate revenge ended with soldiers capturing hundreds of Dakota men and interning their families . A military tribunal quickly tried the men , sentencing 303 to death for their crimes . President Lincoln would later commute the sentence of 264 of them . The mass hanging of 38 Dakota men was conducted on December 26 , 1862 , in Mankato , Minnesota ; it was the largest mass execution in United States history . Traders with the Dakota previously had demanded that the government give the annuity payments directly to them ( introducing the possibility of unfair dealing between the agents and the traders to the exclusion of the Dakota ) . In mid-1862 , the Dakota demanded the annuities directly from their agent , Thomas J. Galbraith . The traders refused to provide any more supplies on credit under those conditions , and negotiations reached an impasse . On August 17 , 1862 , one young Dakota with a hunting party of three others killed five settlers while on a hunting expedition .",

  "/wiki/Woodland_period": "In the classification of archaeological cultures of North America , the Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures spanned a period from roughly 1000 BCE to European contact in the eastern part of North America , with some archaeologists distinguishing the Mississippian period , from 1000 CE to European contact as a separate period . The term Woodland Period was introduced in the 1930s as a generic term for prehistoric sites falling between the Archaic hunter-gatherers and the agriculturalist Mississippian cultures . The Eastern Woodlands cultural region covers what is now eastern Canada south of the Subarctic region , the Eastern United States , along to the Gulf of Mexico . This period is variously considered a developmental stage , a time period , a suite of technological adaptations or traits , and a family tree of cultures related to earlier Archaic cultures . It can be characterized as a chronological and cultural manifestation without any massive changes in a short time but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools , leather crafting , textile manufacture , cultivation , and shelter construction . Many Woodland peoples used spears and atlatls until the end of the period , when they were replaced by bows and arrows ; however , Southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns . The most cited technological distinction of this period was the widespread use of pottery ( although pottery manufacture had arisen during the Archaic period in some places ) , and the diversification of pottery forms , decorations , and manufacturing practices . The increasing use of horticulture and the development of the Eastern Agricultural Complex , consisting of weedy seed plants as well as gourd cultivation , also meant that groups became less mobile over time and , in some times and places , people lived in permanently occupied villages and cities . Intensive agriculture characterizes the Mississippian period from c. 1000-1400 CE and may have continued up to European contact , around 500 years ago .",
  "/wiki/Plains_Village_period": "The Plains Village period or the Plains Village tradition is an archaeological period on the Great Plains from North Dakota down to Texas , spanning approximately 900/950 to 1780/1850 CE . On the west and east , Plains villagers were bounded by the Rocky Mountains and the Eastern Woodlands . Prior to the reintroduction of the horse and contact with Europeans and Africans , Plains Indians were mostly semi-sedentary ; they typically farmed in villages and hunted bison in temporary camps . Depending upon the region , their architecture included grass houses ; stone-lined , semi-subterranean pit-houses ; and earth lodges . Bison scapula hoes were important tools in farming crops such as maize , beans , and squash . People made ceramic pots for cooking and storage . The people of the earlier parts of this archaeological period spoke Siouan languages and Caddoan languages . They are of the Siouan-speaking Mandan and Hidatsa and the Caddoan-speaking Arikara , Pawnee , and Wichita peoples . During this time period , many more tribes from diverse language groups entered the Plains from the east and the west . Chronology of the early Great Plains includes these periods :",
  "/wiki/Oneota": "Oneota is a designation archaeologists use to refer to a cultural complex that existed in the eastern plains and Great Lakes area of what is now occupied by the United States from around AD 900 to around 1650 or 1700 . Based on classification defined in Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips ' 1958 book Method and Theory in American Archaeology , the Oneota culture belongs to formative stage . The culture is believed to have transitioned into various Siouan cultures of the protohistoric and historic times , such as the Ioway [ citation needed ] . A long-accepted ancestry to the Ho-chunk has yet to be conclusively demonstrated . Oneota is considered a major component of Upper Mississippian culture . It is characterized by globular , shell-tempered pottery that is often coarse in fibre . Pieces often had a spherical body , short necks and/or a flat lip . Sometimes the vessels had strap handles . Decoration includes wavy and zigzag lines , often in parallel . Most decoration was done on the top half of the vessel . Analytically , the culture has been broken down into various stages or horizons . Generally accepted are the following :",
  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",

Major federal programs and agencies included the Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) , the Civil Works Administration ( CWA ) , the Farm Security Administration ( FSA ) , the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 ( NIRA ) and the Social Security Administration ( SSA ) . They provided support for farmers , the unemployed , youth and the elderly . The New Deal included new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and efforts to re-inflate the economy after prices had fallen sharply . New Deal programs included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt . The programs focused on what historians refer to as the 3 Rs : relief for the unemployed and poor , recovery of the economy back to normal levels , and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression . The New Deal produced a political realignment , making the Democratic Party the majority ( as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 to 1969 ) with its base in liberal ideas , the South , traditional [ clarification needed ] Democrats , big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions and non-whites and ethnic whites . The Republicans were split , with conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as hostile to business and economic growth and liberals in support . The realignment crystallized into the New Deal coalition that dominated presidential elections into the 1960s while the opposing conservative coalition largely controlled Congress in domestic affairs from 1937 to 1964 .",
  "/wiki/National_Park_Service_rustic": "National Park Service rustic - sometimes colloquially called Parkitecture - is a style of architecture that developed in the early and middle 20th century in the United States National Park Service ( NPS ) through its efforts to create buildings that harmonized with the natural environment . Since its founding in 1916 , the NPS sought to design and build visitor facilities without visually interrupting the natural or historic surroundings . The early results were characterized by intensive use of hand labor and a rejection of the regularity and symmetry of the industrial world , reflecting connections with the Arts and Crafts movement and American Picturesque architecture . Architects , landscape architects and engineers combined native wood and stone with convincingly native styles to create visually appealing structures that seemed to fit naturally within the majestic landscapes . Examples of the style can be found in numerous types of National Park structures , including entrance gateways , hotels and lodges , park roads and bridges , visitor centers , trail shelters , informational kiosks , and even mundane maintenance and support facilities . Many of these buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places .",
