  "/wiki/Testudinidae": "Tortoises ( /\u02c8t\u0254\u02d0r.t\u0259s.\u026az/ ) are reptile species of the family Testudinidae of the order Testudines ( the turtles ) . They are particularly distinguished from other turtles by being land-dwelling , while many ( though not all ) other turtle species are at least partly aquatic . Like other turtles , tortoises have a shell to protect from predation and other threats . The shell in tortoises is generally hard , and like other members of the suborder Cryptodira , they retract their necks and heads directly backwards into the shell to protect them . Tortoises are unique among vertebrates in that the pectoral and pelvic girdles are inside the ribcage rather than outside . Tortoises can vary in dimension from a few centimeters to two meters . They are usually diurnal animals with tendencies to be crepuscular depending on the ambient temperatures . They are generally reclusive animals . Tortoises are the longest living land animal in the world , although the longest living species of tortoise is a matter of debate . Gal\u00e1pagos tortoises are noted to live over 150 years , but an Aldabra giant tortoise named Adwaita may have been the longest living at an estimated 255 years . In general , most tortoise species can live 80-150 years .",
  "/wiki/Geochelone_carbonaria": "The red-footed tortoise ( Chelonoidis carbonarius ) is a species of tortoise from northern South America . These medium-sized tortoises generally average 30 cm ( 12 in ) as adults , but can reach over 40 cm ( 16 in ) . They have dark-colored , loaf-shaped carapaces ( back shell ) with a lighter patch in the middle of each scute ( scales on the shell ) , and dark limbs with brightly colored scales that range from pale yellow to dark red . Recognized differences are seen between red-footed tortoises from different regions . They are closely related to the yellow-footed tortoise ( C. denticulata ) from the Amazon Basin . They are popularly kept as pets , and over-collection has caused them to be vulnerable to extinction . Their natural habitat ranges from savannah to forest edges around the Amazon Basin . They are omnivorous with a diet based on a wide assortment of plants , mostly fruit when available , but also including grasses , flowers , fungi , carrion , and invertebrates . They do not brumate , but may aestivate in hot , dry weather . Eggs , hatchlings , and juvenile tortoises are food for many predators , but the main threats for adults are jaguars and humans . Population density ranges from locally common to very scarce due in part to habitat destruction and over-collection for food and the pet trade .",
  "/wiki/Cheloniidae": "Cheloniidae is a family of typically large marine turtles that are characterised by their common traits such as , having a flat streamlined wide and rounded shell and almost paddle-like flippers for their forelimbs . The six species that make up this family are : the green sea turtle , loggerhead sea turtle , olive ridley sea turtle , hawksbill sea turtle , flatback sea turtle and the Kemp 's ridley sea turtle .",
  "/wiki/Caretta_caretta": "The loggerhead sea turtle ( Caretta caretta ) , also commonly called Caretta Caretta , is a species of oceanic turtle distributed throughout the world . It is a marine reptile , belonging to the family Cheloniidae . The average loggerhead measures around 90 cm ( 35 in ) in carapace length when fully grown . The adult loggerhead sea turtle weighs approximately 135 kg ( 298 lb ) , with the largest specimens weighing in at more than 450 kg ( 1,000 lb ) . The skin ranges from yellow to brown in color , and the shell is typically reddish brown . No external differences in sex are seen until the turtle becomes an adult , the most obvious difference being the adult males have thicker tails and shorter plastrons ( lower shells ) than the females . The loggerhead sea turtle is found in the Atlantic , Pacific , and Indian Oceans , as well as the Mediterranean Sea . It spends most of its life in saltwater and estuarine habitats , with females briefly coming ashore to lay eggs . The loggerhead sea turtle has a low reproductive rate ; females lay an average of four egg clutches and then become quiescent , producing no eggs for two to three years . The loggerhead reaches sexual maturity within 17-33 years and has a lifespan of 47-67 years . The loggerhead sea turtle is omnivorous , feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates . Its large and powerful jaws serve as an effective tool for dismantling its prey .",
  "/wiki/Chelonia_mydas": "The green sea turtle ( Chelonia mydas ) , also known as the green turtle , black ( sea ) turtle or Pacific green turtle , is a species of large sea turtle of the family Cheloniidae . It is the only species in the genus Chelonia . Its range extends throughout tropical and subtropical seas around the world , with two distinct populations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans , but it is also found in the Indian Ocean . The common name refers to the usually green fat found beneath its carapace , not to the color of its carapace , which is olive to black . This sea turtle 's dorsoventrally flattened body is covered by a large , teardrop-shaped carapace ; it has a pair of large , paddle-like flippers . It is usually lightly colored , although in the eastern Pacific populations parts of the carapace can be almost black . Unlike other members of its family , such as the hawksbill sea turtle , C. mydas is mostly herbivorous . The adults usually inhabit shallow lagoons , feeding mostly on various species of seagrasses . The turtles bite off the tips of the blades of seagrass , which keeps the grass healthy . Like other sea turtles , green sea turtles migrate long distances between feeding grounds and hatching beaches . Many islands worldwide are known as Turtle Island due to green sea turtles nesting on their beaches . Females crawl out on beaches , dig nests and lay eggs during the night .",
  "/wiki/Eretmochelys_imbricata": "The hawksbill sea turtle ( Eretmochelys imbricata ) is a Critically Endangered sea turtle belonging to the family Cheloniidae . It is the only extant species in the genus Eretmochelys . The species has a worldwide distribution , with Atlantic and Indo-Pacific subspecies - E. i. imbricata and E. i. bissa , respectively . The hawksbill 's appearance is similar to that of other marine turtles . In general , it has a flattened body shape , a protective carapace , and flipper-like limbs , adapted for swimming in the open ocean . E. imbricata is easily distinguished from other sea turtles by its sharp , curving beak with prominent tomium , and the saw-like appearance of its shell margins . Hawksbill shells slightly change colors , depending on water temperature . While this turtle lives part of its life in the open ocean , it spends more time in shallow lagoons and coral reefs . The World Conservation Union , primarily as a result of Human fishing practices , classifies E. imbricata as critically endangered . Hawksbill shells were the primary source of tortoiseshell material used for decorative purposes . The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species outlaws the capture and trade of hawksbill sea turtles and products derived from them .",
