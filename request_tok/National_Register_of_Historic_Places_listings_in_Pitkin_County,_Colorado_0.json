  "/wiki/Aspen,_Colorado": "Aspen is the home rule municipality that is the county seat and the most populous municipality of Pitkin County , Colorado , United States . Its population was 6,658 at the 2010 United States Census . Aspen is in a remote area of the Rocky Mountains ' Sawatch Range and Elk Mountains , along the Roaring Fork River at an elevation just below 8,000 feet ( 2,400 m ) above sea level on the Western Slope , 11 miles ( 18 km ) west of the Continental Divide . Founded as a mining camp during the Colorado Silver Boom and later named Aspen because of the abundance of aspen trees in the area , the city boomed during the 1880s , its first decade of existence . The boom ended when the Panic of 1893 led to a collapse in the silver market , and the city began a half-century known as the quiet years during which its population steadily declined , reaching a nadir of fewer than a thousand by 1930 . Aspen 's fortunes reversed in the mid-20th century when neighboring Aspen Mountain was developed into a ski resort , and industrialist Walter Paepcke bought many properties in the city in the 1950s and redeveloped them . Today it is home to three institutions , two of which Paepcke helped found , that have international importance : the Aspen Music Festival and School , the Aspen Institute , and the Aspen Center for Physics . In the late 20th century , the city became a popular retreat for celebrities . Gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson worked out of a downtown hotel and ran unsuccessfully for county sheriff . Singer John Denver wrote two songs about Aspen after settling there . Both of them popularized Aspen among the counter-cultural youth of the 1970s as an ideal place to live , and the city continued to grow even as it gained notoriety for some of the era 's hedonistic excesses ( particularly its drug culture ) .

It is a stone building erected in the late 19th century . In 1975 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places , the only house of worship in Pitkin County to be accorded that distinction . When built , it was originally the home of a Presbyterian congregation . Several decades later , when Aspen 's population had declined considerably from the era when the church was built , the church merged into a Methodist congregation in the city , part of an agreement by which a Methodist church elsewhere in Colorado became Presbyterian . The church building , restored in the early 21st century , is largely intact from its original construction . During the work , the largest organ on the Western Slope was installed .

  "/wiki/Presbyterian": "Presbyterianism is a part of the Reformed tradition within Protestantism , which traces its origins to Britain , particularly Scotland . Presbyterian churches derive their name from the presbyterian form of church government , which is governed by representative assemblies of elders . A great number of Reformed churches are organized this way , but the word Presbyterian , when capitalized , is often applied uniquely to churches that trace their roots to the Church of Scotland , as well as several English dissenter groups that formed during the English Civil War . Presbyterian theology typically emphasizes the sovereignty of God , the authority of the Scriptures , and the necessity of grace through faith in Christ . Presbyterian church government was ensured in Scotland by the Acts of Union in 1707 , which created the Kingdom of Great Britain . In fact , most Presbyterians found in England can trace a Scottish connection , and the Presbyterian denomination was also taken to North America , mostly by Scots and Scots-Irish immigrants . The Presbyterian denominations in Scotland hold to the Reformed theology of John Calvin and his immediate successors , although there is a range of theological views within contemporary Presbyterianism . Local congregations of churches which use presbyterian polity are governed by sessions made up of representatives of the congregation ( elders ) ; a conciliar approach which is found at other levels of decision-making ( presbytery , synod and general assembly ) . The roots of Presbyterianism lie in the Reformation of the 16th century , the example of John Calvin 's Republic of Geneva being particularly influential . Most Reformed churches that trace their history back to Scotland are either presbyterian or congregationalist in government . In the twentieth century , some Presbyterians played an important role in the ecumenical movement , including the World Council of Churches . Many Presbyterian denominations have found ways of working together with other Reformed denominations and Christians of other traditions , especially in the World Communion of Reformed Churches .",
  "/wiki/Methodist": "Methodism is an umbrella term used to describe denominations of Protestant Christianity which follow the line of the Methodist movement . Methodist denominations are historically related and derive their doctrine of practice and belief from the life and teachings of John Wesley . George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people .",

[ note 1 ] It was originally built with motors and other equipment left over from Aspen 's days as a silver mining center in the late 19th century . The development of the ski area that began with the lift began the revival of Aspen into the upscale resort town it has since become , which in turn helped establish downhill skiing as a major winter recreational activity in the Western United States after World War II . When the current structure was opened , Aspen claimed it was the longest ski lift in the world . It was closed in 1971 , but all its facilities remain on the mountain . It is one of the few remaining single-chair chairlifts in the United States . A small park and commemorative plaque have been established at the bottom station .

Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles . The style bears almost no relationship to the Queen Anne style architecture , a toned-down version of English Baroque mostly used for gentry houses , produced in the actual reign of Queen Anne from 1702 to 1714 . It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s .",

  "/wiki/Colorado_State_Highway_82": "State Highway 82 ( SH 82 ) is an 85.3-mile-long ( 137.3 km ) state highway in the U.S. state of Colorado . Its western half provides the principal transportation artery of the Roaring Fork Valley on the Colorado Western Slope , beginning at Interstate 70 ( I-70 ) and U.S. Highway 6 ( US 6 ) in Glenwood Springs southeast past Carbondale , Basalt and Aspen . From there it continues up the valley to cross the Continental Divide at Independence Pass . On the Eastern Slope , it follows Lake Creek past some of Colorado 's highest mountains to Twin Lakes Reservoir , where it ends at US 24 south of Leadville . At 12,095 feet ( 3,687 m ) above sea level , the traverse of Independence Pass is the highest paved crossing of the Continental Divide in North America , and the highest paved through road on Colorado 's state highway network . The pass is closed during the winter months , isolating Aspen from the east and making Highway 82 the only way to reach the popular ski resort town by road . A private foundation has worked with the Colorado Department of Transportation ( CDOT ) , which maintains the road , to undo environmental damage to the alpine tundra created when a disused stagecoach route built across the pass during the Colorado Silver Boom of the 1880s became Highway 82 in the early 20th century . West of Aspen the highway follows the route of an early Colorado Midland Railroad route from the city to Glenwood Springs . Paved during the 1930s , this road has been gradually expanded to four lanes over the course of the 20th and early 21st centuries . The increased traffic resulting from Aspen 's economic rebirth as a resort town has required high-occupancy vehicle lanes , bypasses and the replacement of at least one old bridge . More improvements are planned for both Aspen and Glenwood Springs .",
  "/wiki/Lixiviation": "Leaching is the process of a solute becoming detached or extracted from its carrier substance by way of a solvent . Leaching is a naturally occurring process which has been adapted to be used for a variety of applications with a variety of methods . Specific extraction methods are dependent on the soluble characteristics relative to the sorbent material such as concentration , distribution , nature , and size . Leaching can occur naturally seen from plant substances ( inorganic and organic ) , solute leaching in soil , and in the decomposition of organic materials . Leaching can also be applied affectedly to enhance water quality and contaminant removal , as well as for disposal of hazardous waste products such as fly ash , or rare earth elements ( REEs ) . It is important to understand leaching characteristics in order to prevent or encourage the leaching process and in order to be prepared for it in the case where it is inevitable . In an ideal leaching equilibrium stage , all the solute is dissolved by the solvent , leaving the carrier of the solute unchanged . The process of leaching however is not always ideal , and can be quite complex to understand and replicate , and often different methodologies will produce different results .",

It is operated by Auberge Resorts . It was built by Jerome B. Wheeler , at the time co-owner of Macy 's and a major investor in Aspen during its early boom years . He wanted the city to have a hotel that equaled European ones in its refinements and amenities . It was one of the first buildings west of the Mississippi to have full electric lighting and it has the only above ground ballroom in Aspen . It was the only hotel to remain open through the city 's quiet years in the early 20th century , as a family business run by a former bartender and his son that often served as the town 's social center . During Prohibition a celebrated spiked drink , the Aspen Crud , was invented at its J-Bar . Later , the drink and bar became popular with members of the Tenth Mountain Division while they trained in the area .

  "/wiki/Hunter_Thompson": "Hunter Stockton Thompson ( July 18 , 1937 - February 20 , 2005 ) was an American journalist and author , and the founder of the gonzo journalism movement . He first rose to prominence with the publication of Hell 's Angels ( 1967 ) , a book for which he spent a year living and riding with the Hells Angels motorcycle gang in order to write a first-hand account of the lives and experiences of its members . In 1970 , he wrote an unconventional magazine feature titled The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved for Scanlan 's Monthly which both raised his profile and established him as a writer with counterculture credibility . It also set him on a path to establishing his own sub-genre of New Journalism which he called Gonzo , which was essentially an ongoing experiment in which the writer becomes a central figure and even a participant in the events of the narrative . Thompson remains best known for Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas ( 1971 ) , a book first serialized in Rolling Stone in which he grapples with the implications of what he considered the failure of the 1960s counterculture movement . It was adapted on film twice : loosely in Where the Buffalo Roam starring Bill Murray as Thompson in 1980 , and directly in 1998 by director Terry Gilliam in a film starring Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro . The Doonesbury cartoon character Duke - who was modeled after Thompson - pens an essay about my shoplifting conviction titled Fear and Loathing at Macy 's Menswear , a reference to Thompson 's book . Politically minded , Thompson ran unsuccessfully for sheriff of Pitkin County , Colorado in 1970 on the Freak Power ticket . He became well known for his dislike of Richard Nixon , who he claimed represented that dark , venal , and incurably violent side of the American character . He covered Nixon 's 1972 reelection campaign for Rolling Stone and later collected the stories in book form as Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72 . Thompson 's output notably declined from the mid-1970s , as he struggled with the consequences of fame , and he complained that he could no longer merely report on events as he was too easily recognized . He was also known for his lifelong use of alcohol and illegal narcotics , his love of firearms , and his iconoclastic contempt for authoritarianism .",

State Highway 82 traverses it , and after Cottonwood Pass to the south , is the second highest elevation of a paved Colorado state highway on a through road . [ Note 1 ] It is also the second-highest pass with an improved road in the state , the fourth-highest paved road in the state and the second highest paved crossing of the Continental Divide in the U.S. Because of the heavy snowfall at its elevation , it is closed in wintertime , isolating Aspen from direct access from the east during the ski season . When the pass is open in warmer weather , it is a popular destination . A scenic overlook near the pass allows visitors to take in the alpine tundra environment above treeline , and offers excellent views to the east of Mount Elbert , Colorado 's highest peak and the second-highest mountain in the contiguous United States . Rock climbers are drawn to nearby bouldering opportunities , and informal paths lead to nearby mountain summits of even higher elevation . Backcountry skiers make use of the slopes during the late spring and early summer . Since 2011 the pass has been on the route of the USA Pro Cycling Challenge . The pass was formed by glacial action and erosion in the region , and its first recorded sighting was by Zebulon Pike in 1806 . Ferdinand Hayden surveyed it in 1873 .",

A town often becomes a ghost town because the economic activity that supported it ( usually industrial or agricultural ) has failed , or due to natural or human-caused disasters such as floods , prolonged droughts , government actions , uncontrolled lawlessness , war , pollution , or nuclear disasters . The term can sometimes refer to cities , towns , and neighbourhoods that are still populated , but significantly less so than in past years ; for example , those affected by high levels of unemployment and dereliction . Some ghost towns , especially those that preserve period-specific architecture , have become tourist attractions . Some examples are Bannack in the United States , Barkerville in Canada , Craco in Italy , Kolmanskop in Namibia , Pripyat in Ukraine , and Danushkodi in India . The town of Plymouth on the Caribbean island of Montserrat is a ghost town that is the de jure capital of Montserrat . It was rendered uninhabitable by volcanic ash from an eruption of the Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano .",
  "/wiki/La_Fave_Block": "The La Fave Block is located at the intersection of East Cooper Avenue and South Hunter Street in Aspen , Colorado , United States . It is a brick commercial building erected in the late 1880s , during the initial mining boom that created Aspen . Today it is the second oldest brick commercial building in the city , and , along with its neighbors on East Cooper , the only structure left built by Frank LaFave , one of Aspen 's early settlers . It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 . Its ornate Victorian architecture and idiosyncratic fenestration has survived , and it has become one of the most valuable commercial properties in contemporary Aspen due to its location a short distance from the Aspen Mountain ski resort 's main lifts . At one point in the 20th century it was the office of an important local architect ; and later a ski shop run by Olympic gold medalist Stein Eriksen . Its primary tenant is a clothing store run by Leonard Boogie Weinglass , the man said to have inspired a character portrayed by Mickey Rourke . In 2008 it sold for $ 14.6 million .",
  "/wiki/Maroon_Creek_Bridge": "The original Maroon Creek Bridge is a steel trestle along State Highway 82 at the western boundary of Aspen , Colorado , United States . It was designed by George S. Morison in 1888 for the Colorado Midland Railroad , one of the last viaducts in Colorado built for a standard gauge mountain railroad in the 19th century . Of the five steel bridges the Midland built , it is the only one still extant . Due to the later removal of most track and the rail depots , the bridge is the most visible remnant of rail service to Aspen . In 1985 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places along with other highway bridges in the state , including the Sheely Bridge , also in Aspen . When it was built , the Midland was ahead in its race with the Denver and Rio Grande to make the first rail connection to Aspen , then a booming silver mining center . The Midland had followed the Roaring Fork Valley up from its main line at Glenwood Springs , but was stalled at Maroon Creek by a delay in the bridge steel . The Rio Grande was thus able to make up the difference and bring the first train to Aspen , with the Midland following a few months later . Aspen 's boom years ended a few years later , and by the 1920s the bridge was abandoned . It was soon expanded and converted to use as a road bridge . It served as the main entrance to Aspen for many visitors as the city 's economy rebounded when the Aspen Mountain ski resort was developed after World War II . As growth spilled over to Aspen 's west , it became a traffic choke point for the region .",

  "/wiki/Shingle_Style": "The Shingle style is an American architectural style made popular by the rise of the New England school of architecture , which eschewed the highly ornamented patterns of the Eastlake style in Queen Anne architecture . In the Shingle style , English influence was combined with the renewed interest in Colonial American architecture which followed the 1876 celebration of the Centennial . The plain , shingled surfaces of colonial buildings were adopted , and their massing emulated . Aside from being a style of design , the style also conveyed a sense of the house as continuous volume . This effect - of the building as an envelope of space , rather than a great mass , was enhanced by the visual tautness of the flat shingled surfaces , the horizontal shape of many Shingle style houses , and the emphasis on horizontal continuity , both in exterior details and in the flow of spaces within the houses .",
  "/wiki/Osgood_Castle": "Redstone Castle , also known as Cleveholm or Osgood Castle , is a mansion south of Redstone , Colorado , United States . It is a large timber frame structure built in the early 20th century as the home of John C. Osgood , founder of the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company , in a simplified version of the Stick style . In 1971 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places , the first property in Pitkin County to be listed . It was later additionally listed as a contributing property to the Redstone Historic District . The castle was at the south end of the planned company town of Redstone , meant by Osgood to be an improvement over the usual housing and conditions in Western mining towns of the late 19th century . Just across the Crystal River were the coke ovens that processed coal mined higher up in the mountains and loaded onto a rail line . Miners and cokers in the town lived in cottages with electricity and running water , considered luxury items at the time . At his mansion , Osgood , at the time one of the country 's richest men , entertained guests like Theodore Roosevelt , John D. Rockefeller and King Leopold of Belgium , who joined him on hunts . The lush interior features European antique furniture and work by Gustav Stickley and Louis Comfort Tiffany . Its design was supposedly based on the ancestral home of Osgood 's wife Alma . Redstone 's prosperity ended within a decade , after Osgood lost control of the company , and he spent less time there . He returned to the property in the late 1920s to die .",

  "/wiki/Online_auction": "An online auction ( also electronic auction or E-Auction or e-auction or eAuction ) is an auction which is held over the internet . Online auctions come in many different formats , but most popularly they are ascending English auctions , descending Dutch auctions , first-price sealed-bid , Vickrey auctions , or sometimes even a combination of multiple auctions , taking elements of one and forging them with another . The scope and reach of these auctions have been propelled by the Internet to a level beyond what the initial purveyors had anticipated . This is mainly because online auctions break down and remove the physical limitations of traditional auctions such as geography , presence , time , space , and a small target audience . This influx in reachability has also made it easier to commit unlawful actions within an auction . In 2002 , online auctions were projected to account for 30% of all online e-commerce due to the rapid expansion of the popularity of the form of electronic commerce . Online auctions include business to business ( B2B ) , business to consumer ( B2C ) , and consumer to consumer ( C2C ) auctions . The largest online auction site is eBay , which was the first to support person-to-person transactions . Other popular examples of online auction sites include WebStore , OnlineAuction and Overstock ."
