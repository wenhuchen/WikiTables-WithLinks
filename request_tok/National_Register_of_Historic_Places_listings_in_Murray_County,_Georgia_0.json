  "/wiki/Fort_Mountain_(Murray_County,_Georgia)": "Fort Mountain is a mountain in northern Georgia , just east of Chatsworth . It is part of the Cohutta Mountains , a small mountain range at the southern end of the Appalachian Mountains . It also lies within the Chattahoochee National Forest . Fort Mountain takes its name from a peak that has remnants of a stone formation around part of that peak . The stones , which are from the local area around the summit , are piled in a 928 feet ( 283 m ) -long discontinuous zig-zag line . Stone piles may be formed naturally by the thrust that causes a ridge to crest during the mountain 's formation . Early visitors referred to the formation as a fort , speculating that it was built by Hernando de Soto to defend against the Creek Indians around 1540 . However , this theory was contradicted as early as 1917 , as a historian pointed out that de Soto was in the area for less than two weeks . The original construction and function of the formation as a fort is less accepted today and its origin remains unknown . The structure is believed to have been crafted by pre-Columbian Native Americans . Early historians attributed the stone piles to a race of moon-eyed people , said to predate the Cherokee . The earliest known mention of this was by Benjamin Smith Barton ( 1766-1815 ) .",
