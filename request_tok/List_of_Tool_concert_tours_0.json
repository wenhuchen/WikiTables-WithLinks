The circuit business is now owned by Jonathan Palmer 's MotorSport Vision organisation , and the surrounding Donington Park Estate , still owned by the Wheatcroft family , is currently under lease by MotorSport Vision until 2038 . Originally part of the Donington Hall estate , it was created as a racing circuit during the period between the First and Second World Wars when the German Silver Arrows were battling for the European Championship . Used as a military vehicle storage depot during the Second World War , it fell into disrepair until bought by local construction entrepreneur Tom Wheatcroft . Revived under his ownership in the 1970s , it hosted a single Formula One race , but became the favoured home of the British round of the MotoGP motorcycling championship . Leased by Donington Ventures Leisure Ltd in 2007 the hope that Formula One racing could return to the track , the incomplete venture failed to raise sufficient financial backing during the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis . DVLL consequently lost the rights to the British rounds of both Formula 1 and MotoGP , and in its bankruptcy returned the track to the Wheatcroft family in December 2009 . Under Wheatcroft 's ownership , the venue underwent significant work , with the track restored to use in 2010 , before major upgrades in the following five years . At the end of 2010 , it was announced that Donington would become home to an annual historic motorsport event , the Donington Historic Festival , with new events constantly being added .

  "/wiki/Tabla": "The tabla [ nb 1 ] is a membranophone percussion instrument originating from the Indian subcontinent , consisting of a pair of drums , used in traditional , classical , popular and folk music . It has been a particularly important instrument in Hindustani classical music since the 18th century , and remains in use in India , Bangladesh , Pakistan , Afghanistan , Nepal , and Sri Lanka . The name tabla likely comes from tabl , the Persian and Arabic word for drum . However , the ultimate origin of the musical instrument is contested by scholars , some tracing it to West Asia , others tracing the evolution of indigenous musical instruments of the Indian subcontinent . The tabla consists of two single-headed , barrel-shaped small drums of slightly different size and shape : daya also called dahina meaning right ( also called tabla ) , and baya also called bahina meaning left ( also called dagga ) . The daya tabla is played by the musician 's right hand ( dominant hand ) , and is about 15 centimetres ( ~6 in ) in diameter and 25 centimetres ( ~10 in ) high . The baya tabla is a bit bigger and deep kettledrum shaped , about 20 centimetres ( ~8 in ) in diameter and 25 centimetres ( ~10 in ) in height . Each is made of hollowed out wood or clay or brass , the daya drum laced with hoops , thongs and wooden dowels on its sides . The dowels and hoops are used to tighten the tension of the membrane . The daya is tuned to the ground note of the raga called Sa ( tonic in India music ) . The baya construction and tuning is about a fifth to an octave below that of the daya drum . The musician uses his hand 's heel pressure to change the pitch and tone colour of each drum during a performance .",

  "/wiki/Guitar": "The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that usually has six strings . It is typically played with both hands by strumming or plucking the strings with either a guitar pick or the fingers/fingernails of one hand , while simultaneously fretting ( pressing the strings against the frets ) with the fingers of the other hand . The sound of the vibrating strings is projected either acoustically , by means of the hollow chamber of the guitar ( for an acoustic guitar ) , or through an electrical amplifier and a speaker . The guitar is a type of chordophone , traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut , nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning . The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern , the vihuela , the four-course Renaissance guitar , and the five-course baroque guitar , all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument . There are three main types of modern acoustic guitar : the classical guitar ( Spanish guitar/nylon-string guitar ) , the steel-string acoustic guitar , and the archtop guitar , which is sometimes called a jazz guitar . The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings ' vibration , amplified by the hollow body of the guitar , which acts as a resonating chamber . The classical guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive finger-picking technique where each string is plucked individually by the player 's fingers , as opposed to being strummed . The term finger-picking can also refer to a specific tradition of folk , blues , bluegrass , and country guitar playing in the United States . The acoustic bass guitar is a low-pitched instrument that is one octave below a regular guitar . Electric guitars , introduced in the 1930s , use an amplifier and a loudspeaker that both makes the sound of the instrument loud enough for the performers and audience to hear , and , given that it produces an electric signal when played , that can electronically manipulate and shape the tone using an equalizer ( e.g. , bass and treble tone controls ) and a huge variety of electronic effects units , the most commonly used ones being distortion ( or overdrive ) and reverb . Early amplified guitars employed a hollow body , but solid wood guitars began to dominate during the 1960s and 1970s , as they are less prone to unwanted acoustic feedback howls .",

The band has earned a large cult following . They were ranked No . 87 on VH1 's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock . Although considered to be a seminal progressive rock band ( a genre characterised by extended instrumental sections and complex song structures ) , they have often distanced themselves from the genre : as well as influencing several generations of progressive and psychedelic rock bands , they have also been an influence on subsequent alternative metal , hardcore and experimental/noise musicians . Developed from the unsuccessful psychedelic pop trio Giles , Giles and Fripp , the initial King Crimson were key to the formation of early progressive rock , strongly influencing and altering the music of contemporaries such as Yes and Genesis . Their debut album , In the Court of the Crimson King ( 1969 ) , remains their most successful and influential release , with its elements of jazz , classical and experimental music . Their success increased following an opening act performance for the Rolling Stones at Hyde Park , London , in 1969 . Following In the Wake of Poseidon ( 1970 ) and the less successful chamber jazz-inspired Lizard ( 1970 ) , and Islands ( 1971 ) , the group reformatted and changed their instrumentation ( swapping out saxophone in favour of violin and unusual percussion ) in order to develop their own take on European rock improvisation , reaching a new creative peak on Larks ' Tongues in Aspic ( 1973 ) , Starless and Bible Black ( 1974 ) and Red ( 1974 ) .

Under the fingers of a sensitive performer , the keyboard may also be used to control dynamics , phrasing , shading , articulation , and other elements of expression - depending on the design and inherent capabilities of the instrument . Another important use of the word keyboard is in historical musicology , where it means an instrument whose identity can not be firmly established . Particularly in the 18th century , the harpsichord , the clavichord , and the early piano were in competition , and the same piece might be played on more than one .

  "/wiki/Synthesizer": "A synthesizer ( UK : synthesiser ) is an electronic musical instrument that generates audio signals . Synthesizers generate audio through methods including subtractive synthesis , additive synthesis , and frequency modulation synthesis . These sounds may be shaped and modulated by components such as filters , envelopes , and low-frequency oscillators . Synthesizers are typically sequenced , controlled by software or instruments via MIDI , or played with keyboards or other controllers . Synthesizer-like instruments emerged in the United States in the mid-20th century with instruments such as the RCA Mark II , which was controlled with punch cards and composed of hundreds of vacuum tubes . The Moog synthesizer , developed by Robert Moog and first sold in 1964 , is credited for pioneering analog synthesis concepts such as the voltage-controlled oscillator , envelopes , noise generators , filters , and sequencers . In 1970 , the cheaper , smaller Minimoog standardized synthesizers as self-contained instruments with built-in keyboards , compared to the larger modular synthesizers before it . The first mass-produced synthesizer , the Yamaha DX7 , was launched in 1983 , popularizing digital synthesis . Software synthesizers now can be embedded on single microchips in any electronic device . Synthesizers were initially viewed as avant-garde , valued by the 1960s psychedelic and counter-cultural scenes . Switched-On Bach ( 1968 ) , a bestselling album of Bach compositions arranged for synthesizer by Wendy Carlos , took synthesizers to the mainstream . They were adopted by electronic acts and pop and rock groups in the 1960s and 1970s , and widely used in 1980s pop .",

It is a plucked string instrument similar in appearance and construction to an electric or an acoustic guitar , except with a longer neck and scale length , and typically four to six strings or courses . Since the mid-1950s , the electric bass has largely replaced the double bass in popular music . The four-string bass is usually tuned the same as the double bass , which corresponds to pitches one octave lower than the four lowest-pitched strings of a guitar ( E , A , D , and G ) . It is played primarily with the fingers or thumb , or striking with a pick . The electric bass guitar has pickups and must be connected to an amplifier and speaker to be loud enough to compete with other instruments .",

After releasing an EP under the name Sons of Kyuss in 1990 , the band shortened its name to Kyuss and recruited Nick Oliveri , replacing Cockrell as bassist . Over the next five years the band released four full-length albums , and one last split EP in 1997 as Kyuss and the newly formed Queens of the Stone Age . This tied up the loose ends of Kyuss and introduced the new band Queens of the Stone Age , which was initially composed entirely of former Kyuss members . Oliveri left the band in 1992 and was replaced by Scott Reeder just prior to the release of Blues for the Red Sun . Drummer Bjork decided to leave the band in 1994 , citing creative differences and a disdain for touring , and was replaced by Alfredo Hern\u00e1ndez , formerly of fellow-Palm Desert band Yawning Man .
