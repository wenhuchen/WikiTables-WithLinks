It is composed of nine federated states ( Bundesl\u00e4nder ) , one of which is Vienna , Austria 's capital and its largest city . It is bordered by Germany to the northwest , Czech Republic to the north , Slovakia to the northeast , Hungary to the east , Slovenia and Italy to the south , and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west . Austria occupies an area of 83,879 km2 ( 32,386 sq mi ) and has a population of nearly 9 million people . While German is the country 's official language , many Austrians communicate informally in a variety of Bavarian dialects . Austria initially emerged as a margraviate around 976 and developed into a duchy and archduchy . In the 16th century , Austria started serving as the heart of the Habsburg Monarchy and the junior branch of the House of Habsburg - one of the most influential royal dynasties in history . As an archduchy , it was a major component and administrative centre of the Holy Roman Empire . Early in the 19th century , Austria established its own empire , which became a great power and the leading force of the German Confederation but pursued its own course independently of the other German states . Following the Austro-Prussian War and the compromise with Hungary , the Dual Monarchy was established . Austria was involved in World War I under Emperor Franz Joseph following the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand , the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne . After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy , the Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed with the intent of the union with Germany , which eventually failed because of the Allied Powers and the state remained unrecognized .",

  "/wiki/Team_time_trial": "A team time trial ( TTT ) is a road-based bicycle race in which teams of cyclists race against the clock ( see individual time trial for a more detailed description of ITT events ) . The winning team in a TTT is determined by the comparing the times of ( usually ) the fourth-finishing rider in each team ( though the relevant finish position can be otherwise specified in advance by the race organisers ) . This means that each team will try to get their first four ( at least ) riders across the finish line in a tight group : it is actually a disadvantage for any rider to finish far in advance of the fourth rider , as by staying back a faster rider can help the fourth rider to get a quicker time . Where a TTT is part of a stage race , it is necessary for each rider to be given a finish time that can be cumulated into the general classification timings . Hence , all riders in the team who finish in the leading bunch are given the time of the fourth rider , and any rider who has been dropped is timed individually in the usual way . Teams start at equal intervals , usually two , three or four minutes apart . Starting sequences will usually be based on individuals ' times in previous events , but in TTTs conducted as part of a multi-stage road race ( such as the Tour de France and the Giro d'Italia ) the highest ranked teams will normally start later . Later starters have the advantage of knowing what times they need to beat ( and this also makes the event more interesting to spectators ) . Unlike individual time trials where competitors are not permitted to 'draft ' ( ride in the slipstream ) behind each other , in team time trials , riders in each team employ this as their main tactic , each member taking a turn at the front while teammates 'sit in ' behind . After their turn , the lead rider will swing over , allowing the next rider to take the lead , while the leader goes to the back of the team . Should one team overtake another , the overtaken team would be expected to drop back .",
