  "/wiki/Bugs_Bunny": "Bugs Bunny is an animated cartoon character , created in the late 1930s by Leon Schlesinger Productions ( later Warner Bros. Cartoons ) and voiced originally by Mel Blanc . Bugs is best known for his starring roles in the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of animated short films , produced by Warner Bros . Though a similar character called Happy Rabbit debuted in the WB cartoon Porky 's Hare Hunt ( 1938 ) and appeared in a few subsequent shorts , the definitive character of Bugs is widely credited to have made his debut in director Tex Avery 's Oscar-nominated film A Wild Hare ( 1940 ) . Bugs is an anthropomorphic gray and white rabbit or hare who is famous for his flippant , insouciant personality . He is also characterized by a Brooklyn accent , his portrayal as a trickster , and his catch phrase Eh.What 's up , doc ? . Due to Bugs ' popularity during the golden age of American animation , he became not only an American cultural icon and the official mascot of Warner Bros. Entertainment , but also one of the most recognizable characters in the world . He can thus be seen in the older Warner Bros. company logos . Since his debut , Bugs has appeared in various short films , feature films , compilations , TV series , music records , comics , video games , award shows , amusement park rides , and commercials . He has also appeared in more films than any other cartoon character , is the 9th most-portrayed film personality in the world , and has his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame .",

Cartoons on the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts . He wrote , produced , and/or directed many classic animated cartoon shorts starring Bugs Bunny , Daffy Duck , Wile E.

He later started his own studio , Chuck Jones Enterprises , which created several one-shot specials , and periodically worked on Looney Tunes related works . Jones was nominated for eight Academy Awards , winning three times . He won for the cartoons For Scent-imental Reasons , So Much for So Little , and The Dot and the Line . Robin Williams presented Jones with an Honorary Academy Award in 1996 for his iconic work in the animation industry . Film historian Leonard Maltin has praised Jones ' work at Warner Bros. , MGM and Chuck Jones Enterprises . He also said that the feud that there may have been between Jones and colleague Bob Clampett was mainly because they were so different from each other . In Jerry Beck 's The 50 Greatest Cartoons , ten of the entries were directed by Jones , with four out of the five top cartoons ( including first place ) being Jones shorts .",

  "/wiki/Porky_Pig": "Porky Pig is an animated character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons . He was the first character created by the studio to draw audiences based on his star power , and the animators created many critically acclaimed shorts featuring the character . Even after he was supplanted by later characters , Porky continued to be popular with moviegoers and , more importantly , the Warners directors , who recast him in numerous everyman and sidekick roles . He is known for his signature line at the end of many shorts , Th-th-th-that 's all folks ! This slogan ( without stuttering ) had also been used by both Bosko and Buddy and even Beans at the end of Looney Tunes cartoons . In contrast , the Merrie Melodies series used the slogan : So Long , Folks ! until the mid 1930s when it was replaced with the same one used on the Looney Tunes series ( when Bugs Bunny was the closing character , he would break the pattern by simply saying , in his Brooklynese accent , And Dat 's De End ! ) . He is the oldest continuing Looney Tunes character . Porky 's most distinctive trait is a severe stutter , for which he sometimes compensates by replacing his words ; for example , What 's going on ? might become What 's guh-guh-guh-guh - .what 's happening ? Porky 's age varied widely in the series ; originally conceived as an innocent seven-year-old piglet ( explicitly mentioned as such in Porky 's Preview ) , Porky was more frequently cast as an adult , often being cast as the competent straight man in the series in later years . In the ending of many Looney Tunes cartoons , Porky Pig bursts through a bass drum head , and his attempt to close the show with The End becomes Th-Th-The , Th-Th-The , Th-Th .",

He has one of the more disputed origins in the Warner Bros. cartoon pantheon ( second only to Bugs himself ) . His aim is to hunt Bugs , but he usually ends up seriously injuring himself and other antagonizing characters . He speaks in an unusual way , replacing his Rs and Ls with Ws , so he always refers to Bugs Bunny as a scwewy wabbit . Elmer 's signature catchphrase is , Shhh . Be vewy vewy quiet , I 'm hunting wabbits , as well as his trademark laughter . The best known Elmer Fudd cartoons include Chuck Jones ' work What 's Opera , Doc ?

Unlike her previous appearances , the usually cheerful Granny here is a female caricature of Ralph Kramden ( of television 's The Honeymooners ) , complete with ill-temperedness and use of the catchphrase , One of these days . pow ! Right in the kisser . As such , Red Riding Hoodwinked marked one of the earliest parodies of The Honeymooners .

  "/wiki/Tom_Thumb_in_Trouble": "Tom Thumb is a character of English folklore . The History of Tom Thumb was published in 1621 , and was the first fairy tale printed in English . Tom is no bigger than his father 's thumb , and his adventures include being swallowed by a cow , tangling with giants , and becoming a favourite of King Arthur . The earliest allusions to Tom occur in various 16th-century works such as Reginald Scot 's Discovery of Witchcraft ( 1584 ) , where Tom is cited as one of the supernatural folk employed by servant maids to frighten children . Tattershall in Lincolnshire , England , reputedly has the home and grave of Tom Thumb . Aside from his own tales , Tom figures in Henry Fielding 's play Tom Thumb , a companion piece to his The Author 's Farce . It was later expanded into a single piece titled The Tragedy of Tragedies , or the History of Tom Thumb the Great . In the middle 18th century , books began to be published specifically for children ( some with their authorship attributed to Tommy Thumb ) , and by the middle 19th century , Tom was a fixture of the nursery library . The tale took on moral overtones and some writers , such as Charlotte Yonge , cleansed questionable passages . Dinah Mulock however refrained from scrubbing the tale of its vulgarities . Tom Thumb 's story has been adapted into several films .",

  "/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Kitties": "A Tale of Two Kitties is a 1942 Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Bob Clampett , written by Warren Foster , and features music by Carl W. Stalling . This short subject is notable for being Tweety Bird 's debut , although known as Orson in this short , according to the staff . It was also the first appearance of Babbit and Catstello , based on the popular comedy duo Abbott and Costello . The title is an obvious pun on the Charles Dickens classic , A Tale of Two Cities . Even in this initial appearance , Tweety reveals early on that his cute appearance masks a willingness to be merciless , even sadistic , towards anyone who threatens him . After slipping one of the cats a bomb which explodes ( offscreen ) , the bird remarks , Aw , da poor putty tat - he cwushed his widdow head ! Followed by a big grin . ( This line was patterned after a catchphrase from a Red Skelton character , and would be used in other Warner cartoons , such as Easter Yeggs . ) This is one of the few Tweety shorts that did not feature his main antagonist Sylvester , who would make his official debut in Life with Feathers ( 1945 ) . A Tale of Two Kitties is remarkable due to a clearly adult reference in 1942 . Catstello broke the fourth wall , took a direct shot at the Hays Office , and made a thinly-veiled reference to giving the middle finger . United Artists failed to renew the copyright in time in 1970 , so the short is now in the public domain in the United States .",

In his later years , Clampett toured college campuses and animation festivals as a lecturer on the history of animation .
