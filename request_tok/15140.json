  "/wiki/Marco_Pantani": "Marco Pantani ( Italian pronunciation : [ \u02c8marko pan\u02c8ta\u02d0ni ] ; 13 January 1970 - 14 February 2004 ) was an Italian road racing cyclist , widely considered one of the best climbers of all time in professional road bicycle racing . He won both the Tour de France and the Giro d'Italia in 1998 , being the sixth Italian after Ottavio Bottecchia , Gino Bartali , Fausto Coppi , Felice Gimondi and Gastone Nencini to win the Tour de France . He is the last cyclist , and one of only seven , to win the Giro and the Tour in the same year . Pantani 's attacking style and aggressive riding turned him into a fan favorite in the late 1990s . He was known as Il Pirata ( English : The pirate ) because of his shaven head and the rakish bandana and earrings he always wore . At 1.72 m and 57 kg , he had the classic build for a mountain climber . His style contrasted with that of time-trialling experts such as the five-times Tour winner Miguel Indurain . Although Pantani never tested positive during his career , his career was beset by doping allegations . In the 1999 Giro d'Italia , he was expelled due to his irregular blood values . Although he was disqualified for health reasons , it was implied that Pantani 's high haematocrit was the product of EPO use . Following later accusations , Pantani went into a severe mental depression from which he never fully recovered . He died of acute cocaine poisoning in 2004 .",
