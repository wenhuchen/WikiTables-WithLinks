  "/wiki/Cha-cha-cha_(dance)": "The Cha Cha Cha ( sometimes called cha-cha ) , is a dance of Cuban origin . It is danced to the music of the same name introduced by Cuban composer and violinist Enrique Jorrin in the early 1950s . This rhythm was developed from the danz\u00f3n-mambo . The name of the dance is an onomatopoeia derived from the shuffling sound of the dancers ' feet when they dance two consecutive quick steps ( correctly , on the fourth count of each measure ) that characterize the dance . In the early 1950s , Enrique Jorr\u00edn worked as a violinist and composer with the charanga group Orquesta Am\u00e9rica . The group performed at dance halls in Havana where they played danz\u00f3n , danzonete , and danzon-mambo for dance-oriented crowds . Jorr\u00edn noticed that many of the dancers at these gigs had difficulty with the syncopated rhythms of the danz\u00f3n-mambo . To make his music more appealing to dancers , Jorr\u00edn began composing songs where the melody was marked strongly on the first downbeat and the rhythm was less syncopated . When Orquesta Am\u00e9rica performed these new compositions at the Silver Star Club in Havana , it was noticed that the dancers had improvised a triple step in their footwork producing the sound cha-cha-cha . Thus , the new style came to be known as cha-cha-ch\u00e1 and became associated with a dance where dancers perform a triple step . The basic footwork pattern of cha-cha-ch\u00e1 ( one , two , three , cha-cha ) is also found in several Afro-Cuban dances from the Santer\u00eda religion . For example , one of the steps used in the dance for the orisha Ogun uses an identical footwork pattern .",

  "/wiki/Rock_'n'_Roll": "Rock and roll ( often written as rock & roll , rock ' n ' roll or rock ' n roll ) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s from musical styles such as gospel , jump blues , jazz , boogie woogie , rhythm and blues , and country music . While elements of what was to become rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s , the genre did not acquire its name until 1954 . According to Greg Kot , rock and roll refers to a style of popular music originating in the U.S. in the 1950s prior to its development by the mid-1960s into the more encompassing international style known as rock music , though the latter also continued to be known as rock and roll . For the purpose of differentiation , this article deals with the first definition . In the earliest rock and roll styles , either the piano or saxophone was typically the lead instrument , but these instruments were generally replaced or supplemented by guitar in the middle to late 1950s . The beat is essentially a dance rhythm with an accentuated backbeat , which is almost always provided by a snare drum . Classic rock and roll is usually played with one or two electric guitars ( one lead , one rhythm ) , a double bass or string bass or ( after the mid-1950s ) an electric bass guitar , and a drum kit . Beyond simply a musical style , rock and roll , as seen in movies , in fan magazines , and on television , influenced lifestyles , fashion , attitudes , and language . In addition , rock and roll may have contributed to the civil rights movement because both African-American and white American teenagers enjoyed the music . It went on to spawn various genres , often without the initially characteristic backbeat , that are now more commonly called rock music or simply rock .",
  "/wiki/Salsa_(dance)": "Salsa is a Latin dance associated with the music genre of the same name which originated in the 1960s in New York City . Salsa is an amalgamation of Cuban dances that were popular in the ballrooms and nightclubs of Havana by the end of the 1950s ( e.g . casino , mambo and pachanga ) , as well as American jazz dances . It was primarily developed by Puerto Ricans living in New York ( Nuyoricans ) in the late 1960s and early 1970s . Different regions of Latin America and the United States have distinct salsa styles of their own , such as Cuban , Puerto Rican , Cali Colombia , L.A. and New York styles . Salsa dance socials are commonly held in nightclubs , bars , ballrooms , restaurants , and outside , especially when part of an outdoor festival . In many styles of salsa dancing , as a dancer shifts their weight by stepping , the upper body remains level and nearly unaffected by the weight changes . Weight shifts cause the hips to move . Arm and shoulder movements are also incorporated . Salsa generally uses music ranging from about 150 bpm ( beats per minute ) to around 250 bpm , although most dancing is done to music somewhere between 160-220 bpm . The basic Salsa dance rhythm consists of taking three steps for every four beats of music . The odd number of steps creates the syncopation inherent to Salsa dancing and ensures that it takes 8 beats of music to loop back to a new sequence of steps .",
  "/wiki/Viennese_Waltz": "Viennese waltz ( German : Wiener Walzer ) is a genre of ballroom dance . At least four different meanings are recognized . In the historically first sense , the name may refer to several versions of the waltz , including the earliest waltzes done in ballroom dancing , danced to the music of Viennese waltz . What is now called the Viennese waltz is the original form of the waltz . It was the first ballroom dance performed in the closed hold or waltz position . The dance that is popularly known as the waltz is actually the English or slow waltz , danced at approximately 90 beats per minute with 3 beats to the bar ( the international standard of 30 measures per minute ) , while the Viennese waltz is danced at about 180 beats ( 58-60 measures ) per minute . To this day however , in Germany , Austria , Scandinavia , and France , the words Walzer ( German ) , vals ( Danish , Norwegian , and Swedish ) , and valse ( French ) still implicitly refer to the original dance and not the slow waltz . The Viennese waltz is a rotary dance where the dancers are constantly turning either toward the leader 's right ( natural ) or toward the leader 's left ( reverse ) , interspersed with non-rotating change steps to switch between the direction of rotation . As the waltz evolved , some of the versions that were done at about the original fast tempo came to be called specifically Viennese waltz to distinguish them from the slower waltzes . In the modern ballroom dance , two versions of Viennese waltz are recognized : International Style and American Style . Today the Viennese waltz is a ballroom and partner dance that is part of the International Standard division of contemporary ballroom dance .",
