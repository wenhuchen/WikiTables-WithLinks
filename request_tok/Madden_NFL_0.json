  "/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_(fifth_generation)": "The fifth-generation era ( also known as the 32-bit era , the 64-bit era , or the 3D era ) refers to computer and video games , video game consoles , and handheld gaming consoles dating from approximately October 4 , 1993 to March 23 , 2006 . [ note 1 ] For home consoles , the best-selling console was the Sony PlayStation , followed by the Nintendo 64 , and then the Sega Saturn . The PlayStation also had a redesigned version , the PSone , which was launched on July 7 , 2000 . For handhelds , this era was characterized by significant fragmentation , because the first handheld of the generation , the Sega Nomad , had a lifespan of just two years , and the Nintendo Virtual Boy had a lifespan of less than one . Both of them were discontinued before the other handhelds made their debut . The Neo Geo Pocket was released on October 28 , 1998 , but was dropped by SNK in favor of the fully backwards-compatible Neo Geo Pocket Color just a year later . Nintendo 's Game Boy Color ( 1998 ) was the winner in handhelds by a large margin . There were also two simply updated versions of the original Game Boy : Game Boy Light ( Japan only ) and Game Boy Pocket . Some features that distinguished fifth generation consoles from previous fourth generation consoles include :",

Collectively , MS-DOS , its rebranding as IBM PC DOS , and some operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS , are sometimes referred to as DOS ( which is also the generic acronym for disk operating system ) . MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s , from which point it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface ( GUI ) , in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system . IBM licensed and re-released it in 1981 , as PC DOS 1.0 for use in its PCs . Although MS-DOS and PC DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM , the two products diverged after twelve years , in 1993 , with recognizable differences in compatibility , syntax , and capabilities . During its lifetime , several competing products were released for the x86 platform , and MS-DOS went through eight versions , until development ceased in 2000 . Initially , MS-DOS was targeted at Intel 8086 processors running on computer hardware using floppy disks to store and access not only the operating system , but application software and user data as well . Progressive version releases delivered support for other mass storage media in ever greater sizes and formats , along with added feature support for newer processors and rapidly evolving computer architectures . Ultimately , it was the key product in Microsoft 's development from a programming language company to a diverse software development firm , providing the company with essential revenue and marketing resources . It was also the underlying basic operating system on which early versions of Windows ran as a GUI . It is a flexible operating system , and consumes negligible installation space .",

It was the first Madden game to use the famous EA Sports - It 's in the Game audio tag . It also introduced the Flip play , Play-call mode , Pass-catch mode and Bluff play options to the series .

The field could also be rotated to view plays from any angle in instant replay . This was also the first of the Madden games to have Super Bowl teams available for play without any special codes . Due to an error , the entire rosters for the New York Giants and New York Jets were reversed . For example , the quarterback for the Jets was # 11 ( Phil Simms of the Giants ) while the quarterback for the Giants was # 7 ( Boomer Esiason of the Jets ) .

Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 .

On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones .

As a fifth generation console , the PlayStation primarily competed with the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn . The PlayStation was the first computer entertainment platform to ship over 100 million units , which it had reached nine years after its initial launch . In July 2000 , a redesigned , slim version called the PS one was released , replacing the original grey console and named appropriately to avoid confusion with its successor , the PlayStation 2 .
