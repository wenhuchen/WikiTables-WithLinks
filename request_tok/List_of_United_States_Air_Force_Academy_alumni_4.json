  "/wiki/Legend_Airlines": "Legend Airlines was an airline headquartered at Dallas Love Field , Dallas , Texas , United States . Legend operated nonstop flights from its Love Field hub to Washington D.C. , Las Vegas , Los Angeles and New York City , the first carrier to fly from Love Field to destinations beyond the Wright Amendment five-state region after the opening of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in 1974 . Legend 's jet airliners were limited to 56 passenger seats by the Wright Amendment , so the aircraft were outfitted in a spacious all-business class layout , aiming at the lucrative business travel market . Legend 's initial flights were substantially delayed by lobbying to persuade Congress to modify the Wright Amendment , court battles instigated by American Airlines and the City of Fort Worth , and by difficulties obtaining operational approval from the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) . Flights began in April 2000 , but were suspended indefinitely in December 2000 due to mounting losses , with the airline filing for bankruptcy . Efforts to secure additional financing and restart flights came to naught ; the airline surrendered its operating certificate and was liquidated in mid-2001 . The airline 's private Love Field terminal - which was independently owned and leased to the carrier - was condemned under eminent domain and the gates razed after the 2006 Wright Amendment repeal imposed a 20-gate cap at the airport . These events triggered a series of lawsuits that were not fully settled until 2016 .",
