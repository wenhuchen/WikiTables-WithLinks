The decoration is issued to members of the eight uniformed services of the United States as well as to military and political figures of foreign governments . The Legion of Merit ( Commander degree ) is one of only two United States military decorations to be issued as a neck order ( the other being the Medal of Honor ) and the only United States military decoration that may be issued in award degrees ( much like an order of chivalry or certain Orders of Merit ) , although the degrees including a neck ribbon are only awarded to non-U.S. nationals . The Legion of Merit is seventh in the order of precedence of all U.S. military awards and is worn after the Defense Superior Service Medal and before the Distinguished Flying Cross . In contemporary use in the U.S. Armed Forces , the Legion of Merit is typically awarded to Army , Marine Corps , and Air Force general officers and colonels , and Navy and Coast Guard flag officers and captains occupying senior command or very senior staff positions in their respective services .

  "/wiki/Killed_in_action": "Killed in action ( KIA ) is a casualty classification generally used by militaries to describe the deaths of their own combatants at the hands of hostile forces . The United States Department of Defense , for example , says that those declared KIA need not have fired their weapons but have been killed due to hostile attack . KIAs include those killed by friendly fire in the midst of combat , but not from incidents such as accidental vehicle crashes , murder and other non-hostile events or terrorism . KIA can be applied both to front-line combat troops and to naval , air and support troops . Someone who is killed in action during a particular event is denoted with a \u2020 ( dagger ) beside their name to signify their death in that event or events . [ citation needed ] Further , KIA denotes a person to have been killed in action on the battlefield whereas died of wounds ( DOW ) relates to someone who survived to reach a medical treatment facility . The North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) also uses DWRIA , rather than DOW , for died of wounds received in action . However , historically , militaries and historians have used the former acronym . [ citation needed ] PKIA means presumed killed in action . This term is used when personnel are lost in battle , initially listed missing in action ( MIA ) , but after not being found , are later presumed to have not survived .",
  "/wiki/Operation_Red_Wings": "Operation Red Wings , informally referred to as the Battle of Abbas Ghar ( often incorrectly called Operation Redwing or Operation Red Wing ) , was a combined / joint military operation during the War in Afghanistan in the Pech District of Afghanistan 's Kunar Province , on the slopes of a mountain named Sawtalo Sar , approximately 20 miles ( 32 km ) west of Kunar 's provincial capital of Asadabad , in late June through mid-July 2005 . Operation Red Wings was intended to disrupt local anti-coalition militia ( ACM ) activity , thus contributing to regional stability and thereby facilitating the Afghan Parliament elections scheduled for September 2005 . At the time , anti-coalition militia activity in the region was carried out most notably by a small group , led by a local man from Nangarhar Province , Ahmad Shah , who had aspirations of regional Islamic fundamentalist prominence . He and his small group were among the primary targets of the operation . The operation was conceived by the 2nd Battalion , 3rd Marines ( 2/3 ) of the U.S. Marine Corps based on an operational model developed by 2/3 's sister battalion , the 3rd Battalion , 3rd Marines ( 3/3 ) , which had preceded the 2nd Battalion in their combat deployment . It utilized special operations forces ( SOF ) units and assets , including members of the U.S. Navy SEALs and the U.S. Army Special Operations Command 's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment ( Airborne ) ( SOAR ( A ) ) , for the opening phase of the operation . A team of four Navy SEALs , tasked for surveillance and reconnaissance of a group of structures known to be used by Shah and his men , fell into an ambush by Shah and his group just hours after inserting into the area by Fast-roping from an MH-47 helicopter . Three of the four SEALs were killed , and a quick reaction force helicopter sent in for their aid was shot down with a rocket-propelled grenade fired from an RPG-7 , killing all eight U.S. Navy SEALs and all eight U.S. Army Special Operations aviators on board . The operation then became known as Red Wings II and lasted approximately three more weeks , during which time the bodies of the deceased SEALs and Army Special Operations aviators were recovered and the only surviving member of the initial team , Marcus Luttrell , was rescued . While the goal of the operation was partially achieved , Shah regrouped in Pakistan and returned with more men and armament , aided by the notoriety he gained from the Red Wings ambush and helicopter shootdown . Several weeks later , Shah 's group in Kunar Province was stricken to a point of inoperability and Shah was seriously wounded , during Operation Whalers in August 2005 . In April 2008 , Shah was killed during a shootout with Pakistani police in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa .",
  "/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001\u2013present)": "The War in Afghanistan ( also called the US War in Afghanistan , Afghanistan War , or Fourth Anglo-Afghan War ) , code named Operation Enduring Freedom ( 2001-14 ) and Operation Freedom 's Sentinel ( 2015-present ) , following the United States invasion of Afghanistan of 7 October 2001 , when the United States of America and its allies successfully drove the Taliban from power in order to deny al-Qaeda a safe base of operations in Afghanistan . Since the initial objectives were completed , a coalition of over 40 countries ( including all NATO members ) formed a security mission in the country . The war has since mostly involved US and allied Afghan government troops battling Taliban insurgents . The war in Afghanistan is the longest war in US history . Following the September 11 attacks in 2001 on the US , which President George W. Bush blamed on Osama bin Laden who was living or hiding in Afghanistan and had already been wanted since 1998 , President Bush demanded that the Taliban , who were de facto ruling the country , hand over bin Laden . The Taliban declined to extradite him unless they were provided clear evidence of his involvement in the attacks , which the US refused to provide and dismissed as a delaying tactic and then on 7 October 2001 launched Operation Enduring Freedom with the United Kingdom . To justify the War , the Bush administration claimed that Afghanistan only had selective sovereignty , and that intervention was necessary because the Taliban threatened the sovereignty of other states . The two were later joined by other forces , including the Northern Alliance - the Afghan opposition which had been fighting the Taliban in the ongoing civil war since 1996 . By December 2001 , the Taliban and their al-Qaeda allies were mostly defeated in the country , and at the Bonn Conference new Afghan interim authorities ( mostly from the Northern Alliance ) elected Hamid Karzai to head the Afghan Interim Administration . The United Nations Security Council established the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) to assist the new authority with securing Kabul , which after a 2002 loya jirga ( grand assembly ) became the Afghan Transitional Administration . A nationwide rebuilding effort was also made following the end of the totalitarian Taliban regime . In the popular elections of 2004 , Karzai was elected president of the country , now named the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan .",

  "/wiki/Iraq_War": "The Iraq War [ nb 1 ] was a protracted armed conflict that began in 2003 with the invasion of Iraq by a United States-led coalition that overthrew the government of Saddam Hussein . The conflict continued for much of the next decade as an insurgency emerged to oppose the occupying forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government . An estimated 151,000 to 600,000 Iraqis were killed in the first three to four years of conflict . US troops were officially withdrawn in 2009 but are still fighting in Iraq , most of them having been redeployed following the spread of the Syrian Civil War and the territorial gains of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant . Many former soldiers are employed by defence contractors and private military companies . The U.S. became re-involved in 2014 at the head of a new coalition ; the insurgency and many dimensions of the civil armed conflict continue . The invasion occurred as part of the George W. Bush administration 's War on Terror , following the September 11 attacks . In October 2002 , Congress authorized President Bush to use military force against Iraq should he choose to . The Iraq War began on 20 March 2003 , when the U.S. , joined by the U.K. and several coalition allies , launched a shock and awe bombing campaign . Iraqi forces were quickly overwhelmed as U.S.-led forces swept through the country . The invasion led to the collapse of the Ba'athist government ; Saddam Hussein was captured during Operation Red Dawn in December of that same year and executed three years later . The power vacuum following Saddam 's demise and the mismanagement of the Coalition Provisional Authority led to widespread civil war between Shias and Sunnis , as well as a lengthy insurgency against coalition forces .",
