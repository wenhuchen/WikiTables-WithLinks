Born and raised in La Goulette , a neighbourhood of Tunis , Cardinale won the Most Beautiful Italian Girl in Tunisia competition in 1957 , the prize being a trip to Italy , which quickly led to film contracts , due above all to the involvement of Franco Cristaldi , who acted as her mentor for a number of years and later married her . After making her debut in a minor role with Omar Sharif in Goha ( 1958 ) , Cardinale became one of the best-known actresses in Italy after roles in films such as Rocco and His Brothers ( 1960 ) , Girl with a Suitcase ( 1961 ) , Cartouche ( 1962 ) , The Leopard ( 1963 ) , and Fellini 's 8\u00bd ( 1963 ) .

  "/wiki/Black_Sabbath_(film)": "Black Sabbath ( Italian : I tre volti della paura , lit . 'The Three Faces of Fear ' ) is a 1963 horror anthology film directed by Mario Bava . The film is centered on three separate tales that are introduced by Boris Karloff . The first , titled The Telephone , involves Rosy ( Mich\u00e8le Mercier ) who continually receives threatening telephone calls from an unseen stalker . The second is The Wurdulak , where a man named Gorca ( Karloff ) returns to his family after claiming to have slain a Wurdulak , an undead creature who attacks those that it had once loved . The third story , The Drop of Water , is centered on Helen Corey ( Jacqueline Pierreux ) , a nurse who steals a ring from a corpse that is being prepared for burial and finds herself haunted by the ring 's original owner after arriving home . Being a low-budget horror film with multiple stories , an international cast and foreign financial backing , Black Sabbath follows numerous trends of 1960s Italian film productions . The film is credited to various writers , but is predominantly based on several uncredited sources , and changes were made to the script after filming commenced . American International Pictures and Titra Sound Corporation suggested changes to Bava during filming to make the film palatable for American audiences , and created their own English-language version of the film , which replaced Roberto Nicolosi 's score with music by Les Baxter , removed several depictions of graphic violence and made alterations to other scenes . This version greatly changed the plot of The Telephone , giving it a supernatural element and removing all references to lesbianism and prostitution . Black Sabbath was a commercial failure upon release in Italy , and performed below expectations in America . A spiritual sequel to the film , based on The Dunwich Horror and provisionally titled Scarlet Friday , was set to reunite Bava with Karloff and co-star Christopher Lee , but AIP distanced themselves from Bava following the failure of Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs and eventually produced the film without Bava , Karloff or Lee 's involvement .",
  "/wiki/Mario_Bava": "Mario Bava ( 31 July 1914 - 27 April 1980 ) was an Italian filmmaker who worked variously as a director , screenwriter , cinematographer , and special effects artist . He is frequently referred to as the Master of Italian Horror and the Master of the Macabre . His low-budget genre films , known for their distinctive visual flair and stylish technical ingenuity , feature recurring themes and imagery concerning the conflict between illusion and reality , and the destructive capacity of human nature . Born to sculptor , cinematographer and special effects pioneer Eugenio Bava , the younger Bava followed his father into the film industry , and eventually earned a reputation as one of Italy 's foremost cameramen , lighting and providing the special effects for such films as Hercules ( 1958 ) and its sequel Hercules Unchained ( 1959 ) ( each were lampooned on Mystery Science Theater 3000 ) . During the late 1950s , his eventual career trajectory as a director began when he was relied upon to complete projects begun by or credited to his colleague Riccardo Freda and other filmmakers , including I Vampiri ( 1957 ) ( the first Italian horror film of the sound era ) , The Day the Sky Exploded ( 1958 ) ( the first Italian science fiction film ) , Caltiki - The Immortal Monster ( 1959 ) and The Giant of Marathon ( 1959 ) . Although most of Bava 's films as director failed to achieve major commercial success upon release , many of them would eventually find acclaim as cult classics , with their content and production values being favourably compared to the works of Alfred Hitchcock . Several of them have been noted for their revolutionary impact on their respective genres : Black Sunday ( 1960 ) , his official directorial debut , was the forerunner of the Italian gothic horror film cycle ; The Girl Who Knew Too Much ( 1963 ) is considered to be the first giallo film ; Kill , Baby , Kill ( 1966 ) heavily influenced the iconography of modern J-Horror ; Roy Colt & Winchester Jack ( 1970 ) is regarded as one of the earliest self-parodying Spaghetti Westerns ; Four Times That Night ( 1971 ) was an early Italian sex comedy ; and A Bay of Blood ( 1971 ) was a precursor to slasher films . His other notable films include Hercules in the Haunted World ( 1961 ) , Erik the Conqueror ( 1961 ) , Black Sabbath ( 1963 ) , The Whip and the Body ( 1963 ) , Blood and Black Lace ( 1964 ) , Planet of the Vampires ( 1965 ) , Knives of the Avenger ( 1966 ) , Danger : Diabolik ( 1968 ) , Hatchet for the Honeymoon ( 1970 ) , Five Dolls for an August Moon ( 1970 ) , Baron Blood ( 1972 ) , Lisa and the Devil ( 1974 ) , Rabid Dogs ( 1974 ) and Shock ( 1977 ) . Despite his reputation as a talented artist during his lifetime , Bava 's shy , self-deprecating demeanour prevented him from taking advantage of opportunities that would have furthered his international standing within the film industry , and he turned down multiple opportunities to work in Hollywood . Among the filmmakers Bava and his work have influenced include Dario Argento , Lucio Fulci , Federico Fellini , John Carpenter , Nicolas Winding Refn , Martin Scorsese , Tim Burton , Joe Dante , John Landis , Francis Ford Coppola , Roger Corman , Edgar Wright , Jennifer Kent and Quentin Tarantino .

In response , he and like-minded critics began to make their own films . Many of Godard 's films challenge the conventions of traditional Hollywood in addition to French cinema . In 1964 , Godard described his and his colleagues ' impact : We barged into the cinema like cavemen into the Versailles of Louis XV . He is often considered the most radical French filmmaker of the 1960s and 1970s ; his approach in film conventions , politics and philosophies made him arguably the most influential director of the French New Wave .
