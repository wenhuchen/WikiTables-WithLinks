It is one of the oldest domestic structures in Georgia and is a relatively intact example of a typical architectural genre which flourished in coastal Georgia and South Carolina in the eighteenth century .

Francis Henry Harris ( 1740-1782 ) , prominent figures of the Colonial and Revolutionary eras in Georgia , and the operation through two hundred years as a working rice plantation , owned for much of that time by descendants of the same family . The house was built on a five-hundred acre tract of land granted to Captain David Cutler Braddock in 1747 . Braddock , allowed to be an excellent seaman , according to the loyal Governor 's Council President , James Habersham in 1750 most likely constructed the house between 1752 and 1756 when Braddock was loaned a large sum of money by Francis Harris . The wainscoting , chimneys , and mantels along with its double spraddle roof are all suggestive of an eighteenth-century construction date . Francis Harris , an English-born accountant , came to Georgia about 1739 to assist Thomas Causton with the trustee accounts . In 1744 , Harris became a partner with James Habersham in the commercial firm of Harris and Habersham . Harris was a member of the Royal Governor 's Council and the first Speaker of the House of Commons in colonial Georgia .

Harris abandoned the mercantile trade and became a planter acquiring land on the Little Ogeechee River . He paid 1168 pounds for Braddock 's tract , the high price indicating the presence of a house on the property , and the English name was transferred to the American land .",
