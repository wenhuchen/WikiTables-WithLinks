  "/wiki/Brooke_Site": "The Brooke Site ( designated 33DE3 ) is an archaeological site in the northwestern portion of the U.S. state of Ohio . Located south of the city of Defiance in Defiance County , the site encompasses approximately 1 acre ( 0.40 ha ) at the bottom of a ravine , along the Auglaize River . It was occupied by Late Woodland peoples of the Ontario and Younge Traditions . Archaeology students from Defiance College took part in field schools at the site during the summers of 1968 through 1973 . Excavations conducted by these field schools resulted in the discovery of a wide range of artifacts , such as bits of flint , bone , and pottery , a midden , fire pits , and a piece of copper . Although only half of the site was excavated by these field schools , the knowledge gained was significant because it highlighted the connection between the different peoples who occupied the site , and because the excavations revealed the inhabitants ' varying seasonal uses of the site . In 1976 , the Brooke Site was added to the National Register of Historic Places because of its archaeological significance .",

  "/wiki/Fort_Defiance_(Ohio)": "Fort Defiance was built by General Mad Anthony Wayne in the second week of August 1794 at the confluence of the Auglaize and Maumee rivers . It was the one of a line of defenses constructed by American forces in the campaign leading to the Northwest Indian War 's Battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20 , 1794 . Work began on August 9 , 1794 and was completed by August 17 . The name was derived from a declaration by Charles Scott , who was leading a band of Kentucky militiamen in support of Wayne , that : I defy the English , Indians , and all the devils of hell to take it . The post was considered one of the strongest fortifications built in that period . Following the Battle of Fallen Timbers , Wayne ordered the destruction of all Native American villages and their crops within a 50-mile ( 80 km ) radius of the fort . Under terms of the Treaty of Greenville , signed on August 3 , 1795 , the native nations ceded six square miles around the fort and allowed the Americans to maintain a trading post there , even though it was within the area of land defined by the Greenville Treaty Line , beyond which Americans had agreed not to settle . The fort was abandoned in 1796 . Fort Winchester was constructed on a nearby site in 1812 by Gen. William Henry Harrison . The city of Defiance , Ohio , was founded at the fort 's location in 1822 . In 1904 , the site of the fort was chosen for the Defiance Public Library .
