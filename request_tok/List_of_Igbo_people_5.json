Born in the West Indies , he joined the free black immigrants from the United States who migrated to the region . He taught for five years in the British West African Colony of Sierra Leone in the early 20th century . His writings on pan-Africanism were influential in both colonies . These were founded during the slavery years for the resettlement of free blacks from Great Britain and the United States . Blyden 's writings attracted attention in the sponsoring countries as well . He believed that Zionism was a model for what he called Ethiopianism , and that African Americans could return to Africa and redeem it . He believed political independence to be a prerequisite for economic independence , and argued that Africans must counter the neo-colonial policies of former colonial powers . Blyden was recognised in his youth for his talents and drive ; he was educated and mentored by John Knox , an American Protestant minister in St Thomas , Danish West Indies , who encouraged him to continue his education in the United States .

  "/wiki/Americo-Liberian": "Americo-Liberian people , or Congo people or Congau people in Liberian English , are a Liberian ethnic group of African American , Afro-Caribbean and Liberated African descent . The sister ethnic group of Americo-Liberians are the Sierra Leone Creole people , who shared similar ancestry and related culture . Americo-Liberians trace their ancestry to free-born and formerly enslaved African Americans who emigrated in the 19th century to become the founders of the state of Liberia . They identified there as Americo-Liberians . Some African Americans following resettlement in Canada also participated as founding settlers in Sierra Leone and other Recaptive repatriates settled in present-day C\u00f4te d'Ivoire . Although the terms Americo-Liberian and Congo had distinct definitions in the nineteenth century , they are currently interchangeable and refer to an ethnic group composed of the descendants of the various free and ex-slave African American , Caribbean , Recaptive , and Sierra Leone Creoles who settled in Liberia from 1822 . The designation 'Congo ' for the Americo-Liberian population came into common usage when these African Americans integrated 5,000 liberated Africans called Congos ( former slaves from the Congo Basin , who were freed by British and Americans from slave ships after the prohibition of the African slave trade ) and 500 Barbadian immigrants into the Americo-Liberian hegemony . Americo-Liberians rarely intermarried with indigenous West Africans . Although Western literature and discourse in the United States and United Kingdom use the term Americo-Liberians , this term is outdated and in common parlance the majority of Liberians ( including the Americo-Liberian people themselves ) and neighbouring West Africans such as Sierra Leoneans refer to the Americo-Liberian people as Congo or Congau people . Upper-class Americo-Liberians and their descendants led the political , social , cultural and economic sectors of the country ; they ruled the new nation from 19th century until 1980 as a small but dominant minority . From 1878 to 1980 , the Republic of Liberia was a de facto one-party state , ruled by both the indigenous and Americo-Liberian-dominated True Whig Party and Masonic Order of Liberia .",
