  "/wiki/Douglas_MacArthur": "General of the Army Douglas MacArthur ( 26 January 1880 - 5 April 1964 ) was an American five-star general and Field Marshal of the Philippine Army . He was Chief of Staff of the United States Army during the 1930s and played a prominent role in the Pacific theater during World War II . He received the Medal of Honor for his service in the Philippines Campaign , which made him and his father Arthur MacArthur Jr. the first father and son to be awarded the medal . He was one of only five to rise to the rank of General of the Army in the US Army , and the only one conferred the rank of field marshal in the Philippine Army . Raised in a military family in the American Old West , MacArthur was valedictorian at the West Texas Military Academy where he finished high school , and First Captain at the United States Military Academy at West Point , where he graduated top of the class of 1903 . During the 1914 United States occupation of Veracruz , he conducted a reconnaissance mission , for which he was nominated for the Medal of Honor . In 1917 , he was promoted from major to colonel and became chief of staff of the 42nd ( Rainbow ) Division . In the fighting on the Western Front during World War I , he rose to the rank of brigadier general , was again nominated for a Medal of Honor , and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross twice and the Silver Star seven times . From 1919 to 1922 , MacArthur served as Superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point , where he attempted a series of reforms . His next assignment was in the Philippines , where in 1924 he was instrumental in quelling the Philippine Scout Mutiny . In 1925 , he became the Army 's youngest major general . He served on the court-martial of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell and was president of the American Olympic Committee during the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam .",
  "/wiki/General_of_the_Army_(United_States)": "General of the Army ( abbreviated as GA ) is a five-star general officer and the second highest possible rank in the United States Army . A General of the Army ranks immediately above a general and is equivalent to a fleet admiral and a General of the Air Force . The General of the Army insignia consisted of five 3/8th inch stars in a pentagonal pattern , with points touching . The insignia was paired with the gold and enameled United States Coat of Arms on service coat shoulder loops . The silver colored five-star metal insignia alone would be worn for use as a collar insignia of grade and on the garrison cap . Soft shoulder epaulettes with five 7/16th inch stars in silver thread and gold-threaded United States Coat of Arms on green cloth were worn with shirts and sweaters . The rank of General of the Army has had two incarnations . The rank was introduced in 1866 , the year after the American Civil War . It was reserved for the Commanding General of the United States Army , was a four-star rank , and was held by three different individuals from 1866 to 1888 . The rank was revived as the modern five-star rank during World War II , and may be awarded to more than one serving officer at a time . It was held by five different individuals from 1944 to 1981 . A special rank of General of the Armies , which ranks above General of the Army , exists but has been conferred only twice , to World War I 's John J. Pershing , and posthumously to George Washington , by proclamation 177 years after his death .",

Pershing of the United States against German positions . The U.S. Army Air Service played a significant role in this action . This battle marked the first use of the terms D-Day and H-Hour by the Americans . The attack at the Saint-Mihiel salient was part of a plan by Pershing in which he hoped that the Americans would break through the German lines and capture the fortified city of Metz . It was the first and only offensive launched mainly by the United States Army in World War I , and the attack caught the Germans in the process of retreating . This meant that their artillery was out of place and the American attack , coming up against disorganized German forces , proved more successful than expected . The Saint-Mihiel attack established the stature of the U.S. Army in the eyes of the French and British forces , and again demonstrated the critical role of artillery during World War I and the difficulty of supplying such massive armies while they were on the move . The U.S. attack faltered as artillery and food supplies were left behind on the muddy roads . The attack on Metz was not realized , as the Supreme Allied Commander Ferdinand Foch ordered the American troops to march towards Sedan and M\u00e9zi\u00e8res , which would lead to the Meuse-Argonne Offensive .",

The Meuse-Argonne offensive was the largest in United States military history , involving 1.2 million American soldiers . It is the second deadliest battle in American history , resulting in over 350,000 casualties including 28,000 German lives , 26,277 American lives and an unknown number of French lives . U.S. losses were worsened by the inexperience of many of the troops , the tactics used during the early phases of the operation and the widespread onset of the global influenza outbreak called the Spanish Flu . Meuse-Argonne was the principal engagement of the American Expeditionary Force ( AEF ) during World War I . It was one of a series of Allied attacks known as the Hundred Days Offensive , which brought the war to an end . It was the largest and bloodiest operation of World War I for the AEF even if , given the scale of other battles on the Western Front , its size was limited and the operation itself secondary as it was far from the main offensive axis .",
  "/wiki/World_War_I": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",

Many Superintendents later became Commanding Generals , such as Joseph Gardner Swift . The post is now a terminal assignment in the Army ; as a condition for detail to the position , officers are required by law to acknowledge that they will retire at the end of their appointment . This formulation was meant to secure the independence of Superintendents from unlawful command influence ; however , in practice the resulting lame duck status restricts their power and influence in the Army .

The 34th Infantry was detached from the 8th Infantry Division and moved to a port of embarkation in December 1941 , along with two battalions of 105mm field artillery . The Philippine Division was to have two complete U.S. regimental combat teams in place by January 1942 to provide General Douglas MacArthur with a modern , trained mobile reaction force , while freeing up Philippine Scouts for rounding out other units . The outbreak of war in December 1941 , however , isolated the Philippines and prevented implementation of the plan . It was briefly reconstituted as the 12th Infantry Division in 1944-45 .",

The battle represented the most intense phase of the Japanese invasion of the Philippines during World War II . In January 1942 , forces of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy invaded Luzon along with several islands in the Philippine Archipelago after the bombing of the American naval base at Pearl Harbor . The commander-in-chief of all U.S. and Filipino forces in the islands , General Douglas MacArthur , consolidated all of his Luzon-based units on the Bataan Peninsula to fight against the Japanese army . By this time , the Japanese controlled nearly all of Southeast Asia . The Bataan Peninsula and the island of Corregidor were the only remaining Allied strongholds in the region . Despite a lack of supplies , American and Filipino forces managed to fight the Japanese for three months , engaging them initially in a fighting retreat southward . As the combined American and Filipino forces made a last stand , the delay cost the Japanese valuable time and prevented immediate victory across the Pacific . The American surrender at Bataan to the Japanese , with 76,000 soldiers surrendering in the Philippines altogether , was the largest in American and Filipino military histories , and was the largest United States surrender since the American Civil War 's Battle of Harper 's Ferry .

A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war .

In Japan , the position was generally referred to as GHQ ( General Headquarters ) , as SCAP also referred to the offices of the occupation , including a staff of several hundred US civil servants as well as military personnel . Some of these personnel effectively wrote a first draft of the Japanese Constitution , which the National Diet then ratified after a few amendments . Australian , British , Indian , and New Zealand forces under SCAP were organized into a sub-command known as British Commonwealth Occupation Force . These actions led MacArthur to be viewed as the new Imperial force in Japan by many Japanese political and civilian figures , even being considered to be the rebirth of the sh\u014dgun-style government:341 which Japan was ruled under until the start of the Meiji Restoration .

The wartime cabinet was replaced with a cabinet acceptable to the Allies and committed to implementing the terms of the Potsdam Declaration , which among other things called for the country to become a parliamentary democracy . Under MacArthur 's guidance , the Japanese government introduced sweeping social reforms and implemented economic reforms that recalled American New Deal priorities of the 1930s under President Roosevelt . The Japanese constitution was comprehensively overhauled and the Emperor 's theoretically-vast powers , which for many centuries had been constrained by conventions that had evolved over time , became strictly limited by law . The occupation , codenamed Operation Blacklist , was ended by the San Francisco Peace Treaty , signed on September 8 , 1951 , and effective from April 28 , 1952 , after which Japan 's sovereignty - with the exception , until 1972 , of the Ryukyu Islands - was fully restored .

The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea . At the end of World War II , the Soviet Union and the United States liberated Korea from imperial Japanese colonial control on 15 August 1945 . After the war had ended , Korea was divided at the 38th parallel into two zones of occupation , the Soviets administered the northern half and the Americans administered the southern half . With the border set at the 38th parallel in 1948 , two sovereign states were established as a result of geopolitical tensions of the Cold War ( between the Soviet Union and the United States ) . A socialist state was established in the north under the communist leadership of Kim Il-sung and a capitalist state in the south under the anti-communist leadership of Syngman Rhee . Both governments of the two new Korean states claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea , and neither accepted the border as permanent . The conflict escalated into warfare when North Korean military ( KPA ) forces - supported by the Soviet Union and China - crossed the border and advanced into South Korea on 25 June 1950 . The United Nations Security Council authorized the formation of the United Nations Command and the dispatch of forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion . Twenty-one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the UN force , with the United States providing around 90% of the military personnel .

Belligerents hold prisoners of war in custody for a range of legitimate and illegitimate reasons , such as isolating them from enemy combatants still in the field ( releasing and repatriating them in an orderly manner after hostilities ) , demonstrating military victory , punishing them , prosecuting them for war crimes , exploiting them for their labour , recruiting or even conscripting them as their own combatants , collecting military and political intelligence from them , or indoctrinating them in new political or religious beliefs .",
  "/wiki/USS_Missouri_(BB-63)": "USS Missouri ( BB-63 ) ( Mighty Mo or Big Mo ) is an Iowa-class battleship and was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named after the U.S. state of Missouri . Missouri was the last battleship commissioned by the United States and is best remembered as the site of the surrender of the Empire of Japan , which ended World War II . Missouri was ordered in 1940 and commissioned in June 1944 . In the Pacific Theater of World War II she fought in the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa and shelled the Japanese home islands , and she fought in the Korean War from 1950 to 1953 . She was decommissioned in 1955 into the United States Navy reserve fleets ( the Mothball Fleet ) , but reactivated and modernized in 1984 as part of the 600-ship Navy plan , and provided fire support during Operation Desert Storm in January/February 1991 . Missouri received a total of 11 battle stars for service in World War II , Korea , and the Persian Gulf , and was finally decommissioned on 31 March 1992 after serving a total of 17 years of active service , but remained on the Naval Vessel Register until her name was struck in January 1995 . In 1998 , she was donated to the USS Missouri Memorial Association and became a museum ship at Pearl Harbor .",

  "/wiki/Brigadier_general": "Brigadier general ( Brig . Gen. ) or brigade general is a senior rank in the armed forces . It is the lowest ranking general officer in some countries , usually sitting between the ranks of colonel and major general . When appointed to a field command , a brigadier general is typically in command of a brigade consisting of around 4,000 troops ( four battalions ) . In some countries a brigadier general is informally designated as a one-star general ( OF-6 ) . In some countries , this rank is given the name of brigadier , which is usually equivalent to brigadier general in the armies of nations that use the rank . The rank can be traced back to the militaries of Europe where a brigadier general , or simply a brigadier , would command a brigade in the field . The rank name g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de brigade ( which translates as brigade general ) was first used in the French revolutionary armies . In the first quarter of the 20th century , British and Commonwealth armies used the rank of brigadier general as a temporary appointment , or as an honorary appointment on retirement ; in the 1920s this practice changed to the use of brigadier , which was not classed as a general officer . Some armies , such as Taiwan and Japan , use major general as the equivalent of brigadier general ( See also Japan & Taiwan for details. ) . Some of these armies then use the rank of colonel general to make four general-officer ranks . [ citation needed ] Mexico uses the ranks of both General brigadier and General de brigada .",
  "/wiki/Operation_Torch": "Operation Torch ( 8-16 November 1942 ) was an Anglo-American invasion of French North Africa during the Second World War . The French colonies in the area were dominated by the Vichy French , formally aligned with Germany but of mixed loyalties . Reports indicated that they might support the Allies . The American General Dwight D. Eisenhower , commanding the operation , planned a three-pronged attack on Casablanca ( Western ) , Oran ( Center ) and Algiers ( Eastern ) , then a rapid move on Tunis . The Western Task Force encountered unexpected resistance and bad weather , but Casablanca , the principal French Atlantic naval base , was captured after a short siege . The Center Task Force suffered some damage to its ships when trying to land in shallow water but the Vichy French ships were sunk or driven off ; Oran surrendered after bombardment by British battleships . The Eastern Task Force met less opposition because the French Resistance had staged a coup in Algiers and the Allies were able to push inland and compel surrender on the first day . The success of Torch caused Admiral Fran\u00e7ois Darlan , commander of the Vichy French forces to order co-operation with the Allies , in return for being retained as High Commissioner , with many other Vichy officials keeping their jobs . Darlan was assassinated soon after and the Free French gradually came to dominate the government .

  "/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Forces": "The United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF or AAF ) was the aerial warfare service component of the United States Army , and de facto aerial warfare service branch of the United States , during and immediately after World War II ( 1939/41-1945 ) , successor to the previous United States Army Air Corps , and the direct predecessor of the United States Air Force of today , one of the five uniformed military services . The AAF was a component of the United States Army , which on 2 March 1942 was divided functionally by executive order into three autonomous forces : the Army Ground Forces , the Services of Supply ( which in 1943 became the Army Service Forces ) , and the Army Air Forces . Each of these forces had a commanding general who reported directly to the Army Chief of Staff . The AAF administered all parts of military aviation formerly distributed among the Air Corps , General Headquarters Air Force , and the ground forces ' corps area commanders , and thus became the first air organization of the U.S. Army to control its own installations and support personnel . The peak size of the AAF during the Second World War was over 2.4 million men and women in service and nearly 80,000 aircraft by 1944 , and 783 domestic bases in December 1943 . By V-E Day , the Army Air Forces had 1.25 million men stationed overseas and operated from more than 1,600 airfields worldwide . The Army Air Forces was created in June 1941 to provide the air arm a greater autonomy in which to expand more efficiently , to provide a structure for the additional command echelons required by a vastly increased force , and to end an increasingly divisive administrative battle within the Army over control of aviation doctrine and organization that had been ongoing since the creation of an aviation section within the U.S. Army Signal Corps in 1914 . The AAF succeeded both the Air Corps , which had been the statutory military aviation branch since 1926 , and the GHQ Air Force , which had been activated in 1935 to quiet the demands of airmen for an independent Air Force similar to the Royal Air Force which had already been established in the United Kingdom . Although other nations already had separate air forces independent of their army or navy ( such as the British Royal Air Force and the German Luftwaffe ) , the AAF remained a part of the Army until a defense reorganization in the post-war period resulted in the passage by the United States Congress of the National Security Act of 1947 with the creation of an independent United States Air Force in September 1947 . In its expansion and conduct of the war , the AAF became more than just an arm of the greater organization . By the end of World War II , the Army Air Forces had become virtually an independent service . By regulation and executive order , it was a subordinate agency of the United States Department of War ( as were the Army Ground Forces and the Army Service Forces ) tasked only with organizing , training , and equipping combat units , and limited in responsibility to the continental United States .",

  "/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Corps": "The United States Army Air Corps ( USAAC ) was the aerial warfare service component of the United States Army between 1926 and 1941 . After World War I , as early aviation became an increasingly important part of modern warfare , a philosophical rift developed between more traditional ground-based army personnel and those who felt that aircraft were being underutilized and that air operations were being stifled for political reasons unrelated to their effectiveness . The USAAC was renamed from the earlier United States Army Air Service on 2 July 1926 , and was part of the larger United States Army . The Air Corps became the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) on 20 June 1941 , giving it greater autonomy from the Army 's middle-level command structure . During World War II , although not an administrative echelon , the Air Corps ( AC ) remained as one of the combat arms of the Army until 1947 , when it was legally abolished by legislation establishing the Department of the Air Force . The Air Corps was renamed by the United States Congress largely as a compromise between the advocates of a separate air arm and those of the traditionalist Army high command who viewed the aviation arm as an auxiliary branch to support the ground forces . Although its members worked to promote the concept of air power and an autonomous air force in the years between the world wars , its primary purpose by Army policy remained support of ground forces rather than independent operations . On 1 March 1935 , still struggling with the issue of a separate air arm , the Army activated the General Headquarters Air Force for centralized control of aviation combat units within the continental United States , separate from but coordinate with the Air Corps . The separation of the Air Corps from control of its combat units caused problems of unity of command that became more acute as the Air Corps enlarged in preparation for World War II . This was resolved by the creation of the Army Air Forces ( AAF ) , making both organizations subordinate to the new higher echelon . On June 20 , 1941 , the Army Air Corps ' existence as the primary air arm of the U.S. Army changed to that of solely being the training and logistics elements of the then-new United States Army Air Forces , which embraced the formerly-named General Headquarters Air Force under the new Air Force Combat Command organization for front-line combat operations ; this new element , along with the Air Corps , comprised the USAAF . The Air Corps ceased to have an administrative structure after 9 March 1942 , but as the permanent statutory organization of the air arm , and the principal component of the Army Air Forces , the overwhelming majority of personnel assigned to the AAF were members of the Air Corps .",

A 1,200-plane airborne assault preceded an amphibious assault involving more than 5,000 vessels . Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the English Channel on 6 June , and more than two million Allied troops were in France by the end of August . The decision to undertake a cross-channel invasion in 1944 was taken at the Trident Conference in Washington in May 1943 . General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed commander of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force ( SHAEF ) , and General Bernard Montgomery was named as commander of the 21st Army Group , which comprised all the land forces involved in the invasion . The coast of Normandy of northwestern France was chosen as the site of the invasion , with the Americans assigned to land at sectors codenamed Utah and Omaha , the British at Sword and Gold , and the Canadians at Juno . To meet the conditions expected on the Normandy beachhead , special technology was developed , including two artificial ports called Mulberry harbours and an array of specialised tanks nicknamed Hobart 's Funnies .
