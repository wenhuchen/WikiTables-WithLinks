  "/wiki/Another_World_(video_game)": "Another World , [ a ] known as Out of This World in North America , is a 1991 cinematic platformer action-adventure game designed by \u00c9ric Chahi and published by Delphine Software . The game tells a story of Lester , a young scientist who , as a result of an experiment gone wrong , finds himself on a dangerous alien world where he is forced to fight for his survival . Another World was developed by Chahi alone over a period of about two years , with only help with the soundtrack from Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Freitas . Chahi developed his own game engine , completing all the game 's art and animations in vector form to reduce memory use , with some use of rotoscoping to help plan out character movements . Both narratively and gameplay-wise , he wanted the game to be told with little to no language or user-interface elements . The game was originally developed for the Amiga and Atari ST but has since been widely ported to other contemporary systems , including home and portable consoles and mobile devices . Chahi has since overseen release of various anniversary releases of the game . Another World was innovative in its use of cinematic effects in both real-time and cutscenes , which earned the game praise among critics and commercial success . It also influenced a number of other video games and designers , inspiring such titles as Ico , Metal Gear Solid , Silent Hill , and Delphine 's later Flashback .",

Palace Software 's marketing strategy provoked controversy in the United Kingdom , with protests focused on the sexual aspects of the packaging rather than decapitations and other violence within the game . The ensuing controversy boosted Barbarian 's profile , helping to make it a commercial success . Game critics were impressed with its fast and furious combat , and dashes of humour .
