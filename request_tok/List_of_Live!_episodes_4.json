  "/wiki/Parkour": "Parkour ( French : [ pa\u0281ku\u0281 ] ) is a training discipline using movement that developed from military obstacle course training . Practitioners , called tracers or traceurs , aim to get from one point to another in a complex environment , without assistive equipment and in the fastest and most efficient way possible . Parkour includes running , climbing , swinging , vaulting , jumping , plyometrics , rolling , quadrupedal movement ( crawling ) and other movements as deemed most suitable for the situation ( not to be confused with freerunning ) . Parkour 's development from military training gives it some aspects of a non-combative martial art . Parkour is an activity that can be practiced alone or with others and is usually carried out in urban spaces , though it can be done anywhere . Parkour involves seeing one 's environment in a new way , and imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around , across , through , over and under its features . Parkour as a type of movement was established by David Belle in the late 1980s , therefore many consider its origin to be France , however this type of movement has also been practiced by people in other European countries like Latvia and Russia during the same period of time . [ citation needed ] The discipline was popularised in the late 1990s and 2000s through films , documentaries , video games and advertisements featuring the Yamakasi .",

  "/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation": "Cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) is an emergency procedure that combines chest compressions often with artificial ventilation in an effort to manually preserve intact brain function until further measures are taken to restore spontaneous blood circulation and breathing in a person who is in cardiac arrest . It is recommended in those who are unresponsive with no breathing or abnormal breathing , for example , agonal respirations . CPR involves chest compressions for adults between 5 cm ( 2.0 in ) and 6 cm ( 2.4 in ) deep and at a rate of at least 100 to 120 per minute . The rescuer may also provide artificial ventilation by either exhaling air into the subject 's mouth or nose ( mouth-to-mouth resuscitation ) or using a device that pushes air into the subject 's lungs ( mechanical ventilation ) . Current recommendations place emphasis on early and high-quality chest compressions over artificial ventilation ; a simplified CPR method involving chest compressions , is only recommended for untrained rescuers . In children , however , only doing compressions may result in worse outcomes , because in children the problem normally arises from a respiratory , rather than cardiac problem . Chest compression to breathing ratios is set at 30 to 2 in adults . CPR alone is unlikely to restart the heart . Its main purpose is to restore partial flow of oxygenated blood to the brain and heart . The objective is to delay tissue death and to extend the brief window of opportunity for a successful resuscitation without permanent brain damage . Administration of an electric shock to the subject 's heart , termed defibrillation , is usually needed in order to restore a viable or perfusing heart rhythm . Defibrillation is effective only for certain heart rhythms , namely ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia , rather than asystole or pulseless electrical activity .",

  "/wiki/American_football": "American football , referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron , [ nb 1 ] is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end . The offense , the team with possession of the oval-shaped football , attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it , while the defense , the team without possession of the ball , aims to stop the offense 's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves . The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays ; if they fail , they turn over the football to the defense , but if they succeed , they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive . Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins . American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of soccer and rugby . The first American football match was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the Father of American Football , established the snap , the line of scrimmage , eleven-player teams , and the concept of downs . Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game ( although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp 's ) . Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football . The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football .",
