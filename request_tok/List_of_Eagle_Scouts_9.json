Wright believed in designing structures that were in harmony with humanity and its environment , a philosophy he called organic architecture . This philosophy was best exemplified by Fallingwater ( 1935 ) , which has been called the best all-time work of American architecture . As a founder of organic architecture , Wright played a key role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century , influencing three generations of architects worldwide through his works . Wright was the pioneer of what came to be called the Prairie School movement of architecture , and he also developed the concept of the Usonian home in Broadacre City , his unique vision for urban planning in the United States . In addition to his houses , Wright designed original and innovative offices , churches , schools , skyscrapers , hotels , museums , and other structures . He often designed interior elements for these buildings , as well , including furniture and stained glass . Wright wrote 20 books and many articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and Europe . Wright was recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as the greatest American architect of all time . In 2019 , a selection of his work became a listed World Heritage Site as The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright . Raised in rural Wisconsin , Wright studied civil engineering at the University of Wisconsin and then apprenticed in Chicago with noted architects Joseph Lyman Silsbee and Louis Sullivan .

  "/wiki/Marine_Security_Guard": "A Marine Security Guard ( MSG ) , also known as a Marine Embassy Guard , is a member of the Marine Corps Embassy Security Group ( formerly Marine Security Guard Battalion ) , a battalion-sized organization of the United States Marine Corps ( USMC ) whose detachments provide security at American embassies , American consulates and other official United States Government offices such as the United States Mission to NATO in Brussels , Belgium . The Marine Security Guard was designated MOS 8151 , though this has changed to MOS 8156 . The USMC has a long history of cooperation with the U.S. State Department , going back to the early days of the country . From the raising of the American flag at Derna , Tripoli , and the secret mission of Archibald H. Gillespie in California , to the Boxer Rebellion at Peking , Marines have served many times on special missions as couriers , as guards for embassies and delegations , and to protect American citizens in unsettled areas . The formal and permanent use of Marines as security guards began with the Foreign Service Act of 1946 , which authorized the Secretary of Navy to , upon the request of the Secretary of State , assign Marines to serve as custodians under the supervision of the senior diplomatic officer at a diplomatic post . The first joint Memorandum of Agreement was signed on 15 December 1948 regarding the provisions of assigning Marines overseas . Trained at the Foreign Service Institute , the first Marines arrived at Tangier and Bangkok in early 1949 . The Marine Corps assumed the primary training responsibility in November 1954 . The authority granted in the Foreign Service Act of 1946 has since been replaced by 10 U.S.C . \u00a7 8183 and the most recent Memorandum of Agreement was signed in August 2008 . Although embassy duty is a crucial aspect of the Marines mission with a long tradition , the Corps is only budgeted to train and maintain a limited cadre of guards to cover over 100 embassies worldwide . In response to the 2012 Benghazi attack , Congress ordered a near doubling of Marine Security Guards in the midst of a post-war drawdown in overall USMC numbers .",

  "/wiki/Gay_rights_activism": "Lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT ) social movements are social movements that advocate for LGBT people in society . Social movements may focus on equal rights , such as the 2000s movement for marriage equality , or they may focus on liberation , as in the gay liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s . Earlier movements focused on self-help and self-acceptance , such as the homophile movement of the 1950s . Although there is not a primary or an overarching central organization that represents all LGBT people and their interests , numerous LGBT rights organizations are active worldwide . The earliest organizations to support LGBT rights were formed in the early 20th century . A commonly stated goal among these movements is social equality for LGBT people , but there is still denial of full LGBT rights . Some have also focused on building LGBT communities or worked towards liberation for the broader society from bi-phobia , homophobia , and trans-phobia . There is a struggle for LGBT rights today . LGBT movements organized today are made up of a wide range of political activism and cultural activity , including lobbying , street marches , social groups , media , art , and research ."
