  "/wiki/Operating_system": "An operating system ( OS ) is system software that manages computer hardware , software resources , and provides common services for computer programs . Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time , mass storage , printing , and other resources . For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation , the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware , although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it . Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer - from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers . The dominant desktop operating system is Microsoft Windows with a market share of around 82.74% . macOS by Apple Inc. is in second place ( 13.23% ) , and the varieties of Linux are collectively in third place ( 1.57% ) . In the mobile ( including smartphones and tablets ) sector , Google Android 's share is up to 70% in the year 2017 . According to third quarter 2016 data , Android 's share on smartphones is dominant with 87.5 percent with also a growth rate of 10.3 percent per year , followed by Apple 's iOS with 12.1 percent with per year decrease in market share of 5.2 percent , while other operating systems amount to just 0.3 percent . Linux distributions are dominant in the server and supercomputing sectors . Other specialized classes of operating systems , such as embedded and real-time systems , exist for many applications .",
  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",
  "/wiki/PlainTalk": "PlainTalk is the collective name for several speech synthesis ( MacinTalk ) and speech recognition technologies developed by Apple Inc . In 1990 , Apple invested a lot of work and money in speech recognition technology , hiring many researchers in the field . The result was PlainTalk , released with the AV models in the Macintosh Quadra series from 1993 . It was made a standard system component in System 7.1.2 , and has since been shipped on all PowerPC and some other 68k Macintoshes .",
  "/wiki/Macintosh": "The Macintosh ( mainly Mac since 1998 ) is a family of personal computers designed , manufactured , and sold by Apple Inc. since January 1984 . The original Macintosh is the first successful mass-market personal computer to have featured a graphical user interface , built-in screen , and mouse . Apple sold the Macintosh alongside its popular Apple II family of computers for almost ten years until the latter was discontinued in 1993 . Early Macintosh models were expensive , hindering competitiveness in a market dominated by the much cheaper Commodore 64 for consumers , as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses . Although they were less expensive than the Xerox Alto and other computers with graphical user interfaces that predated the Mac . Macintosh systems were successful in education and desktop publishing , making Apple the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade . In the early 1990s , Apple introduced the Macintosh LC II and Color Classic which were price-competitive with Wintel machines at the time . However , the introduction of Windows 3.1 and Intel 's Pentium processor which beat the Motorola 68040 in most benchmarks , gradually took market share from Apple , and by the end of 1994 Apple was relegated to third place as Compaq became the top PC manufacturer . Even after the transition to the superior PowerPC-based Power Macintosh line in the mid-1990s , the falling prices of commodity PC components , poor inventory management with the Macintosh Performa , and the release of Windows 95 contributed to some decline of the Macintosh user base . Upon his return , Steve Jobs led Apple to consolidate the complex line of nearly twenty Macintosh models in mid-1997 ( including models made for specific regions ) down to four in mid-1999 : the Power Macintosh G3 , iMac , 14.1 PowerBook G3 , and 12 iBook . All four products were critically and commercially successful due to their high performance , competitive prices and aesthetic designs , and helped return Apple to profitability . Around this time , Apple phased out the Macintosh name in favor of Mac , a nickname that had been in common use since the development of the first model .",

Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution . Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project . Many Linux distributions use the word Linux in their name , but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software , causing some controversy . Popular Linux distributions include Debian , Fedora , and Ubuntu . Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server . Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose . Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system . Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers ( since November 2017 , having gradually eliminated all competitors ) .

  "/wiki/Solaris_(operating_system)": "Solaris is a non-free Unix operating system originally developed by Sun Microsystems . It superseded the company 's earlier SunOS in 1993 . In 2010 , after the Sun acquisition by Oracle , it was renamed Oracle Solaris . Solaris is known for its scalability , especially on SPARC systems , and for originating many innovative features such as DTrace , ZFS and Time Slider . Solaris supports SPARC and x86-64 workstations and servers from Oracle and other vendors . Solaris is registered as compliant with the Single UNIX Specification . Historically , Solaris was developed as proprietary software . In June 2005 , Sun Microsystems released most of the codebase under the CDDL license , and founded the OpenSolaris open-source project . With OpenSolaris , Sun wanted to build a developer and user community around the software . After the acquisition of Sun Microsystems in January 2010 , Oracle decided to discontinue the OpenSolaris distribution and the development model . In August 2010 , Oracle discontinued providing public updates to the source code of the Solaris kernel , effectively turning Solaris 11 back into a closed source proprietary operating system . Following that , OpenSolaris was forked as illumos and is alive through several illumos distributions .",

  "/wiki/C_(programming_language)": "C ( /si\u02d0/ , as in the letter c ) is a general-purpose , procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming , lexical variable scope , and recursion , while a static type system prevents unintended operations . By design , C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions and has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language . Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computers , from supercomputers to embedded systems . C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to make utilities running on Unix . Later , it was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system . During the 1980s , C gradually gained popularity . It has become one of the most widely used programming languages , with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems . C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 ( see ANSI C ) and by the International Organization for Standardization . C is an imperative procedural language . It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions , all with minimal runtime support . Despite its low-level capabilities , the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming . A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code .",
  "/wiki/Embedded_Linux": "Operating systems based on the Linux kernel are used in embedded systems such as consumer electronics ( i.e . set-top boxes , smart TVs , personal video recorders ( PVRs ) , in-vehicle infotainment ( IVI ) , networking equipment ( such as routers , switches , wireless access points ( WAPs ) or wireless routers ) , machine control , industrial automation , navigation equipment , spacecraft flight software , and medical instruments in general ) . Thanks to their versatility , operating systems based on the Linux kernel can be also found in mobile devices that are actually touchscreen-based embedded devices , such as smartphones and tablets , together with personal digital assistants ( PDAs ) and portable media players that also include a touchscreen . This is a challenge for most learners because their computer experience is mainly based on GUI ( Graphical user interface ) based interaction with the machine and high-level programming on the one hand and low-level programming of small microcontrollers on the other hand while the concept of command line interfaces is widely unknown .",
  "/wiki/Android_(operating_system)": "Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software , designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets . Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance , with the main contributor and commercial marketer being Google .

The current stable version is Android 10 , released on September 3 , 2019 . The core Android source code is known as Android Open Source Project ( AOSP ) , which is primarily licensed under the Apache License . This has allowed variants of Android to be developed on a range of other electronics , such as game consoles , digital cameras , PCs and others , each with a specialized user interface . Some well known derivatives include Android TV for televisions and Wear OS for wearables , both developed by Google . Android 's source code has been used as the basis of different ecosystems , most notably that of Google which is associated with a suite of proprietary software called Google Mobile Services ( GMS ) , that frequently comes pre-installed on said devices . This includes core apps such as Gmail , the digital distribution platform Google Play and associated Google Play Services development platform , and usually apps such as the Google Chrome web browser . These apps are licensed by manufacturers of Android devices certified under standards imposed by Google . Other competing Android ecosystems include Amazon.com 's Fire OS , or LineageOS .

  "/wiki/IOS": "iOS ( formerly iPhone OS ) is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its hardware . It is the operating system that presently powers many of the company 's mobile devices , including the iPhone , and iPod Touch ; it also powered the iPad prior to the introduction of iPadOS in 2019 . It is the second most popular mobile operating system globally after Android . Originally unveiled in 2007 for the iPhone , iOS has been extended to support other Apple devices such as the iPod Touch ( September 2007 ) and the iPad ( January 2010 ) . As of March 2018 [ update ] , Apple 's App Store contains more than 2.1 million iOS applications , 1 million of which are native for iPads . These mobile apps have collectively been downloaded more than 130 billion times . The iOS user interface is based upon direct manipulation , using multi-touch gestures . Interface control elements consist of sliders , switches , and buttons . Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe , tap , pinch , and reverse pinch , all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface . Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device ( one common result is the undo command ) or rotating it in three dimensions ( one common result is switching between portrait and landscape mode ) . Apple has been significantly praised for incorporating thorough accessibility functions into iOS , enabling users with vision and hearing disabilities to properly use its products . Major versions of iOS are released annually .",
  "/wiki/Cloud_computing": "Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources , especially data storage and computing power , without direct active management by the user . The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet . Large clouds , predominant today , often have functions distributed over multiple locations from central servers . If the connection to the user is relatively close , it may be designated an edge server . Clouds may be limited to a single organization ( enterprise clouds ) , or be available to many organizations ( public cloud ) . Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale . Advocates of public and hybrid clouds note that cloud computing allows companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs . Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster , with improved manageability and less maintenance , and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand , providing the burst computing capability : high computing power at certain periods of peak demand . Cloud providers typically use a pay-as-you-go model , which can lead to unexpected operating expenses if administrators are not familiarized with cloud-pricing models . The availability of high-capacity networks , low-cost computers and storage devices as well as the widespread adoption of hardware virtualization , service-oriented architecture and autonomic and utility computing has led to growth in cloud computing . By 2019 , Linux was the most widely used operating system , including in Microsoft 's offerings and is thus described as dominant . The Cloud Service Provider ( CSP ) will screen , keep up and gather data about the firewalls , intrusion identification or/and counteractive action frameworks and information stream inside the network .",

The language has expanded significantly over time , and modern C++ has object-oriented , generic , and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation . It is almost always implemented as a compiled language , and many vendors provide C++ compilers , including the Free Software Foundation , LLVM , Microsoft , Intel , Oracle , and IBM , so it is available on many platforms . C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded , resource-constrained software and large systems , with performance , efficiency , and flexibility of use as its design highlights . C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts , with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications , including desktop applications , video games , servers ( e.g . e-commerce , Web search , or SQL servers ) , and performance-critical applications ( e.g . telephone switches or space probes ) . C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) , with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as ISO/IEC 14882:2017 ( informally known as C++17 ) . The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998 , which was then amended by the C++03 , C++11 and C++14 standards . The current C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library . Before the initial standardization in 1998 , C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language ; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization . C++20 is the next planned standard , keeping with the current trend of a new version every three years .",
  "/wiki/Java_(programming_language)": "Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based , object-oriented , and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible . It is intended to let application developers write once , run anywhere ( WORA ) , meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation . Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine ( JVM ) regardless of the underlying computer architecture . The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++ , but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them . As of 2019 [ update ] , Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub , particularly for client-server web applications , with a reported 9 million developers . Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems ( which has since been acquired by Oracle ) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems ' Java platform . The original and reference implementation Java compilers , virtual machines , and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses . As of May 2007 , in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process , Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License . Meanwhile , others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies , such as the GNU Compiler for Java ( bytecode compiler ) , GNU Classpath ( standard libraries ) , and IcedTea-Web ( browser plugin for applets ) . The latest versions are Java 13 , released in September 2019 , and Java 11 , a currently supported long-term support ( LTS ) version , released on September 25 , 2018 ; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use , while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020 . Oracle ( and others ) highly recommend uninstalling older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues . Since Java 9 ( and 10 and 12 ) is no longer supported , Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest version ( currently Java 13 ) or an LTS release .",
