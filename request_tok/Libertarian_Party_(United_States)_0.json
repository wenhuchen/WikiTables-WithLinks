  "/wiki/President_of_the_United_States": "The president of the United States ( POTUS ) [ B ] is the head of state and head of government of the United States of America . The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces . In contemporary times , the president is looked upon as one of the world 's most powerful political figures as the leader of the only remaining global superpower . The role includes responsibility for the world 's most expensive military , which has the second largest nuclear arsenal . The president also leads the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP . The president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power . Article II of the Constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal government . It vests the executive power of the United States in the president . The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law , alongside the responsibility of appointing federal executive , diplomatic , regulatory and judicial officers , and concluding treaties with foreign powers with the advice and consent of the Senate . The president is further empowered to grant federal pardons and reprieves , and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of Congress under extraordinary circumstances . The president directs the foreign and domestic policies of the United States , and takes an active role in promoting his policy priorities to members of Congress . In addition , as part of the system of checks and balances , Article I , Section 7 of the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or veto federal legislation .",
  "/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States": "The vice president of the United States is the second-highest officer in the executive branch of the U.S. federal government , after the president of the United States , and ranks first in the presidential line of succession . The vice president is also an officer in the legislative branch , as president of the Senate . In this capacity , the vice president is empowered to preside over Senate deliberations , but may not vote except to cast a tie-breaking vote . The vice president also presides over joint sessions of Congress . The vice president is indirectly elected together with the president to a four-year term of office by the people of the United States through the Electoral College . Section 2 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment , ratified in 1967 , created a mechanism for intra-term vice presidential succession , establishing that vice presidential vacancies will be filled by the president and confirmed by both houses of Congress . Prior to 1967 , in the event a vice president succeeded to the presidency , died , or resigned from office , the vice presidency remained vacant until the next presidential and vice presidential terms began . The vice president is also a statutory member of the National Security Council , and the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution . The Office of the Vice President assists and organises the vice president 's official functions . The role of the vice presidency has changed dramatically since the office was created during the 1787 constitutional Convention . Especially over the past 100 years , the vice presidency has evolved into a position of domestic and foreign policy political power , and is now widely seen as an integral part of a president 's administration . As the vice president 's role within the executive branch has expanded , his role within the legislative branch has contracted ; for example , he presides over the Senate only infrequently .",
  "/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)": "The Electoral College is a body of electors established by the United States Constitution , which forms every four years for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice president of the United States . The Electoral College consists of 538 electors , and an absolute majority of at least 270 electoral votes is required to win election . According to Article II , Section 1 , Clause 2 of the Constitution , each state legislature determines the manner by which its state 's electors are chosen . Each state 's number of electors is equal to the combined total of the state 's membership in the Senate and House of Representatives ; currently there are 100 senators and 435 representatives . Additionally , the Twenty-third Amendment , ratified in 1961 , provides that the District of Columbia ( D.C. ) is entitled to the number of electors it would have if it were the least populated state ( presently 3 ) . U.S. territories are not entitled to any electors as they are not states . Following the national presidential election , which takes place the Tuesday after the first Monday of November , each state counts its popular votes according to that state 's laws to designate presidential electors . In forty-eight states , the winner of the plurality of the statewide vote receives all of the electors ; in Maine and Nebraska , two electors are assigned in this manner and one elector allocated based on the plurality of votes in each congressional district . Electors are typically required to pledge to vote for the winning candidate , but there is an ongoing legal dispute about whether electors are required to vote as they pledged . State electors meet in their respective state capitals the first Monday after the second Wednesday of December to cast their votes . The results are counted by Congress , where they are tabulated nationally in the first week of January before a joint meeting of the Senate and House of Representatives , presided over by the vice president , acting as president of the Senate . If a majority of votes are not cast for a candidate , the House turns itself into a presidential election session , where one vote is assigned to each of the fifty states , excluding the District of Columbia .",
  "/wiki/1972_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1972 United States presidential election was the 47th quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday , November 7 , 1972 . Incumbent Republican President Richard Nixon from California defeated Democratic U.S . Senator George McGovern of South Dakota . Until 1984 , this was the largest margin of victory in the Electoral College in a U.S. presidential election . Nixon easily swept aside challenges from two Republican congressmen in the 1972 Republican primaries to win re-nomination . McGovern , who had played a significant role in reforming the Democratic nomination system after the 1968 election , mobilized the anti-war movement and other liberal supporters to win his party 's nomination . Among the candidates he defeated were early front-runner Edmund Muskie , 1968 nominee Hubert Humphrey , and Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm , the first African-American to run for a major party 's presidential nomination . Nixon emphasized the strong economy and his success in foreign affairs , while McGovern ran on a platform calling for an immediate end to the Vietnam War , and the institution of a guaranteed minimum income . Nixon maintained a large and consistent lead in polling . Separately , Nixon 's reelection committee broke into the Watergate complex to wiretap the Democratic National Committee 's headquarters , a scandal that would later be known as Watergate . McGovern 's campaign was further damaged by the revelation that his running mate , Thomas Eagleton , had undergone psychiatric electroshock therapy as a treatment for depression .",

  "/wiki/1976_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1976 United States presidential election was the 48th quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday , November 2 , 1976 . Democrat Jimmy Carter of Georgia defeated incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford from Michigan . Carter 's win represented the lone Democratic victory in a presidential election held between 1968 and 1992 . President Richard Nixon had won the 1972 election with Spiro Agnew as his running mate , but in 1973 Agnew resigned and Ford was appointed as vice president via the 25th Amendment . When Nixon resigned in 1974 in the wake of the Watergate scandal , Ford ascended to the presidency , becoming the only president to have never been elected to national office . He faced a strong challenge from conservative former governor and future president Ronald Reagan of California in the Republican primaries , but Ford narrowly prevailed at the convention . Carter was little-known at the start of the Democratic primaries , but the former governor of Georgia emerged as the front-runner after his victories in the first set of primaries . Campaigning as a political moderate and Washington outsider , Carter defeated opponents such as Jerry Brown and Mo Udall to clinch the Democratic nomination . Ford pursued a Rose Garden strategy in which he sought to portray himself as an experienced leader focused on fulfilling his role as chief executive . Carter emphasized his status as a reformer who was untainted by Washington . Saddled with a poor economy , the fall of South Vietnam and his unpopular pardon of Nixon , Ford trailed by a wide margin in polls taken after Carter 's formal nomination in July 1976 .",

  "/wiki/1980_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1980 United States presidential election was the 49th quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday , November 4 , 1980 . Republican nominee Ronald Reagan defeated Democrat Jimmy Carter . Due to the rise of conservatism following Reagan 's victory , some historians consider the election to be a realigning election that marked the start of the Reagan Era . Carter 's unpopularity and poor relations with Democratic leaders encouraged an intra-party challenge by Senator Ted Kennedy , a younger brother of former President John F. Kennedy . Carter defeated Kennedy in the majority of the Democratic primaries , but Kennedy remained in the race until Carter was officially nominated at the 1980 Democratic National Convention . The Republican primaries were contested between Reagan , who had previously served as the Governor of California , former Congressman George H. W. Bush of Texas , Congressman John B. Anderson of Illinois , and several other candidates . All of Reagan 's opponents had dropped out by the end of the primaries , and the 1980 Republican National Convention nominated a ticket consisting of Reagan and Bush . Anderson entered the race as an independent candidate , and convinced former Wisconsin Governor Patrick Lucey , a Democrat , to serve as his running mate . Reagan campaigned for increased defense spending , implementation of supply-side economic policies , and a balanced budget . His campaign was aided by Democratic dissatisfaction with Carter , the Iran hostage crisis , and a worsening economy at home marked by high unemployment and inflation . Carter attacked Reagan as a dangerous right-wing extremist and warned that Reagan would cut Medicare and Social Security .",

  "/wiki/1984_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1984 United States presidential election was the 50th quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday , November 6 , 1984 . Incumbent Republican President Ronald Reagan defeated former Vice President Walter Mondale , the Democratic candidate . Reagan faced only token opposition in his bid for re-nomination by the Republicans , so he and Vice President George H. W. Bush were easily re-nominated . Mondale defeated activist Jesse Jackson and several other candidates in the 1984 Democratic primaries before eventually choosing U.S. Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York as his running mate , the first woman to be on a major party 's presidential ticket . Reagan touted a strong economic recovery from the 1970s stagflation and the 1981-82 recession , as well as the widespread perception that his presidency had overseen a revival of national confidence and prestige . The Reagan campaign produced effective television advertising and deftly neutralized concerns regarding Reagan 's age . Mondale criticized Reagan 's supply-side economic policies and budget deficits , and he called for a nuclear freeze and ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment . Reagan won 58.8% of the popular vote and carried 49 of the 50 states , becoming the oldest person to win a presidential election .

Bush had alienated many of the conservatives in his party by breaking his 1988 campaign pledge against raising taxes , but he fended off a primary challenge from conservative commentator Pat Buchanan .

Truman in 1948 as one of the greatest political upsets in modern U.S. history .
