  "/wiki/British_prime_minister": "The prime minister of the United Kingdom ( informally abbreviated to PM ) , until 1801 known as the prime minister of Great Britain , is the head of government of the United Kingdom . The prime minister directs both the executive and the legislature , and together with their Cabinet is accountable to the monarch , to Parliament , to their party , and ultimately to the electorate , for the government 's policies and actions . The office of Prime Minister is not established by any statute or constitutional document but exists only by long-established convention , whereby the reigning monarch appoints as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons ; this individual is typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber . The position of Prime Minister was not created ; it evolved slowly and organically over three hundred years due to numerous Acts of Parliament , political developments , and accidents of history . The office is therefore best understood from a historical perspective . The origins of the position are found in constitutional changes that occurred during the Revolutionary Settlement ( 1688-1720 ) and the resulting shift of political power from the Sovereign to Parliament . Although the sovereign was not stripped of the ancient prerogative powers and legally remained the head of government , politically it gradually became necessary for him or her to govern through a prime minister who could command a majority in Parliament . By the 1830s , the Westminster system of government ( or cabinet government ) had emerged ; the prime minister had become primus inter pares or the first among equals in the Cabinet and the head of government in the United Kingdom . The political position of Prime Minister was enhanced by the development of modern political parties , the introduction of mass communication and photography . By the start of the 20th century the modern premiership had emerged ; the office had become the pre-eminent position in the constitutional hierarchy vis-\u00e0-vis the Sovereign , Parliament and Cabinet . Prior to 1902 , the prime minister sometimes came from the House of Lords , provided that his government could form a majority in the Commons . However as the power of the aristocracy waned during the 19th century the convention developed that the prime minister should always sit as a Member of Parliament ( MP ) in the lower house , making them answerable only to the Commons in Parliament .",
  "/wiki/David_Cameron": "David William Donald Cameron ( born 9 October 1966 ) is a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2016 . He was the Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Witney from 2001 to 2016 and leader of the Conservative Party from 2005 to 2016 . He identifies as a one-nation conservative , and has been associated with both economically liberal and socially liberal policies . Born in London to an upper-middle-class family , Cameron was educated at Heatherdown School , Eton College , and Brasenose College , Oxford . From 1988 to 1993 he worked at the Conservative Research Department , latterly assisting the Conservative Prime Minister John Major , before leaving politics to work for Carlton Communications in 1994 . Becoming an MP in 2001 , he served in the opposition shadow cabinet under Conservative leader Michael Howard , and succeeded Howard in 2005 . Cameron sought to rebrand the Conservatives , embracing an increasingly socially liberal position . The 2010 general election led to Cameron becoming Prime Minister as the head of a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats - the youngest holder of the office since the 1810s . His premiership was marked by the ongoing effects of the late-2000s financial crisis ; these involved a large deficit in government finances that his government sought to reduce through austerity measures . His administration introduced large-scale changes to welfare , immigration policy , education , and healthcare . It privatised the Royal Mail and some other state assets , and legalised same-sex marriage in England and Wales . Internationally , his government intervened militarily in the Libyan Civil War and later authorised the bombing of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ; domestically , his government oversaw the referendum on voting reform and Scottish independence referendum , both of which confirmed Cameron 's favoured outcome .",
