  "/wiki/Loch_Leven_(Kinross)": "Loch Leven ( Scottish Gaelic : Loch L\u00ecobhann ) is a fresh water loch located immediately to the east of the burgh of Kinross in Perth and Kinross council area , central Scotland . Roughly triangular , the loch is about 6 km ( 3.7 mi ) at its longest . Prior to the canalisation of the River Leven , and the partial draining of the loch in 1826-36 , Loch Leven was considerably larger . The drop in water level by 1.4 m ( 4 ft 7 in ) reduced to the loch to 75% of its former size , and exposed several small islands , as well as greatly increasing the size of the existing ones . There are seven islands on the loch , the largest being St Serf 's Inch . Loch Leven Castle , where Mary , Queen of Scots was imprisoned in 1567 , lies on one of these islands , and it can be reached by a ferry operated from Kinross by Historic Environment Scotland during the summer months . It is thought that the loch may be the site of an impact structure formed 270 million years ago . Scottish Natural Heritage ( SNH ) have described Loch Leven as one of Scotlands top natural assets , due to its rich ecosystem that supports many different species of plants , insects , fish and birds . It is of particular significance to migrating birds , who use it as a stopover when flying between their breeding and wintering grounds , due its lowland location , shallow nutrient rich waters , large water surface , and islands ( which provide safe nesting sites ) . Loch Leven holds numerous national and international conservation designations , including being a national nature reserve ( NNR ) .",
  "/wiki/Loch_Leven_Castle": "Loch Leven Castle is a ruined castle on an island in Loch Leven , in the Perth and Kinross local authority area of Scotland . Possibly built around 1300 , the castle was the location of military action during the Wars of Scottish Independence ( 1296-1357 ) . In the latter part of the 14th century , the castle was granted by his uncle to William Douglas , 1st Earl of Douglas , and remained in Douglases ' hands for the next 300 years . Mary , Queen of Scots was imprisoned here in 1567-68 , and forced to abdicate as queen , before escaping with the help of her gaoler 's family . In 1588 , the Queen 's gaoler inherited the title Earl of Morton , and moved away from the castle . It was bought , in 1675 , by Sir William Bruce , who used the castle as a focal point in his garden ; it was never again used as a residence . Today , the remains of the castle are protected as a scheduled monument in the care of Historic Environment Scotland . Loch Leven Castle is accessible in summer by the public via a ferry .",
