It is one of the monkey species most often seen and heard in the wild in Central America . It takes its mantled name from the long guard hairs on its sides . The mantled howler is one of the largest Central American monkeys , and males can weigh up to 9.8 kg ( 22 lb ) . It is the only Central American monkey that eats large quantities of leaves ; it has several adaptations to this folivorous diet . Since leaves are difficult to digest and provide less energy than most foods , the mantled howler spends the majority of each day resting and sleeping . The male mantled howler has an enlarged hyoid bone , a hollow bone near the vocal cords , which amplifies the calls made by the male , and is the reason for the name howler . Howling allows the monkeys to locate each other without expending energy on moving or risking physical confrontation . The mantled howler lives in groups that can have over 40 members , although groups are usually smaller . Most mantled howlers of both sexes are evicted from the group they were born in upon reaching sexual maturity , resulting in most adult group members being unrelated . The most dominant male , the alpha male , gets preference for food and resting places , and mates with most of the receptive females . The mantled howler is important to the rainforest ecology as a seed disperser and germinator .",

  "/wiki/Callitrichidae": "The Callitrichidae ( also called Arctopitheci or Hapalidae ) are a family of New World monkeys , including marmosets , tamarins and lion tamarins . At times , this group of animals has been regarded as a subfamily , called Callitrichinae , of the family Cebidae . This taxon was traditionally thought to be a primitive lineage , from which all the larger-bodied platyrrhines evolved . However , some works argue that callitrichids are actually a dwarfed lineage . Ancestral stem-callitrichids likely were normal-sized ceboids that were dwarfed through evolutionary time . This may exemplify a rare example of insular dwarfing in a mainland context , with the islands being formed by biogeographic barriers during arid climatic periods when forest distribution became patchy , and/or by the extensive river networks in the Amazon Basin . All callitrichids are arboreal . They are the smallest of the simian primates . They eat insects , fruit , and the sap or gum from trees ; occasionally they take small vertebrates . The marmosets rely quite heavily on tree exudates , with some species ( e.g . Callithrix jacchus and Cebuella pygmaea ) considered obligate exudativores . Callitrichids typically live in small , territorial groups of about five or six animals .",
