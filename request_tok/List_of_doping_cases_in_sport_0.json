It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean , with the Celtic Sea to the south , St George 's Channel to the south-east , and the Irish Sea to the east . It is a unitary , parliamentary republic . The legislature , the Oireachtas , consists of a lower house , D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann , an upper house , Seanad \u00c9ireann , and an elected President ( Uachtar\u00e1n ) who serves as the largely ceremonial head of state , but with some important powers and duties . The head of government is the Taoiseach ( Prime Minister , literally 'Chief ' , a title not used in English ) , who is elected by the D\u00e1il and appointed by the President ; the Taoiseach in turn appoints other government ministers . The state was created as the Irish Free State in 1922 as a result of the Anglo-Irish Treaty . It had the status of Dominion until 1937 when a new constitution was adopted , in which the state was named Ireland and effectively became a republic , with an elected non-executive president as head of state . It was officially declared a republic in 1949 , following the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 . Ireland became a member of the United Nations in December 1955 .",
  "/wiki/Fluphenazine": "Fluphenazine , sold under the brand names Prolixin among others , is an antipsychotic medication . It is used in the treatment of chronic psychoses such as schizophrenia , and appears to be about equal in effectiveness to low-potency antipsychotics like chlorpromazine . It is given by mouth , injection into a muscle , or just under the skin . There is also a long acting injectable version that may last for up to four weeks . Fluphenazine decanoate , the depot injection form of fluphenazine , should not be used by people with severe depression . Common side effects include movement problems , sleepiness , depression and increased weight . Serious side effects may include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , low white blood cell levels , and the potentially permanent movement disorder tardive dyskinesia . In older people with psychosis as a result of dementia it may increase the risk of dying . It may also increase prolactin levels which may result in milk production , enlarged breasts in males , impotence , and the absence of menstrual periods . It is unclear if it is safe for use in pregnancy . Fluphenazine is a typical antipsychotic of the phenothiazine class . Its mechanism of action is not entirely clear but believed to be related to its ability to block dopamine receptors .",
