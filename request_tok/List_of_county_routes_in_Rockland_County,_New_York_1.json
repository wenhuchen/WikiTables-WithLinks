  "/wiki/New_Jersey": "New Jersey is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the Northeastern United States . It is bordered on the north and east by the state of New York ; on the east , southeast , and south by the Atlantic Ocean ; on the west by the Delaware River and Pennsylvania ; and on the southwest by the Delaware Bay and the State of Delaware . New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state by area but the 11th-most populous , with 9 million residents as of 2017 and an area of 8,722.58 square miles , making it the most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states , with its biggest city being Newark . New Jersey lies completely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia . New Jersey was the second-wealthiest U.S. state by median household income as of 2017 . New Jersey was inhabited by Native Americans for more than 2,800 years , with historical tribes such as the Lenape along the coast . In the early 17th century , the Dutch and the Swedes founded the first European settlements in the state . The English later seized control of the region , naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest of the Channel Islands , Jersey , and granting it as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley , 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton . New Jersey was the site of several important battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century . In the 19th century , factories in the cities Camden , Paterson , Newark , Trenton , Jersey City , and Elizabeth ( known as the Big Six ) , helped drive the Industrial Revolution . New Jersey 's geographic location at the center of the Northeast megalopolis , between Boston and New York City to the northeast , and Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Washington , D.C. , to the southwest , fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century . At the turn of the 21st century , this suburbanization began reverting with the consolidation of New Jersey 's culturally diverse populace toward more urban settings within the state , with towns home to commuter rail stations outpacing the population growth of more automobile-oriented suburbs since 2008 .",

While most of US 202 is signed north-south , the portion within New York is signed east-west . It drifts north slowly as it crosses southern New York . US 202 is the only road to cross New York between New Jersey and Connecticut and not pass through New York City on the way . As it does in other states , Route 202 serves mainly as a local road in suburban and exurban communities along the outskirts of the metropolitan area , mostly two lanes with the exception of some four-lane sections and a brief concurrency onto an expressway in Peekskill . Its course along the Hudson River takes it first north up the west side , over the historic Bear Mountain Bridge , then south along the east side . It takes in many scenic areas , such as the Ramapo Mountains and Hudson Highlands , and two New York City reservoirs . Its circuitous path across the state puts it on many concurrencies - only 14.5 miles ( 23.3 km ) , or 26% , of Route 202 's mileage in New York is signed as US 202 alone . Among the roads it joins are three U.S. highways and two state routes .

  "/wiki/NY_17": "New York State Route 17 ( NY 17 ) is a major state highway that extends for 397 miles ( 638.91 km ) through the Southern Tier and Downstate regions of New York in the United States . It begins at the Pennsylvania state line in Mina and follows the Southern Tier Expressway east through Corning to Binghamton and the Quickway from Binghamton east to Woodbury , where it turns south to follow the Orange Turnpike to the New Jersey state line near Suffern , where it connects to New Jersey Route 17 . From the Pennsylvania border to the village of Waverly and from Binghamton to Windsor , NY 17 is concurrent with Interstate 86 ( I-86 ) . Eventually , the entire east-west portion of NY 17 from the Pennsylvania border to Woodbury will become I-86 as projects to upgrade the route to Interstate Highway standards are completed . At 397 miles , NY 17 is the longest state route in New York , and its second-longest highway of any kind besides the Thruway . It serves 11 counties ( Chautauqua , Cattaraugus , Allegany , Steuben , Chemung , Tioga , Broome , Delaware , Sullivan , Orange , and Rockland ) , passes through the cities of Salamanca , Olean , Corning , Elmira , and Binghamton , and enters the vicinity of several others , including Jamestown and Middletown . As it proceeds across the state , it intersects many of New York 's Interstate and U.S . Highways , including U.S. Route 219 ( US 219 ) in Salamanca , I-99 and US 15 near Corning , I-81 in Binghamton , and I-84 near Middletown . The portion of NY 17 in the vicinity of Waverly is actually located in Pennsylvania ; however , it is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) . The route was assigned in 1924 , extending from Westfield to Suffern via at-grade highways . It was moved onto the Quickway and the Southern Tier Expressway as sections of both were completed from the 1950s to the 1980s . Two of NY 17 's suffixed routes , NY 17C and NY 17M , follow substantial portions of NY 17 's pre-freeway alignment .",
