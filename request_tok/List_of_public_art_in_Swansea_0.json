  "/wiki/Weather_vane": "A weather vane , wind vane , or weathercock is an instrument used for showing the direction of the wind . It is typically used as an architectural ornament to the highest point of a building . The word vane comes from the Old English word fana , meaning 'flag ' . Although partly functional , weather vanes are generally decorative , often featuring the traditional cockerel design with letters indicating the points of the compass . Other common motifs include ships , arrows and horses . Not all weather vanes have pointers . When the wind is sufficiently strong , the head of the arrow or cockerel ( or equivalent depending on the chosen design ) will indicate the direction from which the wind is blowing . The weather vane was independently invented in ancient China and Greece around the same time during the 2nd century BCE . The earliest written reference to a weather vane appears in the Huainanzi , and a weather vane was fitted on top of the Tower of the Winds in Athens .",

  "/wiki/Sundial": "A sundial is a device that tells the time of day when there is sunlight by the apparent position of the Sun in the sky . In the narrowest sense of the word , it consists of a flat plate ( the dial ) and a gnomon , which casts a shadow onto the dial . As the Sun appears to move across the sky , the shadow aligns with different hour-lines , which are marked on the dial to indicate the time of day . The style is the time-telling edge of the gnomon , though a single point or nodus may be used . The gnomon casts a broad shadow ; the shadow of the style shows the time . The gnomon may be a rod , wire , or elaborately decorated metal casting . The style must be parallel to the axis of the Earth 's rotation for the sundial to be accurate throughout the year . The style 's angle from horizontal is equal to the sundial 's geographical latitude . In a broader sense , a sundial is any device that uses the Sun 's altitude or azimuth ( or both ) to show the time . In addition to their time-telling function , sundials are valued as decorative objects , literary metaphors , and objects of intrigue and mathematical study . A rudimentary sundial can be easily constructed to mark the passing of time by placing a stick in the sand or a nail in a board and placing markers at the edge of a shadow or outlining a shadow at intervals . It is common for inexpensive , mass-produced decorative sundials to have incorrectly aligned gnomons , shadow lengths , and hour-lines , which can not be adjusted to tell correct time .",

  "/wiki/Mermaid": "In folklore , a mermaid is an aquatic creature with the head and upper body of a female human and the tail of a fish . Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide , including the Near East , Europe , Asia , and Africa . In ancient Assyria the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame for accidentally killing her human lover . Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods , storms , shipwrecks , and drownings . In other folk traditions ( or sometimes within the same tradition ) , they can be benevolent or beneficent , bestowing boons or falling in love with humans . The male equivalent of the mermaid is the merman , also a familiar figure in folklore and heraldry . Although traditions about and sightings of mermen are less common than those of mermaids , they are generally assumed to co-exist with their female counterparts . The male and the female collectively are sometimes referred to as merfolk or merpeople . The conception of mermaids in the West may have been influenced by the Sirens of Greek mythology , which were originally half-birdlike , but came to be pictured as half-fishlike in the Christian era . Historical accounts of mermaids , such as those reported by Christopher Columbus during his exploration of the Caribbean , may have been sightings of manatees or similar aquatic mammals . While there is no evidence that mermaids exist outside folklore , reports of mermaid sightings continue to the present day . Mermaids have been a popular subject of art and literature in recent centuries , such as in Hans Christian Andersen 's literary fairy tale The Little Mermaid ( 1836 ) .",
