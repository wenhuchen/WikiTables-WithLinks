  "/wiki/Draw_(poker)": "A poker player is drawing if they have a hand that is incomplete and needs further cards to become valuable . The hand itself is called a draw or drawing hand . For example , in seven-card stud , if four of a player 's first five cards are all spades , but the hand is otherwise weak , they are drawing to a flush . In contrast , a made hand already has value and does not necessarily need to draw to win . A made starting hand with no help can lose to an inferior starting hand with a favorable draw . If an opponent has a made hand that will beat the player 's draw , then the player is drawing dead ; even if they make their desired hand , they will lose . Not only draws benefit from additional cards ; many made hands can be improved by catching an out - and may have to in order to win .",
