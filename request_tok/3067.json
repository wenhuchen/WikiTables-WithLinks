  "/wiki/US_Representative": "The United States House of Representatives is the lower house of the United States Congress , the Senate being the upper house . Together they compose the national legislature of the United States . The composition of the House is established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The House is composed of representatives who sit in congressional districts that are allocated to each of the 50 states on a basis of population as measured by the U.S. Census , with each district entitled to one representative . Since its inception in 1789 , all representatives have been directly elected . The total number of voting representatives is fixed by law at 435 . As of the 2010 Census , the largest delegation is that of California , with fifty-three representatives . Seven states have only one representative : Alaska , Delaware , Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota , Vermont , and Wyoming . The House is charged with the passage of federal legislation , known as bills , which , after concurrence by the Senate , are sent to the president for consideration . In addition to this basic power , the House has certain exclusive powers , among them the power to initiate all bills related to revenue ; the impeachment of federal officers , who are sent to trial before the Senate ; and , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for president , the duty falls upon the House to elect one of the top three recipients of electors for that office , with one vote given to each state for that purpose . The House meets in the south wing of the United States Capitol . The presiding officer is the speaker of the House , who is elected by the members thereof ( and is therefore traditionally the leader of the controlling party ) .",

Furthermore , the Senate has the responsibility of conducting the trials of those impeached by the House . The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms , smaller size , and statewide constituencies , which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere .",

Oregon State Senators serve four-year terms without term limits . In 2002 , the Oregon Supreme Court struck down the decade-old Oregon Ballot Measure 3 , that had restricted State Senators to two terms ( eight years ) on procedural grounds . Like certain other upper houses of state and territorial legislatures and the federal U.S. Senate , the State Senate can confirm or reject gubernatorial appointments to state departments , commissions , boards , and other state governmental agencies . The current Senate President is Peter Courtney of Salem . Oregon , along with Arizona , Maine , and Wyoming , is one of the four U.S. states to not have the Office of the Lieutenant Governor , a position which for most upper houses of state legislatures and indeed for the U.S. Congress ( with the Vice President ) is the head of the legislative body and holder of the casting vote in the event of a tie . Instead , a separate position of Senate President is in place , removed from the state executive branch . If the chamber is tied , legislators must devise their own methods of resolving the impasse . In 2002 , for example , Oregon 's state senators entered into a power sharing contract whereby Democratic senators nominated the Senate President while Republican senators chaired key committees .",

  "/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_Canada": "The House of Commons of Canada ( French : Chambre des communes du Canada ) is the lower chamber of the bicameral Parliament of Canada , along with the sovereign ( represented by the governor general ) and the Senate of Canada . The House of Commons currently meets in a temporary Commons chamber in the West Block of the parliament buildings on Parliament Hill in Ottawa , while the Centre Block , which houses the traditional Commons chamber , undergoes a ten-year renovation . The House of Commons is a democratically elected body whose members are known as Members of Parliament ( MPs ) . There were 308 members in the 2011-2015 parliament ( most members elected in 2011 ) , but that number rose to 338 following the election on Monday October 19 , 2015 . Members are elected by simple plurality ( first-past-the-post system ) in each of the country 's electoral districts , which are colloquially known as ridings . MPs may hold office until Parliament is dissolved and serve for constitutionally limited terms of up to five years after an election . Historically however , terms have ended before their expiry and the sitting government has typically dissolved parliament within four years of an election according to a long-standing convention . In any case , an Act of Parliament now limits each term to four years . Seats in the House of Commons are distributed roughly in proportion to the population of each province and territory . However , some ridings are more populous than others , and the Canadian constitution contains provisions regarding provincial representation . As a result , there is some interprovincial and regional malapportionment relative to the population . The House of Commons was established in 1867 , when the British North America Act ( now called the Constitution Act , 1867 ) created the Dominion of Canada and was modelled on the British House of Commons .",
