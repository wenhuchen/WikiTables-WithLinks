Hitchcock then cast him again in Strangers on a Train , as a tennis star drawn into a double murder plot by a wealthy psychopath , played by Robert Walker .

  "/wiki/Joan_Crawford": "Joan Crawford ( born Lucille Fay LeSueur ; March 23 , 190 ? [ Note 1 ] - May 10 , 1977 ) was an American film and television actress who began her career as a dancer in traveling theatrical companies before debuting as a chorus girl on Broadway . Crawford then signed a motion picture contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1925 ; her career spanned six decades and fifty-five years , multiple studios , and controversies . At different stages of her career , she was noted for her diverse roles playing sympathetic and unsympathetic characters , and for realistic yet mutli-layered performances . Her films ranged in genres from contemporary crime , melodramas , film noir , several historical costume dramas , romances , mysteries , musicals , suspense , horror , to three westerns and over a dozen comedies . Regardless , her greater successes and perhaps most memorable performances were in romantic dramas and melodramas . In 1999 , The American Film Institute ranked Crawford tenth on its list of the greatest female stars of Classic Hollywood Cinema . In the 1930s , Crawford 's fame rivaled and later surpassed that of MGM colleagues Norma Shearer and Greta Garbo . Though she started portraying flappers , Crawford often played wealthy women in distress ( Dance , Fools , Dance , This Modern Age , Letty Lynton , No More Ladies , I Live My Life , Susan and God ) or hard-working young women who found romance and success ( Our Dancing Daughters , Paid , Laughing Sinners , Dancing Lady , Sadie McKee , The Last of Mrs. Cheyney , The Shining Hour , The Bride Wore Red , Mannequin ) . These characters and stories were well received by Depression-era audiences , and were popular with women . Crawford became one of Hollywood 's more prominent movie stars , and one of the higher-paid women in the United States . In 1945 , she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her work in Mildred Pierce , and received Best Actress nominations for Possessed ( 1947 ) and Sudden Fear ( 1952 ) .",

  "/wiki/Trucolor": "Trucolor was a color motion picture process used and owned by the Consolidated Film Industries division of Republic Pictures . It was introduced as a replacement for Consolidated 's own Magnacolor process . Republic used Trucolor mostly for its Westerns , through the 1940s and early 1950s . The premiere Trucolor release was Out California Way ( 1946 ) and the last film photographed in the process was Spoilers of the Forest ( 1957 ) . With the advent of Eastmancolor and Ansco color films , which gave better results at a cheaper price , Trucolor was abandoned , coincidentally at the same time as Republic 's demise . At the time of its introduction , Trucolor was a two-color subtractive color process . Approximately three years later , the manufacturer expanded the process to include a three-color release system based on DuPont film stock . They later replaced the DuPont film with Eastman Kodak film stock . Thus , in its life span of approximately twelve years , the Trucolor process was in reality three distinct systems for color release prints , all bearing the same Trucolor screen credit . Yet , even by 1950 , some filmgoers and entertainment publications found Trucolor productions at times deficient and visually distracting due to color inaccuracies . As part of its review of the Roy Rogers oatuner Twilight in the Sierras , the influential trade paper Variety stated quite pointedly , Trucolor tinting adds to the production values despite the overall untrue reproduction of facial and landscape hues .",

  "/wiki/VistaVision": "VistaVision is a higher resolution , widescreen variant of the 35 mm motion picture film format which was created by engineers at Paramount Pictures in 1954 . Paramount did not use anamorphic processes such as CinemaScope but refined the quality of their flat widescreen system by orienting the 35 mm negative horizontally in the camera gate and shooting onto a larger area , which yielded a finer-grained projection print . As finer-grained film stocks appeared on the market , VistaVision became obsolete . Paramount dropped the format after only seven years , although for another forty years the format was used by some European and Japanese producers for feature films , and by American films such as the first three Star Wars movies for high resolution special effects sequences . In many ways , VistaVision was a testing ground for cinematography ideas that evolved into 70 mm IMAX and OMNIMAX film formats in the 1970s . Both IMAX and OMNIMAX are oriented sideways , like VistaVision .",

Warner Bros. released the film on October 27 , 1955 , almost a month after Dean 's death in a car accident on September 30 , 1955 .

  "/wiki/CinemaScope": "CinemaScope is an anamorphic lens series used , from 1953 to 1967 , and less often later , for shooting widescreen movies that , crucially , could be screened in theatres using existing equipment , albeit with a lens adapter . Its creation in 1953 by Spyros P. Skouras , the president of 20th Century Fox , marked the beginning of the modern anamorphic format in both principal photography and movie projection . The anamorphic lenses theoretically allowed the process to create an image of up to a 2.66:1 aspect ratio , almost twice as wide as the previously common Academy format 's 1.37:1 ratio . Although the technology behind the CinemaScope lens system was made obsolete by later developments , primarily advanced by Panavision , CinemaScope 's anamorphic format has continued to this day . In film-industry jargon , the shortened form , 'Scope , is still widely used by both filmmakers and projectionists , although today it generally refers to any 2.35:1 , 2.39:1 , 2.40:1 or 2.55:1 presentation or , sometimes , the use of anamorphic lensing or projection in general .
