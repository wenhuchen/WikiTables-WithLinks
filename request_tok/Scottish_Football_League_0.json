  "/wiki/List_of_Scottish_football_champions": "The Scottish football champions are the winners of the highest league in Scottish football , namely the Scottish Football League ( SFL ) from 1890 until 1998 , the Scottish Premier League ( SPL ) from 1998 until 2013 and the Scottish Premiership thereafter . The SFL was established in 1890 , initially as an amateur league until professionalism in Scottish football was legalised in 1893 . At the end of the first season Dumbarton and Rangers finished level on points at the top of the table . The rules in force at the time required that the teams contest a play-off match for the championship , which finished in a 2-2 draw , and the first ever championship was thus shared between two clubs , the only occasion on which this has happened . In 1893 a Second Division was formed , with the existing single division renamed the First Division . The league continued during the First World War but was suspended during the Second World War . Although there were several short spells when a third division was created , the two-division structure remained largely in place until 1975 , when a major re-organisation of the league led to a new three-tier set-up and the creation of a new Premier Division at the highest level . In 1998 , the teams then in the Premier Division broke away to form the SPL , which supplanted the Premier Division as the highest level of football in Scotland . The SPL and SFL merged in 2013 to form the Scottish Professional Football League ( SPFL ) , which branded its top division as the Scottish Premiership . Throughout its existence the championship of Scottish football has been dominated by two Glasgow clubs , Celtic and Rangers . The two rivals , who are collectively known as the Old Firm , have claimed the majority of league titles . As of 2019 , Rangers have won 54 and Celtic 50 , while no other club has won the title on more than four occasions .",

This level of success was surpassed in the 1980s , when , under the management of Alex Ferguson , they won three league titles , four Scottish Cups and a Scottish League Cup , alongside the two European trophies . Aberdeen were the last club outside the Old Firm to win a league title , in 1984-85 , and also the last Scottish team to win a European trophy .
