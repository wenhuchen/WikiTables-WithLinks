In 1911 the School was transferred to Grand Rapids , along with the motherhouse of the Sisters , pursuant to an invitation of the Bishop of the young Diocese of Grand Rapids .

At some time between 1922 and 1931 it was renamed as Marywood College . In 1931 , it was reorganized as Catholic Junior College , transferred to a site on Ransom Street adjacent to the Grand Rapids Public Library , and became the first Roman Catholic college in the United States governed by women religious to become coeducational .
