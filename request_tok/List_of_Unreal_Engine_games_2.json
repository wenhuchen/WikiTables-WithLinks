  "/wiki/Platformer": "Platform games , or platformers , are a video game genre and subgenre of action game . In a platformer , the player controlled character must jump and climb between suspended platforms while avoiding obstacles . Environments often feature uneven terrain of varying height that must be traversed . The player often has some control over the height and distance of jumps to avoid letting their character fall to their death or miss necessary jumps . The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button , but now there are other alternatives like swiping a touchscreen . Other acrobatic maneuvers may factor into the gameplay as well , such as swinging from objects such as vines or grappling hooks , as in Ristar or Bionic Commando , or bouncing from springboards or trampolines , as in Alpha Waves . These mechanics , even in the context of other genres , are commonly called platforming , a verbification of platform . Games where jumping is automated completely , such as 3D games in The Legend of Zelda series , fall outside of the genre . Platform games originated in the early 1980s , which were often about climbing ladders as much as jumping , with 3D successors popularized in the mid-1990s . The term describes games where jumping on platforms is an integral part of the gameplay and came into use after the genre had been established , no later than 1983 . The genre is frequently combined with elements of other genres , such as the shooter elements in Contra , Beat 'em up elements of Viewtiful Joe , adventure elements of Flashback , or role-playing game elements of Castlevania : Symphony of the Night . While commonly associated with console gaming , there have been many important platform games released to video arcades , as well as for handheld game consoles and home computers .",
  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

  "/wiki/Adventure_game": "In video game culture , an adventure game is a video game in which the player assumes the role of a protagonist in an interactive story driven by exploration and puzzle-solving . The genre 's focus on story allows it to draw heavily from other narrative-based media , literature and film , encompassing a wide variety of literary genres . Many adventure games ( text and graphic ) are designed for a single player , since this emphasis on story and character makes multi-player design difficult . Colossal Cave Adventure is identified [ by whom ? ] as the first such adventure game , first released in 1976 , while other notable adventure game series include Zork , King 's Quest , The Secret of Monkey Island , and Myst . Initial adventure games developed in the 1970s and early 1980s were text-based , using text parsers to translate the player 's input into commands . As personal computers became more powerful with better graphics , the graphic adventure-game format became popular , initially by augmenting player 's text commands with graphics , but soon moving towards point-and-click interfaces . Further computer advances led to adventure games with more immersive graphics using real-time or pre-rendered three-dimensional scenes or full-motion video taken from the first- or third-person perspective . For markets in the Western hemisphere , the genre 's popularity peaked during the late 1980s to mid-1990s when many [ quantify ] considered it to be among the most technically advanced genres , but it had become a niche genre in the early 2000s due to the popularity of first-person shooters , and it became difficult for developers to find publishers to support adventure-game ventures . Since then , a resurgence in the genre has occurred , spurred on by the success of independent video-game development , particularly from crowdfunding efforts , from the wide availability of digital distribution enabling episodic approaches , and from the proliferation of new gaming platforms , including portable consoles and mobile devices . The Walking Dead is considered [ by whom ? ] to be a key title which rejuvenated the genre .",

  "/wiki/Survival_horror": "Survival horror is a subgenre of video games inspired by horror fiction that focuses on survival of the character as the game tries to frighten players with either horror graphics or scary ambience . Although combat can be part of the gameplay , the player is made to feel less in control than in typical action games through limited ammunition , health , speed and vision , or through various obstructions of the player 's interaction with the game mechanics . The player is also challenged to find items that unlock the path to new areas and solve puzzles to proceed in the game . Games make use of strong horror themes , like dark mazelike environments and unexpected attacks from enemies . The term survival horror was first used for the original Japanese release of Resident Evil in 1996 , which was influenced by earlier games with a horror theme such as 1989 's Sweet Home and 1992 's Alone in the Dark . The name has been used since then for games with similar gameplay , and has been retroactively applied to earlier titles . Starting with the release of Resident Evil 4 in 2005 , the genre began to incorporate more features from action games and more traditional first person and third-person shooter games .

  "/wiki/First-person_shooter": "First-person shooter ( FPS ) is a video game genre centered on gun and other weapon-based combat in a first-person perspective ; that is , the player experiences the action through the eyes of the protagonist . The genre shares common traits with other shooter games , which in turn makes it fall under the heading action game . Since the genre 's inception , advanced 3D and pseudo-3D graphics have challenged hardware development , and multiplayer gaming has been integral . The first-person shooter genre has been traced as far back as Maze War , development of which began in 1973 , and 1974 's Spasim . Later , and after more playful titles like MIDI Maze in 1987 , the genre coalesced into a more violent form with 1992 's Wolfenstein 3D , which has been credited with creating the genre 's basic archetype upon which subsequent titles were based . One such title , and the progenitor of the genre 's wider mainstream acceptance and popularity , was Doom , one of the most influential games in this genre ; for some years , the term Doom clone was used to designate this genre due to Doom 's influence . Corridor shooter was another common name for the genre in its early years , since processing limitations of the era 's hardware meant that most of the action in the games had to take place in enclosed areas , such as in cramped spaces like corridors and tunnels . 1998 's Half-Life - along with its 2004 sequel Half-Life 2 - enhanced the narrative and puzzle elements . In 1999 , the Half-Life mod Counter-Strike was released and , together with Doom , is perhaps one of the most influential first-person shooters . GoldenEye 007 , released in 1997 , was a landmark first-person shooter for home consoles , while the Halo series heightened the console 's commercial and critical appeal as a platform for first-person shooter titles .

  "/wiki/Action-adventure_game": "Action-adventure is a video game genre that combines core elements from both the action game and adventure game genres . With the decline of the adventure game genre from mainstream popularity in the early 2000s , the use of the term ( and the hybrid term action-adventure ) has been more liberal . It is not uncommon for gamers to apply the term adventure or action to describe the genre of fiction to which a game belongs , and not the gameplay itself . Action-adventure is a hybrid genre , and thus the definition is very inclusive , leading it to be perhaps the broadest genre of video games , and can include many games which might better be categorized under narrow genres . Typically , pure adventure games have situational problems for the player to solve , with very little or no action . If there is action , it is generally confined to isolated minigames . Pure action games have gameplay based on real-time interactions that challenge the reflexes . Therefore , action-adventure games engage both reflexes and problem-solving , in both violent and non-violent situations .",

  "/wiki/First-person_Shooter": "First-person shooter ( FPS ) is a video game genre centered on gun and other weapon-based combat in a first-person perspective ; that is , the player experiences the action through the eyes of the protagonist . The genre shares common traits with other shooter games , which in turn makes it fall under the heading action game . Since the genre 's inception , advanced 3D and pseudo-3D graphics have challenged hardware development , and multiplayer gaming has been integral . The first-person shooter genre has been traced as far back as Maze War , development of which began in 1973 , and 1974 's Spasim . Later , and after more playful titles like MIDI Maze in 1987 , the genre coalesced into a more violent form with 1992 's Wolfenstein 3D , which has been credited with creating the genre 's basic archetype upon which subsequent titles were based . One such title , and the progenitor of the genre 's wider mainstream acceptance and popularity , was Doom , one of the most influential games in this genre ; for some years , the term Doom clone was used to designate this genre due to Doom 's influence . Corridor shooter was another common name for the genre in its early years , since processing limitations of the era 's hardware meant that most of the action in the games had to take place in enclosed areas , such as in cramped spaces like corridors and tunnels . 1998 's Half-Life - along with its 2004 sequel Half-Life 2 - enhanced the narrative and puzzle elements . In 1999 , the Half-Life mod Counter-Strike was released and , together with Doom , is perhaps one of the most influential first-person shooters . GoldenEye 007 , released in 1997 , was a landmark first-person shooter for home consoles , while the Halo series heightened the console 's commercial and critical appeal as a platform for first-person shooter titles . In the 21st century , the first-person shooter is the most commercially viable video game genre , and in 2016 , shooters accounted for over 27% of all video game sales .

These apps are licensed by manufacturers of Android devices certified under standards imposed by Google . Other competing Android ecosystems include Amazon.com 's Fire OS , or LineageOS .
