There are 8 National Historic Landmarks (NHLs) in Nevada. The U.S. National Historic Landmark program is operated under the auspices of the National Park Service, and recognizes structures, districts, objects, and similar resources nationwide according to a list of criteria of national significance. Nevada is home to 8 of these landmarks, highlighting Nevada's frontier heritage and other themes. The National Historic Landmarks Survey: List of National Historic Landmarks by State lists seven landmarks, but includes the Leonard Rockshelter twice, and does not mention the Francis G.
