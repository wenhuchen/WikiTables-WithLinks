  "/wiki/Bledsoe's_Station": "Bledsoe 's Station , also known as Bledsoe 's Fort , was an 18th-century , fortified , frontier , white settlement located in what is now Castalian Springs , Sumner County , Tennessee . The fort was built by long hunter and Sumner County pioneer Isaac Bledsoe ( c. 1735-1793 ) in the early 1780s to protect Upper Cumberland settlers and migrants from hostile Native American attacks . While the fort is no longer standing , its location has been verified by archaeological excavations . The site is now part of Bledsoe 's Fort Historical Park , a public park established in 1989 by Sumner County residents and Bledsoe 's descendants . Bledsoe 's Station was one of a series of frontier outposts built in the Upper Cumberland during the first major migration of Euro-American settlers into the Middle Tennessee area following the American Revolution . The fort was a convenient stopover along Avery 's Trace - the main road connecting East and Middle Tennessee at the time . The flood of settlers into the region brought inevitable conflict with the region 's Native American inhabitants , and dozens of settlers were killed in the late 1780s and early 1790s . Isaac Bledsoe 's brother Anthony was killed in an ambush at the fort in 1788 , and Isaac was killed while tending a field outside the fort in 1793 . The end of the Cherokee-American wars , the following year , ended much of the violence in the region and reduced the fort 's necessity . Bledsoe 's Fort Historical Park protects the fort 's excavation site , as an outline of the fort 's walls can be discerned from former excavation trenches , as well as several historic structures , including the Nathaniel Parker Cabin and Hugh Rogan Cottage , who were compatriots of Isaac Bledsoe and a pioneer cemetery , with a large obelisk , dedicated to the Bledsoe brothers .

The camps stretched for many miles through the valley south of Fort Cass toward present-day Cleveland , Tennessee . The Cherokee population had been spread over a region that included southeast Tennessee , southwest North Carolina , northern Georgia , and northeast Alabama . The first stage of the removal process was to gather the Cherokee into a few fortified encampments or emigration depots , the largest of which was Fort Cass . Other depots were located at Ross 's Landing in Chattanooga and Fort Payne , Alabama . Fort Butler in Murphy , North Carolina served as the military headquarters in North Carolina . Before the removal began , from 1819 to 1838 , Fort Cass was the site of the U.S. federal agency to the Cherokee Nation , known simply as the Cherokee Agency , a kind of embassy . The Cherokee had ceded lands north of the Hiwassee River in 1819 , at which time an earlier federal agency was moved to the future site of Fort Cass and Charleston , on the south bank of the Hiwassee River in Cherokee territory . This Cherokee Agency was situated on the east side of present-day U.S. Highway 11 , near the intersection with Walker Valley Road . No trace remains today .

The fort was designed by John William G. De Brahm , its construction was supervised by Captain Raymond Demer\u00e9 , and its garrison was commanded by Demer\u00e9 's brother , Paul Demer\u00e9 . It was named for the Earl of Loudoun , the commander of British forces in North America at the time . Relations between the garrison of Fort Loudoun and the local Cherokee inhabitants were initially cordial , but soured in 1758 due to hostilities between Cherokee fighters and European settlers in Virginia and South Carolina . After the massacre of several Cherokee chiefs who were being held hostage at Fort Prince George , the Cherokee laid siege to Fort Loudoun in March 1760 . The fort 's garrison held out for several months , but diminishing supplies forced its surrender in August 1760 . Hostile Cherokees attacked the fort 's garrison as it marched back to South Carolina , killing more than two dozen and taking most of the survivors prisoner . The fall of Fort Loudoun led to an invasion of Cherokee territory by General James Grant and an important peace expedition to the Overhill country by Henry Timberlake . The fort was reconstructed in the 20th century based on the detailed descriptions of its design by De Brahm and Demer\u00e9 , and excavations conducted by the Works Progress Administration , the Fort Loudoun Association , and the Tennessee Division of Archaeology .
