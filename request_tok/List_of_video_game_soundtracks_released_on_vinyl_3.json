Sometimes , a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks , coordinates the production , manufacture , distribution , marketing , promotion , and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos , while also conducting talent scouting and development of new artists ( artists and repertoire or A & R ) , and maintaining contracts with recording artists and their managers .

Within the mainstream music industry , recording artists have traditionally been reliant upon record labels to broaden their consumer base , market their albums , and be both promoted and heard on music streaming services , radio , and television .

  "/wiki/Mother_2": "EarthBound ( known as Mother 2 in Japan ) [ nb 1 ] is a role-playing video game developed by Ape Inc. and HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System . The second entry in the Mother series , it was first released in Japan in August 1994 , and in North America in June 1995 . As Ness and his party of four , the player travels the world to collect melodies from eight Sanctuaries in order to defeat the evil alien force Giygas . EarthBound had a lengthy development period that spanned five years . Its returning staff from Mother ( 1989 ) included writer/director Shigesato Itoi and lead programmer Satoru Iwata , as well as composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka , who incorporated a diverse range of styles into the soundtrack , including salsa , reggae , and dub . Most of the other staff members had not worked on the original Mother , and the game came under repeated threats of cancellation until Iwata joined the team . Originally scheduled for release in January 1993 , the game was completed around May 1994 . Themed around an idiosyncratic portrayal of Americana and Western culture , EarthBound subverted popular role-playing game traditions by featuring a real world setting while parodying numerous staples of the genre . Itoi wanted the game to reach non-gamers with its intentionally goofy tone ; for example , the player uses items such as the Pencil Eraser to remove pencil statues , experiences in-game hallucinations , and battles piles of vomit , taxi cabs , and walking nooses . For its American release , the game was marketed with a $ 2 million promotional campaign that sardonically proclaimed this game stinks . Additionally , the game 's puns and humor were reworked by localizer Marcus Lindblom , and the title was changed from Mother 2 to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to . Initial reviewers had little praise for EarthBound in the United States , where it sold half as many copies as in Japan .",

In the game , the player controls the crew of a single spacecraft , holding critical information to be delivered to an allied fleet , while being pursued by a large rebel fleet . The player must guide the spacecraft over eight sectors , each with planetary systems and events procedurally generated in a roguelike fashion , while facing rebel and other hostile forces , recruiting new crew , and outfitting and upgrading their ship . Combat takes place in pausable real time , and if the ship is destroyed or all of its crew lost , the game ends , forcing the player to restart with a new ship . The concept for FTL was based on tabletop board games and other non-strategic space combat video games that required the player to manage an array of ship 's functions . The initial development by the two-man Subset Games was self-funded , and guided towards developing entries for various indie game competitions . With positive responses from the players and judges at these events , Subset opted to engage in a crowd-sourced Kickstarter campaign to finish the title , and succeeded in obtaining twenty times more than they had sought ; the extra funds were used towards more professional art , music and in-game writing . The game , considered one of the major successes of the Kickstarter fundraisers for video games , was released in September 2012 to positive reviews . An updated version , FTL : Advanced Edition , added additional ships , events , and other gameplay elements , and was released in April 2014 as a free update for existing owners and was put up for purchase on iPad devices .
