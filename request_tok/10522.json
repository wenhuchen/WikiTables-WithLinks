A sub-prefecture of the department , Cambrai is a town which had 32,518 inhabitants in the Census of 2009 . It is in the heart of the urban unit of Cambrai [ fr ] which , with 47,138 inhabitants , ranks as 7th largest of the department . Its urban area [ fr ] , a more extensive range , included 65,986 inhabitants in 2009 . With Lille and the towns of the former Nord-Pas de Calais Mining Basin , it is also part of the Metropolitan area of Lille [ fr ] which has more than 3.8 million inhabitants . Towards the end of the Roman Empire , Cambrai replaced Bavay as the capital of the land of the Nervii . At the beginning of the Merovingian era , Cambrai became the seat of an immense archdiocese covering all the right bank of the Scheldt and the centre of a small ecclesiastical principality , roughly coinciding with the shire of Brabant , including the central part of the Low Countries . The bishopric had some limited secular power and depended on the Holy Roman Empire until annexation to France in 1678 . F\u00e9nelon , nicknamed the Swan of Cambrai , was the most renowned of the archbishops . The fertile lands which surround it and the textile industry gave it prosperity in the Middle Ages , but in modern times it is less industrialised than its neighbours of Nord-Pas-de-Calais . Cambrai was the Duke of Wellington 's headquarters , for the British Army of Occupation , from 1815 to 1818 . Occupied and partly destroyed by the German army during World War I , Cambrai saw unfold in its vicinity the Battle of Cambrai ( 20 November 1917 - 3 December 1917 ) where tanks were massively and successfully used for the first time .",

He was a conservative leader , primarily committed to political and social stability . Trained in law , Poincar\u00e9 was elected as a Deputy in 1887 and served in the cabinets of Dupuy and Ribot . In 1902 , he co-founded the Democratic Republican Alliance , the most important centre-right party under the Third Republic , becoming Prime Minister in 1912 and serving as President of the Republic from 1913 to 1920 . He purged the French government of all opponents and critics and single-handedly controlled French foreign policy from 1912 to the beginning of World War I . He was noted for his strongly anti-German attitudes , shifting the Franco-Russian Alliance from the defensive to the offensive , visiting Russia in 1912 and 1914 to strengthen Franco-Russian relations , and giving France 's support for Russian military mobilization during the July Crisis of 1914 . From 1917 , he exercised less influence as his political rival Georges Clemenceau had become Prime Minister . At the Paris Peace Conference , he favoured Allied occupation of the Rhineland . In 1922 Poincar\u00e9 returned to power as Prime Minister . In 1923 he ordered the Occupation of the Ruhr to enforce payment of German reparations . By this time Poincar\u00e9 was seen , especially in the English-speaking world , as an aggressive figure ( Poincar\u00e9-la-Guerre ) who had helped to cause the war in 1914 and who now favoured punitive anti-German policies . His government was defeated by the Cartel des Gauches at the elections of 1924 .",

  "/wiki/English_language": "English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and eventually became a global lingua franca . It is named after the Angles , one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name , as England . Both names derive from Anglia , a peninsula in the Baltic Sea . The language is closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon , and its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages , particularly Norse ( a North Germanic language ) , and to a greater extent by Latin and French . English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . The earliest forms of English , a group of West Germanic ( Ingvaeonic ) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century , are collectively called Old English . Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England ; this was a period in which the language was influenced by French . Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London , the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift . Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States . Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science , navigation and law . English is the largest language by number of speakers , and the third most-spoken native language in the world , after Standard Chinese and Spanish . It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states ."
