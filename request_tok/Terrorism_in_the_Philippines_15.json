It was the only region that had its own government . The region 's de facto seat of government was Cotabato City , although this self-governing city was outside its jurisdiction . The ARMM included the province of Shariff Kabunsuan from its creation in 2006 until 16 July 2008 , when Shariff Kabunsuan ceased to exist as a province after the Supreme Court of the Philippines declared the Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act 201 , which created it , unconstitutional in Sema vs. COMELEC . On October 7 , 2012 , President Benigno Aquino III said that the government aimed to have peace in the autonomous region and that it would become known as the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region , a compound of bangsa ( nation ) and Moro . On July 26 , 2018 , Aquino 's successor , President Rodrigo Duterte , signed the Bangsamoro Organic Law ( BOL ) , which paved the way for the establishment of a new autonomous political entity in the area , the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao ( BARMM ) . ARMM was nominally disestablished after the ratification of BOL and will be effectively replaced by the BARMM upon the constitution of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority , an interim government for the region . The law was deemed ratified on January 25 , 2019 following the January 21 plebiscite .",

  "/wiki/Rocket-propelled_grenade": "A rocket-propelled grenade ( often abbreviated RPG ) is a shoulder-fired anti-tank weapon system that fires rockets equipped with an explosive warhead . Most RPGs can be carried by an individual soldier . These warheads are affixed to a rocket motor which propels the RPG towards the target and they are stabilized in flight with fins . Some types of RPG are reloadable with new rocket-propelled grenades , while others are single-use . RPGs , with some exceptions , are generally loaded from the muzzle . RPGs with high explosive anti-tank warheads ( HEAT ) are very effective against armored vehicles such as armored personnel carriers ( APCs ) . However , heavily armored vehicles from the 2010s , such as main battle tanks , are generally too well armored ( with thick composite and/or reactive armor ) to be penetrated by an RPG , unless less armored sections of vehicle are exploited . Various warheads are also capable of causing secondary damage to vulnerable systems ( especially sights , tracks , rear and roof of turrets ) and other unarmored targets . The term rocket-propelled grenade is , strictly speaking , a backronym ; it stems from the Russian language \u0420\u041f\u0413 or \u0440\u0443\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0451\u0442 ( transliterated as ruchnoy protivotankovy granatomyot ) , meaning hand-held anti-tank grenade launcher , the name given to early Russian designs .",

It is based in and around Jolo and Basilan islands in the southwestern part of the Philippines , where for more than four decades , Moro groups have been engaged in an insurgency seeking to make the province independent . The group is considered violent and was responsible for the Philippines ' worst terrorist attack , the bombing of Superferry 14 in 2004 , which killed 116 people . The name of the group is derived from the Arabic abu ( Arabic : \u0623\u0628\u0648 ) ( father of ) , and sayyaf ( Arabic : \u0633\u064a\u0651\u0627\u0641 ) ( swordsmith ) .

Since its inception in 1989 , the group has carried out bombings , kidnappings , assassinations and extortion . They have been involved in criminal activities , including kidnapping , rape , child sexual assault , forced marriage , drive-by shootings , extortion and drug trafficking . The goals of the group appear to have alternated over time between criminal objectives and a more ideological intent . The group has been designated as a terrorist group by Australia , Canada , Indonesia , Japan , Malaysia , the Philippines , United Arab Emirates , the United Kingdom and the United States . From 15 January 2002 - 24 February 2015 , fighting Abu Sayyaf became a mission of the American military 's Operation Enduring Freedom and part of the Global War on Terrorism . Several hundred United States soldiers were stationed in the area to mainly train local forces in counter-terror and counter-guerrilla operations , but , following a status of forces agreement and under Philippine law , they were not allowed to engage in direct combat .",

  "/wiki/Grenade": "A grenade is an explosive weapon typically thrown by hand , but can also refer to projectiles shot out of grenade launchers . Generally , a grenade consists of an explosive charge , a detonating mechanism , and firing pin inside the grenade to trigger the detonating mechanism . Once the soldier throws the grenade , the safety lever releases , the striker throws the safety lever away from the grenade body as it rotates to detonate the primer . The primer explodes and ignites the fuze ( sometimes called the delay element ) . The fuze burns down to the detonator , which explodes the main charge . There are several types of grenades like the fragmentation ( frag ) , high explosive ( HE ) concussion and smoke grenades . Fragmentation grenades are probably the most common in modern armies . They are missiles designed to disperse shrapnel on detonation . The body is generally made of a hard synthetic material or steel , which will provide limited fragmentation through sharding and splintering , though in modern grenades a pre-formed fragmentation matrix inside the grenade is commonly used . The pre-formed fragmentation may be spherical , cuboid , wire or notched wire . Most anti-personnel ( AP ) grenades are designed to detonate either after a time delay or on impact . When the word grenade is used colloquially , it is generally assumed to refer to a fragmentation grenade .",

  "/wiki/Jeepney": "Jeepneys ( Filipino : Dyipni ) , sometimes called simply jeeps ( Filipino : dyip ) , are buses and the most popular means of public transportation ubiquitous in the Philippines . They are known for their crowded seating and kitsch decorations , which have become a wide spread symbol of Philippine culture and art . A Sarao jeepney was exhibited at the Philippine pavilion at the 1964 New York World 's Fair as a national image for the Filipinos . Jeepneys were originally made from U.S. military jeeps left over from World War II . The word jeepney is likely a portmanteau word - a combination of jeep and jitney , both words common slang in the popular vernacular of the era : jitney being a popular term for an American taxicab , and a jeep a newly coined term to describe a type of military vehicle ( origin from General Purpose , or GP , hence Jeep ) . Other sources favor the far less likely explanation that it is a portmanteau of jeep and knee , because the passengers sit very close to each other . Most jeepneys are used as public utility vehicles . Some are used as personal vehicles . Jeepneys are used less often for commercial or institutional use .",
  "/wiki/Police": "The police are a constituted body of persons empowered by a state to enforce the law , to ensure the safety , health and possessions of citizens , and to prevent crime and civil disorder . Their lawful powers include arrest and the legitimized use of force . The term is most commonly associated with the police forces of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility . Police forces are often defined as being separate from the military and other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors ; however , gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing . Police forces are usually public sector services , funded through taxes . Law enforcement is only part of policing activity . Policing has included an array of activities in different situations , but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order . In some societies , in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property . Police forces have become ubiquitous in modern societies . Nevertheless , their role can be controversial , as some are involved to varying degrees in corruption , police brutality and the enforcement of authoritarian rule . A police force may also be referred to as a police department , police service , constabulary , gendarmerie , crime prevention , protective services , law enforcement agency , civil guard or civic guard . Members may be referred to as police officers , troopers , sheriffs , constables , rangers , peace officers or civic/civil guards .",
