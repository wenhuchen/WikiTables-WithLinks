Coconuts are known for their versatility of uses , ranging from food to cosmetics . The inner flesh of the mature seed , as well as the coconut milk extracted from it , forms a regular part of the diets of many people in the tropics and subtropics . Coconuts are distinct from other fruits because their endosperm contains a large quantity of clear liquid , called coconut water or coconut juice . Mature , ripe coconuts can be used as edible seeds , or processed for oil and plant milk from the flesh , charcoal from the hard shell , and coir from the fibrous husk . Dried coconut flesh is called copra , and the oil and milk derived from it are commonly used in cooking - frying in particular - as well as in soaps and cosmetics .

Chinese food staples such as rice , soy sauce , noodles , tea , and tofu , and utensils such as chopsticks and the wok , can now be found worldwide . The preference for seasoning and cooking techniques of Chinese provinces depend on differences in historical background and ethnic groups . Geographic features including mountains , rivers , forests and deserts also have a strong effect on the local available ingredients , considering that the climate of China varies from tropical in the south to subarctic in the northeast . Imperial , royal and noble preference also plays a role in the change of Chinese cuisines . Because of imperial expansion and trading , ingredients and cooking techniques from other cultures are integrated into Chinese cuisines over time .

Ginger originated in Island Southeast Asia and was likely domesticated first by the Austronesian peoples . It was transported with them throughout the Indo-Pacific during the Austronesian expansion ( c. 5,000 BP ) , reaching as far as Hawaii . Ginger is one of the first spices to have been exported from Asia , arriving in Europe with the spice trade , and was used by ancient Greeks and Romans .

The resulting drink is transparent and ranges from pale to bright yellow in color , with a floral aroma . In Chinese tradition , once a pot of chrysanthemum tea has been drunk , hot water is typically added again to the flowers in the pot ( producing a tea that is slightly less strong ) ; this process is often repeated several times .

  "/wiki/Black_tea": "Black tea is a type of tea that is more oxidized than oolong , green , and white teas . Black tea is generally stronger in flavor than other teas . All four types are made from leaves of the shrub ( or small tree ) Camellia sinensis . Two principal varieties of the species are used - the small-leaved Chinese variety plant ( C. sinensis var . sinensis ) , used for most other types of teas , and the large-leaved Assamese plant ( C. sinensis var . assamica ) , which was traditionally mainly used for black tea , although in recent years some green and white teas have been produced . In China , where black tea was discovered , the beverage is called red tea due to the color of the oxidized leaves when processed appropriately . While green tea usually loses its flavor within a year , black tea retains its flavor for several years . For this reason , it has long been an article of trade , and compressed bricks of black tea even served as a form of de facto currency in Mongolia , Tibet and Siberia into the 19th century .

SCM is a very thick , sweet product , which when canned can last for years without refrigeration if not opened . The product is used in numerous dessert dishes in many countries . A related product is evaporated milk , which has undergone a lengthier preservation process because it is not sweetened . Evaporated milk is known in some countries as unsweetened condensed milk . Both products have a similar amount of water removed .",
  "/wiki/Evaporated_milk": "Evaporated milk , known in some countries as unsweetened condensed milk , is a shelf-stable canned cow 's milk product where about 60% of the water has been removed from fresh milk . It differs from sweetened condensed milk , which contains added sugar . Sweetened condensed milk requires less processing to preserve since the added sugar inhibits bacterial growth . The production process involves the evaporation of 60% of the water from the milk , followed by homogenization , canning , and heat-sterilization . Evaporated milk takes up half the space of its nutritional equivalent in fresh milk . When the liquid product is mixed with a proportionate amount of water ( 150% ) , evaporated milk becomes the rough equivalent of fresh milk . This makes evaporated milk attractive for some purposes as it can have a shelf life of months or even years , depending upon the fat and sugar content . This made evaporated milk very popular before refrigeration as a safe and reliable substitute for perishable fresh milk , as it could be shipped easily to locations lacking the means of safe milk production or storage .",
