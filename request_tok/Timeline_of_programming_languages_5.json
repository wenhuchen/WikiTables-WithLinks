Meyer conceived the language in 1985 with the goal of increasing the reliability of commercial software development ; the first version becoming available in 1986 . In 2005 , Eiffel became an ISO-standardized language . The design of the language is closely connected with the Eiffel programming method . Both are based on a set of principles , including design by contract , command-query separation , the uniform-access principle , the single-choice principle , the open-closed principle , and option-operand separation . Many concepts initially introduced by Eiffel later found their way into Java , C # , and other languages . New language design ideas , particularly through the Ecma/ISO standardization process , continue to be incorporated into the Eiffel language .",

  "/wiki/J_(programming_language)": "The J programming language , developed in the early 1990s by Kenneth E. Iverson and Roger Hui , is an array programming language based primarily on APL ( also by Iverson ) . To avoid repeating the APL special-character problem , J uses only the basic ASCII character set , resorting to the use of the dot and colon as inflections to form short words similar to digraphs . Most such primary ( or primitive ) J words serve as mathematical symbols , with the dot or colon extending the meaning of the basic characters available . Also , many characters which in other languages often must be paired ( such as [ ] { } `` or < > ) are treated by J as stand-alone words or , when inflected , as single-character roots of multi-character words . J is a very terse array programming language , and is most suited to mathematical and statistical programming , especially when performing operations on matrices . It has also been used in extreme programming and network performance analysis . Like John Backus 's languages FP and FL , J supports function-level programming via its tacit programming features . Unlike most languages that support object-oriented programming , J 's flexible hierarchical namespace scheme ( where every name exists in a specific locale ) can be effectively used as a framework for both class-based and prototype-based object-oriented programming . Since March 2011 , J is free and open-source software under the GNU General Public License version 3 ( GPLv3 ) . One may also purchase source under a negotiated license .",

The language has expanded significantly over time , and modern C++ has object-oriented , generic , and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation . It is almost always implemented as a compiled language , and many vendors provide C++ compilers , including the Free Software Foundation , LLVM , Microsoft , Intel , Oracle , and IBM , so it is available on many platforms . C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded , resource-constrained software and large systems , with performance , efficiency , and flexibility of use as its design highlights . C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts , with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications , including desktop applications , video games , servers ( e.g . e-commerce , Web search , or SQL servers ) , and performance-critical applications ( e.g . telephone switches or space probes ) . C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) , with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as ISO/IEC 14882:2017 ( informally known as C++17 ) . The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998 , which was then amended by the C++03 , C++11 and C++14 standards .

  "/wiki/Oberon-2_(programming_language)": "Oberon-2 is an extension of the original Oberon programming language that adds limited reflection and object-oriented programming facilities , open arrays as pointer base types , read-only field export and reintroduces the FOR loop from Modula-2 . It was developed in 1991 at ETH Zurich by Niklaus Wirth and Hanspeter M\u00f6ssenb\u00f6ck , who is now at Institut f\u00fcr Systemsoftware ( SSW ) of the University of Linz , Austria . Oberon-2 is a superset of Oberon , and is fully compatible with it . Oberon-2 was a redesign of Object Oberon . Oberon-2 inherited limited reflection and single inheritance ( type extension ) without interfaces or mixins from Oberon , but added efficient virtual methods ( type bound procedures ) . Method calls were resolved at run-time using C++-style virtual method tables . Compared to fully object-oriented programming languages like Smalltalk , in Oberon-2 basic types are not objects , classes are not objects , many operations are not methods , there is no message passing ( to a certain extent it can be emulated by reflection and through message extension , as demonstrated in ETH Oberon ) , and polymorphism is limited to subclasses of a common class ( no duck typing like in Python , and it 's not possible to define interfaces like in Java ) . Oberon-2 does not support encapsulation at object/class level , but modules can be used for this purpose . Reflection in Oberon-2 does not use meta-objects , but simply reads from type descriptors compiled into the executable binaries , and exposed in the modules that define the types and/or procedures . If the format of these structures are exposed at the language level ( as is the case for ETH Oberon , for example ) , reflection could be implemented at the library level . It could therefore be implemented almost entirely at library level , without changing the language code . Indeed , ETH Oberon makes use of language-level and library-level reflection capabilities extensively .",

At the same time , Pure is a small language designed from scratch ; its interpreter is not large , and the library modules are written in Pure . The syntax of Pure resembles that of Miranda and Haskell , but it is a free-format language and thus uses explicit delimiters ( rather than off-side rule indents ) to denote program structure . The Pure language is a successor of the equational programming language Q , previously created by the same author , Albert Gr\u00e4f at the University of Mainz , Germany . Relative to Q , it offers some important new features ( such as local functions with lexical scoping , efficient vector and matrix support , and the built-in C interface ) and programs run much faster as they are compiled just-in-time to native code on the fly . Pure is mostly aimed at mathematical applications and scientific computing currently , but its interactive interpreter environment , the C interface and the growing set of addon modules make it suitable for a variety of other applications , such as artificial intelligence , symbolic computation , and real-time multimedia processing .
