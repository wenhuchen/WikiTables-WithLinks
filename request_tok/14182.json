  "/wiki/Susquehanna_River": "The Susquehanna River ( /\u02ccs\u028cskw\u0259\u02c8h\u00e6n\u0259/ ; Lenape : Sisk\u00ebwahane ) is a major river located in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic United States . At 444 miles ( 715 km ) long , it is the longest river on the East Coast of the United States that drains into the Chesapeake Bay . With its watershed , it is the 16th-largest river in the United States , and the longest river in the early 21st-century continental United States without commercial boat traffic . The Susquehanna River forms from two main branches : the North Branch , which rises in Cooperstown , New York , and is regarded by federal mapmakers as the main branch or headwaters , and the West Branch , which rises in western Pennsylvania and joins the main branch near Northumberland in central Pennsylvania . The river drains 27,500 square miles ( 71,000 km2 ) , including nearly half of the land area of Pennsylvania . The drainage basin ( watershed ) includes portions of the Allegheny Plateau region of the Appalachian Mountains , cutting through a succession of water gaps in a broad zigzag course to flow across the rural heartland of southeastern Pennsylvania and northeastern Maryland in the lateral near-parallel array of mountain ridges . The river empties into the northern end of the Chesapeake Bay at Perryville and Havre de Grace , Maryland , providing half of the Bay 's freshwater inflow . The Chesapeake Bay is the ria of the Susquehanna .",

  "/wiki/U.S._Route_6": "U.S. Route 6 ( US 6 ) , also called the Grand Army of the Republic Highway , honoring the American Civil War veterans association , is a main route of the U.S. Highway system . While it currently runs east-northeast from Bishop , California to Provincetown , Massachusetts , the route has been modified several times . The highway 's longest-lasting routing , from 1936 to 1964 , had its western terminus at Long Beach , California . During this time , US 6 was the longest highway in the country . In 1964 , the state of California renumbered its highways , and most of the route within California was transferred to other highways . This dropped the highway 's length below that of US 20 . US 6 is a diagonal route , whose number is out of sequence with the rest of the U.S. Highway grid in the western US . When it was designated in 1926 , US 6 only ran east of Erie , Pennsylvania . Subsequent extensions , largely replacing the former U.S. Route 32 ( US 32 ) and US 38 , have taken it south of US 30 at Joliet , Illinois , US 40 near Denver , Colorado ( past the end of US 38 ) , US 50 at Ely , Nevada , and even US 70 near Los Angeles , California , due to its north-south alignment in that state . US 6 does not serve a major transcontinental corridor , unlike other highways . George R. Stewart , author of U.S. 40 : Cross Section of the United States of America , initially considered US 6 , but realized that Route 6 runs uncertainly from nowhere to nowhere , scarcely to be followed from one end to the other , except by some devoted eccentric . In the famous beat novel On the Road by Jack Kerouac , protagonist Sal Paradise actually considers hitchhiking on US 6 to Nevada , but is told by a driver that there 's no traffic passes through 6 and that he 'd be better off going via Pittsburgh ( the Pennsylvania Turnpike ) .",
