Palpatine falsely accuses the Jedi of causing the Clone Wars , a secessionist war , to weaken the Republic and gain power . Palpatine manipulates the Galactic Senate into using clone troopers created during the conflict to kill the Jedi .

The Senate overwhelmingly applauds this decision and lauds Palpatine 's apparent resolve , bravery , and selflessness .",
