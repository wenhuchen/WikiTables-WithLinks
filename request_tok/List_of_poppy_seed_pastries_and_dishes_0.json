Myanmar is bordered by Bangladesh and India to its northwest , China to its northeast , Laos and Thailand to its east and southeast , and the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal to its south and southwest . With a size of 676,578 square kilometres ( 261,228 square miles ) , Myanmar is the largest of the Mainland Southeast Asian states by area . As of 2017 , the population is about 54 million . Its capital city is Naypyidaw , and its largest city is Yangon ( Rangoon ) . Myanmar has been a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) since 1997 . Early civilisations in Myanmar included the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu city-states in Upper Burma and the Mon kingdoms in Lower Burma . In the 9th century , the Bamar people entered the upper Irrawaddy valley and , following the establishment of the Pagan Kingdom in the 1050s , the Burmese language , culture and Theravada Buddhism slowly became dominant in the country . The Pagan Kingdom fell due to the Mongol invasions and several warring states emerged . In the 16th century , reunified by the Taungoo dynasty , the country was for a brief period the largest empire in the history of Mainland Southeast Asia . The early 19th century Konbaung dynasty ruled over an area that included modern Myanmar and briefly controlled Manipur and Assam as well . The British East India Company seized control of the administration of Myanmar after three Anglo-Burmese Wars in the 19th century and the country became a British colony .",
  "/wiki/Pancake": "A pancake ( or hotcake , griddlecake , or flapjack , not to be confused with oat bar flapjacks ) is a flat cake , often thin and round , prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs , milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan , often frying with oil or butter . Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably the earliest and most widespread cereal food eaten in prehistoric societies . The pancake 's shape and structure varies worldwide . In England , pancakes are often unleavened and resemble a cr\u00eape . In North America , a leavening agent is used ( typically baking powder ) creating a thick fluffy pancake . A cr\u00eape is a thin Breton pancake of French origin cooked on one or both sides in a special pan or crepe maker to achieve a lacelike network of fine bubbles . A well-known variation originating from southeast Europe is a pala\u010dinke , a thin moist pancake fried on both sides and filled with jam , cheese cream , chocolate , or ground walnuts , but many other fillings - sweet or savoury - can also be used . When potato is used as a major portion of the batter , the result is a potato pancake . Commercially prepared pancake mixes are available in some countries . When buttermilk is used in place of or in addition to milk , the pancake develops a tart flavor and becomes known as a buttermilk pancake , which is common in Scotland and the US . Buckwheat flour can be used in a pancake batter , making for a type of buckwheat pancake , a category that includes Blini , Kaletez , Ploye , and Memil-buchimgae . Pancakes may be served at any time of the day with a variety of toppings or fillings but in America they are typically considered a breakfast food .",

The majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages , including the Maya and Aztecs . The word chocolate is derived from the Classical Nahuatl word chocol\u0101tl . The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor . After fermentation , the beans are dried , cleaned , and roasted . The shell is removed to produce cacao nibs , which are then ground to cocoa mass , unadulterated chocolate in rough form . Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating , it is called chocolate liquor . The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components : cocoa solids and cocoa butter . Baking chocolate , also called bitter chocolate , contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions , without any added sugar .

Its area is about 40,000 km2 ( 15,400 sq mi ) , and its population about 8,000,000 . Silesia is located along the Oder River . It consists of Lower Silesia and Upper Silesia . The region is rich in mineral and natural resources , and includes several important industrial areas . Silesia 's largest city and historical capital is Wroc\u0142aw . The biggest metropolitan area is the Upper Silesian metropolitan area , the centre of which is Katowice . Parts of the Czech city of Ostrava fall within the borders of Silesia . Silesia 's borders and national affiliation have changed over time , both when it was a hereditary possession of noble houses and after the rise of modern nation-states . The first known states to hold power there were probably those of Greater Moravia at the end of the 9th century and Bohemia early in the 10th century . In the 10th century , Silesia was incorporated into the early Polish state , and after its division in the 12th century became a Piast duchy . In the 14th century , it became a constituent part of the Bohemian Crown Lands under the Holy Roman Empire , which passed to the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy in 1526 .",
  "/wiki/Christmas_Eve": "Christmas Eve is the evening or entire day before Christmas Day , the festival commemorating the birth of Jesus . Christmas Day is observed around the world , and Christmas Eve is widely observed as a full or partial holiday in anticipation of Christmas Day . Together , both days are considered one of the most culturally significant celebrations in Christendom and Western society . Christmas celebrations in the denominations of Western Christianity have long begun on Christmas Eve , due in part to the Christian liturgical day starting at sunset , a practice inherited from Jewish tradition and based on the story of Creation in the Book of Genesis : And there was evening , and there was morning - the first day . Many churches still ring their church bells and hold prayers in the evening ; for example , the Nordic Lutheran churches . Since tradition holds that Jesus was born at night ( based in Luke 2:6-8 ) , Midnight Mass is celebrated on Christmas Eve , traditionally at midnight , in commemoration of his birth . The idea of Jesus being born at night is reflected in the fact that Christmas Eve is referred to as Heilige Nacht ( Holy Night ) in German , Nochebuena ( the Good Night ) in Spanish and similarly in other expressions of Christmas spirituality , such as the song Silent Night , Holy Night . Many other varying cultural traditions and experiences are also associated with Christmas Eve around the world , including the gathering of family and friends , the singing of Christmas carols , the illumination and enjoyment of Christmas lights , trees , and other decorations , the wrapping , exchange and opening of gifts , and general preparation for Christmas Day . Legendary Christmas gift-bearing figures including Santa Claus , Father Christmas , Christkind , and Saint Nicholas are also often said to depart for their annual journey to deliver presents to children around the world on Christmas Eve , although until the Protestant introduction of Christkind in 16th-century Europe , such figures were said to instead deliver presents on the eve of Saint Nicholas ' feast day ( 6 December ) .",
