  "/wiki/Community_radio": "Community radio is a radio service offering a third model of radio broadcasting in addition to commercial and public broadcasting . Community stations serve geographic communities and communities of interest . They broadcast content that is popular and relevant to a local , specific audience but is often overlooked by commercial or mass-media broadcasters . Community radio stations are operated , owned , and influenced by the communities they serve . They are generally nonprofit and provide a mechanism for enabling individuals , groups , and communities to tell their own stories , to share experiences and , in a media-rich world , to become creators and contributors of media . In many parts of the world , community radio acts as a vehicle for the community and voluntary sector , civil society , agencies , NGOs and citizens to work in partnership to further community development aims , in addition to broadcasting . There is legally defined community radio ( as a distinct broadcasting sector ) in many countries , such as France , Argentina , South Africa , Australia and Ireland . Much of the legislation has included phrases such as social benefit , social objectives and social gain as part of the definition . Community radio has developed differently in different countries , and the term has somewhat different meanings in the United Kingdom , Ireland , the United States , Canada and Australia , where freedom of speech laws and de facto realities differ .",

It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire , as did all Romance languages . French evolved from Gallo-Romance , the spoken Latin in Gaul , and more specifically in Northern Gaul . Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders . Today , owing to France 's past overseas expansion , there are numerous French-based creole languages , most notably Haitian Creole . A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French . French is an official language in 29 countries across multiple continents , most of which are members of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie ( OIF ) , the community of 84 countries which share the official use or teaching of French . It is spoken as a first language ( in descending order of the number of speakers ) in France , the Canadian provinces of Quebec , Ontario and New Brunswick as well as other Francophone regions , Belgium ( Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region ) , western Switzerland ( cantons of Bern , Fribourg , Geneva , Jura , Neuch\u00e2tel , Vaud , Valais ) , Monaco , partly in Luxembourg , the states of Louisiana , Maine , New Hampshire and Vermont in the United States , and in northwestern Italy ( region of Aosta Valley ) , and by various communities elsewhere .

Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music . Adult contemporary tends to have lush , soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated . It is usually melodic enough to get a listener 's attention , and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music . Like most of pop music , its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse-chorus structure . The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments ( though bass guitar is usually used ) such as acoustic guitars , pianos , saxophones , and sometimes an orchestral set . The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched . However , recent adult contemporary music may feature synthesizers ( and other electronics , such as drum machines ) . An AC radio station may play mainstream music , but it excludes hip hop , dance tracks , hard rock , and some forms of teen pop , as these are less popular among adults , the target demographic . AC radio often targets the 25-44 age group , the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s . A common practice in recent years of adult contemporary stations is to play less newer music and more hits of the past . This de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart .",

Campus radio stations are generally licensed and regulated by national governments , and have very different characteristics from one country to the next . One commonality between many radio stations regardless of their physical location is a willingness - or , in some countries , even a licensing requirement - to broadcast musical selections that are not categorized as commercial hits . Because of this , campus radio has come to be associated with emerging musical trends , including genres such as punk and new wave , alternative rock , indie rock and hip hop , long before those genres become part of the musical mainstream . Campus radio stations also often provide airplay and promotional exposure to new and emerging local artists .

A number of these radio stations have gained critical acclaim for their programming and are considered by the community in which they are embedded to be an essential media outlet .

The language is closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon , and its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages , particularly Norse ( a North Germanic language ) , and to a greater extent by Latin and French . English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . The earliest forms of English , a group of West Germanic ( Ingvaeonic ) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century , are collectively called Old English . Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England ; this was a period in which the language was influenced by French . Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London , the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift . Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States . Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science , navigation and law .

In addition , adult hits stations tend to have larger playlists , playing a given song only a few times per week , compared to the tighter libraries on classic hits stations . For example , KRTH , a classic hits station in Los Angeles , plays power songs up to 30 times a week , which is another differentiator compared to other formats that share songs with classic hits libraries .

Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music . Adult contemporary tends to have lush , soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated . It is usually melodic enough to get a listener 's attention , and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music . Like most of pop music , its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse-chorus structure . The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments ( though bass guitar is usually used ) such as acoustic guitars , pianos , saxophones , and sometimes an orchestral set . The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched . However , recent adult contemporary music may feature synthesizers ( and other electronics , such as drum machines ) . An AC radio station may play mainstream music , but it excludes hip hop , dance tracks , hard rock , and some forms of teen pop , as these are less popular among adults , the target demographic . AC radio often targets the 25-44 age group , the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s . A common practice in recent years of adult contemporary stations is to play less newer music and more hits of the past . This de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart .",
  "/wiki/CFOM-FM": "CFOM-FM is a French-language Canadian radio station located in Quebec City , Quebec , licensed to Levis . The station has a hot adult contemporary format since August 2014 . Owned and operated by Cogeco , it broadcasts on 102.9 MHz using a directional antenna with an average effective radiated power of 16,800 watts and a peak effective radiated power of 32,800 watts ( class C1 ) . The station 's transmitter is located at Mount B\u00e9lair . It used to be an AM station , broadcast at 1240 AM from its inception in December 1967 until 1976 , then moved to 920 AM until 1994 and was originally known as CFLS . In 1988 , CFLS 's then-owner , Radio Etchemin , planned to relocate CFLS from 920 kHz to the FM band at 106.3 MHz , with effective radiated power of 54,350 watts ; this application would be denied by the CRTC . ( 106.3 has since been occupied by the local Ici Radio-Canada Premi\u00e8re outlet , CBV-FM . ) CFLS 's second application to relocate to FM , this time to 102.9 MHz , was successful , and the relocation was made in 1994 . When the station switched to an oldies format in 1995 , it changed its call sign to the current CFOM-FM . Ironically , CFLS was Quebec City 's Top 40 station in the 1970s and early 1980s and had to compete , until 1976 , against an English-language Top 40 station known as CFOM , which was closed by order of the CRTC for failure to respect CBC Radio affiliation requirements . That station began operating in 1949 under the call letters CJNT until 1954 when the call letters were changed to CJQC and were again changed in 1964 to become CFOM , at 1340 on the dial . In March 2009 , then-owner Corus Entertainment expanded CFOM-FM 's Souvenirs Garantis format ( which was introduced on CFOM in 2005 ) to CHLT-FM in Sherbrooke , CJRC-FM in Gatineau , CHLN-FM in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res and CKRS-FM in Saguenay - replacing their long-time news-talk formats on these stations .",
  "/wiki/Oldies": "Oldies is a radio format that concentrates on rock and roll and pop music from the second half of the twentieth century , specifically from around the mid-1950s to the 1970s or 1980s . In the 1980s and 1990s , oldies meant the 15 years from the birth of rock and roll to the beginning of the singer-songwriter era of the early 1970s , or about 1955-1972 , although this time frame varied and some stations chose 1950-1969 . [ citation needed ] After 2000 , 1970s music was increasingly included , and early 1980s music is beginning to also be called oldies , though the term classic hits is used to distinguish the new oldies ( the Generation X oldies ) from the old oldies ( the Baby Boomer oldies ) .",

CITF-FM started operations on July 22 , 1982 as a sister station to the now-defunct CKCV 1280 with a beautiful music format . The latter closed in September 1990 , as part of a failed attempt of Telemedia ( then owner of both stations ) to buy CHRC 800 , as at the time owners were limited to only one AM station and one FM station per market . ( Even though the purchase of CKCV was denied by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) , that station remained dark . ) Up until 1990 , CITF-FM had a beautiful music format .

  "/wiki/Rouge_FM": "Rouge FM is a network of French-language adult contemporary radio stations broadcasting throughout Quebec , Canada . Established in 1990 as RockD\u00e9tente , they are owned by Bell Media . All Rouge FM stations broadcast in the same markets as Bell 's contemporary hit radio network , \u00c9nergie , although \u00c9nergie also has a few stations in markets not served by Rouge FM . Although the stations concentrate on French adult contemporary music , it would mix in English music as well , much like Cogeco 's Rythme FM network , which has fewer stations than Rouge FM . The flagship radio station is Montreal 's CITE-FM . The Astral jingles on this network are different from the adult hits jingles used by Astral 's English-language adult contemporary stations , nut the network uses a very relaxing acoustic tune . On August 18 , 2011 , at 4:00 p.m. EDT , all RockD\u00e9tente stations were rebranded as Rouge FM , when the longtime RockD\u00e9tente branding was retired after a 21-year run . On most stations , the last song as RockD\u00e9tente was Pour que tu m'aimes encore by Celine Dion , followed by a tribute of the branding . The first song under Rouge FM was I Got ta Feeling by Black Eyed Peas . After rebranding , most of the soft rock songs were dropped , leaving the Rythme FM network to continue broadcasting them and moving Rouge FM towards a hot adult contemporary direction . By 2012 , most of the classic hits and ballads returned due to the 35th anniversary of flagship CITE-FM Montreal , going towards its old RockD\u00e9tente direction . From May 2011 to March 2012 , the stations started identifying their call letters during station identification , and in April 27 to 29 , 2012 , the network was briefly rebranded Rose FM as a charitable promotion for breast cancer research .",
