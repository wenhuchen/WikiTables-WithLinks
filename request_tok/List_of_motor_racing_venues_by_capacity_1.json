  "/wiki/Grand_Prix_motor_racing": "Grand Prix motor racing , a form of motorsport competition , has its roots in organised automobile racing that began in France as early as 1894 . It quickly evolved from simple road races from one town to the next , to endurance tests for car and driver . Innovation and the drive of competition soon saw speeds exceeding 100 miles per hour ( 160 km/h ) , but because early races took place on open roads , accidents occurred frequently , resulting in deaths both of drivers and of spectators . Grand Prix motor racing eventually evolved into formula racing , and one can regard Formula One as its direct descendant . Each event of the Formula One World Championships is still called a Grand Prix ; Formula One is also referred to as Grand Prix racing .",
  "/wiki/Ontario_Motor_Speedway": "Ontario Motor Speedway was a motorsport venue located in Ontario , California . It was the first and only automobile racing facility built to accommodate major races sanctioned by all of the four dominant racing sanctioning bodies : USAC ( and now IndyCar Series ) for open-wheel oval car races ; NASCAR for a 500-mile ( 800 km ) oval stock car races ; NHRA for drag races ; and FIA for Formula One road course races . Constructed in less than two years , the track opened in August 1970 and was considered state of the art at the time . The first full year of racing included the Indy-style open wheel Inaugural California 500 on September 6 , 1970 ; the Miller High Life 500 stock car race on February 28 , 1971 , the NHRA Super Nationals drag race on November 21 , 1970 and the Questor Grand Prix on March 28 , 1971 . Each of these inaugural races drew attendance second only to their established counterparts , the USAC Indianapolis 500 , the NASCAR Daytona 500 , the NHRA U.S. Nationals , and the U.S . Formula One race at Watkins Glen . The track was purchased for real estate development by Chevron Land Company in late 1980 and demolished at a cost of $ 3 million in 1981 . It is estimated that the 800-acre ( 3.2 km2 ) facility , with 155,000 permanent seats and an air-conditioned private stadium club would have a replacement cost in 2009 of over $ 350 million .

Part of the city has been designated as a World Heritage Site , named Rio de Janeiro : Carioca Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea , by UNESCO on 1 July 2012 as a Cultural Landscape . Founded in 1565 by the Portuguese , the city was initially the seat of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro , a domain of the Portuguese Empire . Later , in 1763 , it became the capital of the State of Brazil , a state of the Portuguese Empire . In 1808 , when the Portuguese Royal Court transferred itself from Portugal to Brazil , Rio de Janeiro became the chosen seat of the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal , who subsequently , in 1815 , under the leadership of her son , the Prince Regent , and future King Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal , raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom , within the United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil , and Algarves . Rio stayed the capital of the pluricontinental Lusitanian monarchy until 1822 , when the War of Brazilian Independence began . This is one of the few instances in history that the capital of a colonising country officially shifted to a city in one of its colonies . Rio de Janeiro subsequently served as the capital of the independent monarchy , the Empire of Brazil , until 1889 , and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960 when the capital was transferred to Bras\u00edlia .

  "/wiki/Champ_Car": "Championship Auto Racing Teams ( CART ) was a sanctioning body for American open-wheel car racing that operated from 1979 to 2003 . It sanctioned the PPG Indy Car World Series from 1979 until dissolving after the 2003 season . CART was founded in 1979 by United States Auto Club ( USAC ) Championship Division team owners who disagreed with the direction and leadership of USAC , with the then-novel idea of car owners sanctioning and promoting their own series collectively instead of relying on a neutral body to do so . Through the 1980s , the Indy Car World Series became the pre-eminent open-wheel auto racing series in North America , featuring street circuits , road courses , and oval track racing . CART drivers continued to compete at the USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 . Even as the series prospered , concerns about costs , competitiveness , and revenue sharing began to create opposition to CART 's organizational structure . Attempts at reform , which saw the company rebranded as IndyCar in 1992 and a compromise board formed , failed . In 1996 , an open wheel split saw the newly created Indy Racing League ( IRL ) take full control over the Indianapolis 500 and start a competing oval-based open-wheel series . CART ceased using the IndyCar name but continued its series without participating in the Indianapolis 500 . The split saw a dramatic fall in general interest for open wheel racing in the United States , which was compounded by the growing popularity of NASCAR , creating a downward trend in sponsorship and attendance at some tracks . After a series of setbacks in the early 2000s saw the departure of major racing teams and engine manufacturers to the IRL , CART went bankrupt at the end of the 2003 season . In 2004 , a trio of team owners acquired the assets of the series from bankruptcy , renaming the series Champ Car .",

It is the oldest established motorsport world championship . The current top division is known as MotoGP since 2002 when the four-stroke era began . Prior to that , the largest class was 500cc , both of which form a historical continuum as the official World Championship , although all classes have official status . Grand Prix motorcycles are purpose-built racing machines that are generally unavailable for purchase by the general public or able to be ridden legally on public roads . This contrasts with the various production-based categories of racing , such as the Superbike World Championship and the Isle of Man TT Races that feature modified versions of road-going motorcycles available to the public . The championship is currently divided into four classes : Moto Grand Prix , Moto2 , Moto3 and MotoE . The first three classes use four-stroke engines , while the MotoE class ( new in 2019 ) uses electric motors , much like the four-wheeler , single-seater all-electric racing series Formula E. The 2019 MotoGP season comprises 19 Grands Prix , with 12 held in Europe , three in Asia , two in the Americas , and one each in Australia and the Middle East . The most successful rider in Grand Prix history is Giacomo Agostini with 15 titles and 122 race wins . In the top-flight series , Agostini holds the title record with eight , followed by active riders Valentino Rossi with seven and Marc M\u00e1rquez with six .

It is fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south , the Pennines to the north and east , and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation . The local authority for the city is Manchester City Council . The recorded history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort of Mamucium or Mancunium , which was established in about AD 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell . It is historically a part of Lancashire , although areas of Cheshire south of the River Mersey were incorporated in the 20th century . The first to be included , Wythenshawe , was added to the city in 1931 . Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township , but began to expand at an astonishing rate around the turn of the 19th century . Manchester 's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution , and resulted in it becoming the world 's first industrialised city . Manchester achieved city status in 1853 . The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894 , creating the Port of Manchester and directly linking the city to the Irish Sea , 36 miles ( 58 km ) to the west . Its fortune declined after the Second World War , owing to deindustrialisation , but the IRA bombing in 1996 led to extensive investment and regeneration .",

Competitors use this surface to slide their machines sideways , powersliding or broadsiding into the bends . On the straight sections of the track the motorcycles reach speeds of up to 70 miles per hour ( 110 km/h ) . There are now both domestic and international competitions in a number of countries including the Speedway World Cup whilst the highest overall scoring individual in the Speedway Grand Prix events is pronounced the world champion .
