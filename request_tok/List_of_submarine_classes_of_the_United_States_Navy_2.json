  "/wiki/V-boat": "The V-boats were a group of nine United States Navy submarines built between World War I and World War II from 1921 to 1934 . These were not a ship class in the usual sense of a series of nearly identical ships built from the same design , but shared authorization under the fleet boat program . The term V-boats as used includes five separate classes of submarines . They broke down into three large , fast fleet submarines ( V-1 through V-3 ) , three large long-range submarines ( V-4 through V-6 ) , and three medium-sized submarines ( V-7 through V-9 ) . The successful fleet submarines of World War II ( Tambor class through Tench class ) were descended from the last three , especially V-7 , though somewhat larger with pure diesel-electric propulsion systems . Originally called USS V-1 through V-9 ( SS-163 through SS-171 ) , in 1931 the nine submarines were renamed Barracuda , Bass , Bonita , Argonaut , Narwhal , Nautilus , Dolphin , Cachalot , and Cuttlefish , respectively .

  "/wiki/Cachalot-class_submarine": "The Cachalot-class submarines were a pair of medium-sized submarines of the United States Navy built under the tonnage limits of the London Naval Treaty of 1930 . They were originally named V-8 and V-9 , and so were known as V-boats even though they were unrelated to the other seven submarines ( V-1 through V-7 ) constructed between World War I and World War II . An extensive study was conducted to determine the optimum submarine size under the treaty restrictions , factoring in total force , endurance , and percentage of the force that could be maintained on station far from a base , as in a Pacific war scenario . Joseph W. Paige of the Navy 's Bureau of Construction and Repair ( BuC & R ) developed the basic design , but the builder , Electric Boat , was responsible for detailed arrangement ; this was fairly bold , since EB had not built any new submarines since finishing four obsolescent boats for Peru . The previous V-boats were all built in naval shipyards . Cuttlefish was the first submarine built at EB 's facility in Groton , Connecticut ; construction of previous Electric Boat designs had been subcontracted to other shipyards , notably Fore River Shipbuilding of Quincy , Massachusetts .",

Also , their 11,000 nautical miles ( 20,000 km ) unrefueled range would allow them to operate in Japanese home waters .

It was the USN 's first fully successful fleet submarine , and began the war close to the fighting . Six of the class were in Hawaiian waters or the Central Pacific on 7 December 1941 , with Tautog at Pearl Harbor during the attack . They went on to see hard service ; seven of the twelve boats in the class were sunk before the survivors were withdrawn from front-line service in early 1945 ; this was the highest percentage lost of any US submarine class . Tautog was credited with sinking 26 ships , the largest number of ships sunk by a US submarine in World War II . The Tambors attained the top speed of 21 knots ( 39 km/h ) and range of 11,000 nautical miles ( 20,000 km ) ( allowing patrols in Japanese home waters ) of the preceding Sargo class , and improvements included six bow torpedo tubes , a more reliable full diesel-electric propulsion plant , and improved combat efficiency with key personnel and equipment relocated to the conning tower .

The two submarines were similar in size and capability to the S-class submarines built at the end of World War I , and had been ordered to test the feasibility of using mass production techniques to build small submarines . Until at least 1940 it was thought that mass production of fleet submarines would be impractical , and in any case small submarines could provide area defense for submarine bases . Once it became apparent that there would be sufficient production of the more capable Gato-class submarines , interest in the design waned and no additional small submarines were ordered . Submarine production standardized during the war on the Gato class and its successors , the Balao and Tench-class submarines . In some references , the Mackerels are called the M class .",

She arrived the next day for duty with TG 27.1 , training new escort vessels in antisubmarine warfare . She returned to New London 18 April , and operated in Long Island Sound through 1942 . On 7 January 1943 the submarine arrived in Casco Bay for further duty with TG 27.1 until 16 January . She then spent the next 2\u00bd years patrolling and training ships off New London and Portsmouth , New Hampshire .

Together with their near-sisters the Balao and Tench classes , their design formed the majority of the United States Navy 's World War II submarine fleet . Named after the lead ship of the class , USS Gato , the Gatos and their successors formed the core of the submarine service that was largely responsible for the destruction of the Japanese merchant marine and a large portion of the Imperial Japanese Navy in World War II . Gato 's name comes from a species of small catshark . Like most other U.S. Navy submarines of the period , boats of the Gato class were given the names of marine creatures .
