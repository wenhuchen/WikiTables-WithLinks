It was the result of a confluence of external and internal causes in what was then a Portuguese colony . The external inspiration was the independence of thirteen of the British colonies in North America following the American Revolutionary War , a development that impressed the intellectual elite of particularly the captaincy of Minas Gerais . The main internal cause of the conspiracy was the decline of gold mining in that captaincy . As gold became less plentiful , the region 's gold miners faced increasing difficulties in fulfilling tax obligations to the crown , the tax over gold was one-fifth . When the captaincy could not satisfy the royal demand for gold , it was burdened with an additional tax on gold , called derrama . Conspirators seeking independence from Portugal planned to rise up in rebellion on the day that the derrama was instituted . However , the conspirators lacked both well-formed plans and an overall leader . Some of the conspirators were republicans , others were monarchists . Some favored the abolition of slavery , while others judged abolition as impractical at that time . The conspirators did put forth a few economic and social ideas : the promotion of cotton production , the exploitation of iron and saltpeter reserves , a proposal to give incentives to mothers to have many children , and the creation of a citizens ' militia . The conspiracy attracted a great number of military personnel , priests , and intellectuals , as well as the poets Cl\u00e1udio Manuel da Costa and Tom\u00e1s Ant\u00f4nio Gonzaga ( 1744-1807 ?",

  "/wiki/Empire_of_Brazil": "The Empire of Brazil was a 19th-century state that broadly comprised the territories which form modern Brazil and ( until 1828 ) Uruguay . Its government was a representative parliamentary constitutional monarchy under the rule of Emperors Dom Pedro I and his son Dom Pedro II . A colony of the Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil became the seat of the Portuguese colonial Empire in 1808 , when the Portuguese Prince regent , later King Dom Jo\u00e3o VI , fled from Napoleon 's invasion of Portugal and established himself and his government in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro . Jo\u00e3o VI later returned to Portugal , leaving his eldest son and heir , Pedro , to rule the Kingdom of Brazil as regent . On 7 September 1822 , Pedro declared the independence of Brazil and , after waging a successful war against his father 's kingdom , was acclaimed on 12 October as Pedro I , the first Emperor of Brazil . The new country was huge , sparsely populated and ethnically diverse . Unlike most of the neighboring Hispanic American republics , Brazil had political stability , vibrant economic growth , constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech , and respect for civil rights of its subjects , albeit with legal restrictions on women and slaves , the latter regarded as property and not citizens . The empire 's bicameral parliament was elected under comparatively democratic methods for the era , as were the provincial and local legislatures . This led to a long ideological conflict between Pedro I and a sizable parliamentary faction over the role of the monarch in the government . He faced other obstacles . The unsuccessful Cisplatine War against the neighboring United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata in 1828 led to the secession of the province of Cisplatina ( later to become Uruguay ) . In 1826 , despite his role in Brazilian independence , he became the king of Portugal ; he immediately abdicated the Portuguese throne in favor of his eldest daughter .",

At 8.5 million square kilometers ( 3.2 million square miles ) and with over 211 million people , Brazil is the world 's fifth-largest country by area and the sixth most populous . Its capital is Bras\u00edlia , and its most populous city is S\u00e3o Paulo . The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states , the Federal District , and the 5,570 municipalities . It is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas ; it is also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations , due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world . Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east , Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers ( 4,655 mi ) . It borders all other countries in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent 's land area . Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest , home to diverse wildlife , a variety of ecological systems , and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats . This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries , and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection .

  "/wiki/Christmas": "Christmas ( or Feast of the Nativity ) is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ , observed primarily on December 25 [ a ] as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world . A feast central to the Christian liturgical year , it is preceded by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide , which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night ; in some traditions , Christmastide includes an octave . Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world 's nations , is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians , as well as culturally by many non-Christians , and forms an integral part of the holiday season centered around it . The traditional Christmas narrative , the Nativity of Jesus , delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem , in accordance with messianic prophecies . When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city , the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born , with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then further disseminated the information . Although the month and date of Jesus ' birth are unknown , the church in the early fourth century fixed the date as December 25 . This corresponds to the date of the winter solstice on the Roman calendar . Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar , which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world . However , part of the Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar , which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar . For Christians , believing that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity , rather than knowing Jesus ' exact birth date , is considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas . The celebratory customs associated in various countries with Christmas have a mix of pre-Christian , Christian , and secular themes and origins . Popular modern customs of the holiday include gift giving ; completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath ; Christmas music and caroling ; viewing a Nativity play ; an exchange of Christmas cards ; church services ; a special meal ; and the display of various Christmas decorations , including Christmas trees , Christmas lights , nativity scenes , garlands , wreaths , mistletoe , and holly .",
  "/wiki/Nativity_of_Jesus": "The nativity of Jesus , nativity of Christ , birth of Christ or birth of Jesus is described in the Biblical gospels of Luke and Matthew . The two accounts agree that Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea , his mother Mary was betrothed to a man named Joseph , who was descended from King David and was not his biological father , and that his birth was caused by divine intervention . The nativity is the basis for the Christian holiday of Christmas on December 25 , and plays a major role in the Christian liturgical year . Many Christians traditionally display small manger scenes depicting the nativity in their homes , or attend Nativity Plays or Christmas pageants focusing on the nativity cycle in the Bible . Elaborate nativity displays called creche scenes , featuring life-sized statues , are a tradition in many continental European countries during the Christmas season . Christian congregations of the Western tradition ( including the Catholic Church , the Western Rite Orthodox , the Anglican Communion , and many other Protestants , such as the Moravian Church ) begin observing the season of Advent four Sundays before Christmas . Christians of the Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodox Church observe a similar season , sometimes called Advent but also called the Nativity Fast , which begins forty days before Christmas . Some Eastern Orthodox Christians ( e.g . Greeks and Syrians ) celebrate Christmas on December 25 . Other Orthodox ( e.g . Copts , Ethiopians , Georgians , and Russians ) celebrate Christmas on ( the Gregorian ) January 7 ( Koiak 29 on the Coptic calendar ) as a result of their churches continuing to follow the Julian calendar , rather than the modern day Gregorian calendar . The artistic depiction of the nativity has been an important subject for Christian artists since the 4th century ."
