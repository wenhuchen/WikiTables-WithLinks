  "/wiki/Bobo_Dioulasso": "At the end of the nineteenth century , Sia consisted of two large villages , Tunuma and Sia proper , located a few hundred meters from each other on a narrow spit of land bounded by 10-to-15-foot-deep ( 3.0-4.6-metre ) ravines on either side , carved by the We ( Hou\u00ebt ) river to the east and by its tributary Sanyo to the west . Three small satellite villages were located beyond this natural border . A number of other independent villages in the surroundings ( Bindogoso , Dogona , Kwirima , Kpa ) have been absorbed by the developing city and are now within its municipal boundaries and incorporated as part of the city . The two main villages were occupied by the French on September 25 , 1897 after a brief but bloody confrontation . Soon afterward the French created an administrative settlement near them , on the east side of the We river . This became the headquarters of a district ( cercle ) of the same name , Bobo-Dioulasso . During the 1915-16 anti-colonial war , the population in the north and east of district Bobo-Dioulasso took up arms against the French colonial government . The French based their activities in the city in an effort to suppress the insurrection , while the city itself became a center for the organization of the suppression . [ pages needed ] A colonial military base was established in the southern sector of the city , adding to its growing importance . In 1927 the French razed the old village of Tunuma and the other settlements ; their population was relocated either to neighboring villages or to a previously farmed empty zone 3 kilometres ( 1.9 miles ) away .
