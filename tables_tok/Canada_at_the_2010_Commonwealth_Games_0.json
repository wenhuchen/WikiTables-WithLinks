  "intro": "Canada competed in the 2010 Commonwealth Games which were held in Delhi, India from October 3-14, 2010. Canada competed in 15 out of 17 sports with the exceptions being netball (team did not qualify) and tennis (scheduling conflicts). Canada's team consisted of 251 athletes, which was a decrease of 3 from the 2006 games. However, the events at these games were much more than they were in 2006. Several athletes withdrew due to safety concerns, including medal contenders Priscilla Lopes-Schliep, Perdita Felician and Dietmar Trillus. Ken Pereira, Captain of the Men's field hockey team, was named the flag bearer on September 18, 2010, becoming the first Indo-Canadian and field hockey player to receive the honour."
