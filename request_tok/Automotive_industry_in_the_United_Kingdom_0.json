The series is currently in its fifth iteration ( or generation , according to the manufacturer ) , the first of which was introduced in 1989 , making the Discovery the first new model series since the launch of the 1970 Range Rover - on which it was based - and only the third new product line since the conception of the Land Rover ( vehicle and brand ) by Rover in 1948 . The model is sometimes called influential , as one of the first to market a true off-road capable family car . The initial Discovery was essentially created as a more affordable design fork of the standard wheelbase Range Rover of the time . Although positioned below the latter in the company 's line-up , the vehicle was both longer and higher , offered more room in the back , and optionally also more seats . Space utilization became more sophisticated in later iterations , but the series keeps offering seats for seven occupants . The second Discovery ( 1998 ) was called the Series II , and though featuring an extended rear body , was otherwise an updated face-lift , which carried on the 100 inch wheelbase ( 2.54 m ) frame and rigid , live front and rear axles of the original Range Rover into 2004 . The third iteration - succeeding the series I and II in 2004 - was either titled the Discovery 3 or simply LR3 ( in North America and The Middle East ) . This was the first all-original design for the Discovery . Although it followed the 2002 third generation Range Rover , also switching to fully independent suspension , it still received a separate , but integrated body and frame ( IBF ) structure .
