It has an area of 651,900 square kilometres ( 251,700 sq mi ) , nearly 10 percent of which ( 59,366 square kilometres ( 22,900 sq mi ) ) is fresh water , composed mostly of rivers , reservoirs , and the province 's 100,000 lakes . Saskatchewan is bordered on the west by Alberta , on the north by the Northwest Territories , on the east by Manitoba , to the northeast by Nunavut , and on the south by the U.S. states of Montana and North Dakota . As of Q3 2019 , Saskatchewan 's population was estimated at 1,178,657 . Residents primarily live in the southern prairie half of the province , while the northern boreal half is mostly forested and sparsely populated . Of the total population , roughly half live in the province 's largest city Saskatoon , or the provincial capital Regina . Other notable cities include Prince Albert , Moose Jaw , Yorkton , Swift Current , North Battleford , Melfort , and the border city Lloydminster ( partially within Alberta ) . Saskatchewan is a landlocked province with large distances to moderating bodies of waters . As a result , its climate is extremely continental , rendering severe winters throughout the province . Southern areas have very warm or hot summers . Midale and Yellow Grass ( both near the U.S. border ) are tied for the highest ever recorded temperatures in Canada , with 45 \u00b0C ( 113 \u00b0F ) observed at both locations on July 5 , 1937 .

The Red One ) is a palace and fortress complex located in Granada , Andalusia , Spain . It was originally constructed as a small fortress in AD 889 on the remains of Roman fortifications , and then largely ignored until its ruins were renovated and rebuilt in the mid-13th century by the Nasrid emir Mohammed ben Al-Ahmar of the Emirate of Granada , who built its current palace and walls . It was converted into a royal palace in 1333 by Yusuf I , Sultan of Granada . After the conclusion of the Christian Reconquista in 1492 , the site became the Royal Court of Ferdinand and Isabella ( where Christopher Columbus received royal endorsement for his expedition ) , and the palaces were partially altered in the Renaissance style . In 1526 Charles I & V commissioned a new Renaissance palace better befitting the Holy Roman Emperor in the revolutionary Mannerist style influenced by humanist philosophy in direct juxtaposition with the Nasrid Andalusian architecture , but it was ultimately never completed due to Morisco rebellions in Granada . Alhambra 's last flowering of Islamic palaces was built for the last Muslim emirs in Spain during the decline of the Nasrid dynasty , who were increasingly subject to the Christian Kings of Castile . After being allowed to fall into disrepair for centuries , the buildings occupied by squatters , Alhambra was rediscovered following the defeat of Napoleon , who had conducted retaliatory destruction of the site . The rediscoverers were first British intellectuals and then other north European Romantic travelers . It is now one of Spain 's major tourist attractions , exhibiting the country 's most significant and well-known Islamic architecture , together with 16th-century and later Christian building and garden interventions . The Alhambra is a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Moorish poets described it as a pearl set in emeralds , an allusion to the colour of its buildings and the woods around them .",

The battle took place amidst the Peninsular War , which was a part of the wider Napoleonic Wars . It was a result of a French campaign , led by Napoleon , which had defeated the Spanish armies and caused the British army to withdraw to the coast following an unsuccessful attempt by Moore to attack Soult 's corps and divert the French army . Doggedly pursued by the French under Soult , the British made a retreat across northern Spain while their rearguard fought off repeated French attacks . Both armies suffered extremely from the harsh winter conditions . Much of the British army , excluding the elite Light Brigade under Robert Craufurd , suffered from a loss of order and discipline during the retreat . When the British eventually reached the port of Corunna on the northern coast of Galicia in Spain , a few days ahead of the French , they found their transport ships had not arrived . The fleet arrived after a couple of days and the British were in the midst of embarking when the French forces launched an attack . They forced the British to fight another battle before being able to depart for England . In the resulting action , the British held off French attacks until nightfall , when both armies disengaged .

  "/wiki/Gold_rush": "A gold rush or gold fever is a new discovery of gold - sometimes accompanied by other precious metals and rare-earth minerals - that brings an onrush of miners seeking their fortune . Major gold rushes took place in the 19th century in Australia , New Zealand , Brazil , Canada , South Africa and the United States , while smaller gold rushes took place elsewhere . In the 19th century the wealth that resulted was distributed widely because of reduced migration costs and low barriers to entry . While gold mining itself proved unprofitable for most diggers and mine-owners , some people made large fortunes , and merchants and transportation facilities made large profits . The resulting increase in the world 's gold supply stimulated global trade and investment . Historians have written extensively about the mass migration , trade , colonization and environmental history associated with gold rushes . Gold rushes were typically marked by a general buoyant feeling of a free-for-all in income mobility , in which any single individual might become abundantly wealthy almost instantly , as expressed in the California Dream . Gold rushes helped spur waves of immigration that often led to permanent settlement of new regions . Activities propelled by gold rushes define significant aspects of the culture of the Australian and North American frontiers . At a time when the world 's money supply was based on gold , the newly-mined gold provided economic stimulus far beyond the gold fields , feeding into local and wider economic booms . Gold rushes occurred as early as the times of the Roman Empire , whose gold mining was described by Diodorus Siculus and Pliny the Elder , and probably further back to ancient Egypt .",

  "/wiki/White_people": "White people is a racial classification specifier , used mostly and often exclusively for people of European descent ; depending on context , nationality , and point of view . The term has at times been expanded to encompass persons of Middle Eastern and North African descent ( for example , in the US Census definition ) , persons who are often considered non-white in other contexts . The usage of white people or a white race for a large group of mainly or exclusively European populations , defined by their light skin , among other physical characteristics , and contrasting with black people , Amerindians , and other colored people or persons of color , originated in the 17th century . It was only during the 19th century that this vague category was transformed in a quasi-scientific system of race and skin color relations . The concept of a unified white race did not achieve universal acceptance in Europe when it first came into use in the 17th century , or in the centuries afterward . Nazi Germany regarded some European peoples such as Slavs as racially distinct from themselves . Prior to the modern age , no European peoples regarded themselves as white , but rather defined their race , ancestry , or ethnicity in terms of their nationality . Moreover , there is no accepted standard for determining the geographic barrier between white and non-white people . Contemporary anthropologists and other scientists , while recognizing the reality of biological variation between different human populations , regard the concept of a unified , distinguishable white race as socially constructed . As a group with several different potential boundaries , it is an example of a fuzzy concept . The concept of whiteness has particular resonance in racially diverse countries with large majority or minority populations of more or less mixed European ancestry : e.g. , in the United States ( White Americans ) , Canada ( white Canadians ) , Australia ( white Australians ) , New Zealand ( white New Zealanders ) , the United Kingdom ( white British ) , and South Africa ( white South Africans ) . In much of the rest of Europe , the distinction between race and nationality is more blurred ; when people are asked to describe their race or ancestry , they often describe it in terms of their nationality .",

Arabic is also widely spoken , arguably the largest minority language in France as of the 21st century ( a spot previously held by Breton and Occitan ) . Modern French society is a melting pot . From the middle of the 19th century , it experienced a high rate of inward migration , mainly consisting of Arab-Berbers , Jews , Sub-Saharan Africans , Chinese , and other peoples from Africa , the Middle East and East Asia , and the government , defining France as an inclusive nation with universal values , advocated assimilation through which immigrants were expected to adhere to French values and cultural norms . Nowadays , while the government has let newcomers retain their distinctive cultures since the mid-1980s and requires from them a mere integration , French citizens still equate their nationality with citizenship as does French law .

The river 's name and the name of the nearby towns of Espanola and Spanish are said to be due to French explorers and Jesuit priests encountering Ojibwe peoples speaking Spanish in the area , apparently as a result of a Spanish woman having been taken captive during an expedition far to the south .

Flores Island was named in 1791 by Francisco de Eliza , in honor of Manuel Antonio Fl\u00f3rez , the 51st viceroy of New Spain . The main industry is fishing with some tourism . Tourism is promoted through the 'Walk the Wild Side ' hiking trail and the addition of accommodation at the Aauuknuck Lodge . Cow Bay on the Western side of the Island has been voted as one of Canada 's top ten beaches . The island can be reached by water-taxi or seaplane from Tofino .",

Greek colonies and communities have been historically established on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea , but the Greek people have always been centered on the Aegean and Ionian seas , where the Greek language has been spoken since the Bronze Age . Until the early 20th century , Greeks were distributed between the Greek peninsula , the western coast of Asia Minor , the Black Sea coast , Cappadocia in central Anatolia , Egypt , the Balkans , Cyprus , and Constantinople . Many of these regions coincided to a large extent with the borders of the Byzantine Empire of the late 11th century and the Eastern Mediterranean areas of ancient Greek colonization . The cultural centers of the Greeks have included Athens , Thessalonica , Alexandria , Smyrna , and Constantinople at various periods . In recent times , most ethnic Greeks live within the borders of the modern Greek state and Cyprus . The Greek genocide and population exchange between Greece and Turkey nearly ended the three millennia-old Greek presence in Asia Minor . Other longstanding Greek populations can be found from southern Italy to the Caucasus and southern Russia and Ukraine and in the Greek diaspora communities in a number of other countries .

  "/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada": "The provinces and territories of Canada are sub-national divisions within the geographical areas of Canada under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Constitution . In the 1867 Canadian Confederation , three provinces of British North America - New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , and the Province of Canada ( which upon Confederation was divided into Ontario and Quebec ) - were united to form a federated colony , becoming a sovereign nation in the next century . Over its history , Canada 's international borders have changed several times , and the country has grown from the original four provinces to the current ten provinces and three territories . Together , the provinces and territories make up the world 's second-largest country by area . The major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces receive their power and authority from the Constitution Act , 1867 ( formerly called the British North America Act , 1867 ) , whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the Parliament of Canada . The powers flowing from the Constitution Act are divided between the Government of Canada ( the federal government ) and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively . A change to the division of powers between the federal government and the provinces requires a constitutional amendment , whereas a similar change affecting the territories can be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada or government . In modern Canadian constitutional theory , the provinces are considered sovereign within certain areas based on the divisions of responsibility between the provincial and federal government within the Constitution Act 1867 , and each province thus has its own representative of the Canadian Crown , the lieutenant governor . The territories are not sovereign , but instead their authorities and responsibilities come directly from the federal level , and as a result , have a commissioner instead of a lieutenant governor .",

Upper Canada included all of modern-day Southern Ontario and all those areas of Northern Ontario in the Pays d'en Haut which had formed part of New France , essentially the watersheds of the Ottawa River or Lakes Huron and Superior , excluding any lands within the watershed of Hudson Bay . The upper prefix in the name reflects its geographic position along the Great Lakes , mostly above the headwaters of the Saint Lawrence River , contrasted with Lower Canada ( present-day Quebec ) to the northeast . It was the primary destination of Loyalist refugees and settlers from the United States after the American Revolution , who often were granted land to settle in Upper Canada . The province was characterized by its British way of life , including bicameral parliament and separate civil and criminal law , rather than mixed as in Lower Canada or elsewhere in the British Empire . The division was created to ensure the exercise of the same rights and privileges enjoyed by loyal subjects elsewhere in the North American colonies . In 1812 , war broke out between Great Britain and the United States , leading to several battles in Upper Canada . The US had hoped to capture Upper Canada , but the war ended with the situation unchanged . The government of the colony came to be dominated by a small group of persons , known as the Family Compact , who held most of the top positions in the Legislative Council and appointed officials . In 1837 , an unsuccessful rebellion attempted to overthrow the undemocratic system . Representative government would be established in the 1840s .

McClellan was initially successful against the equally cautious General Joseph E. Johnston , but the emergence of the more aggressive General Robert E.

Just before the siege preparations were completed , the Confederates , now under the direct command of Johnston , began a withdrawal toward Richmond . The first heavy fighting of the campaign occurred in the Battle of Williamsburg , in which the Union troops managed some tactical victories , but the Confederates continued their withdrawal . An amphibious flanking movement to Eltham 's Landing was ineffective in cutting off the Confederate retreat . In the Battle of Drewry 's Bluff , an attempt by the U.S. Navy to reach Richmond by way of the James River was repulsed .

The group comprises the large superfamily Papilionoidea , which contains at least one former group , the skippers ( formerly the superfamily Hesperioidea ) , and the most recent analyses suggest it also contains the moth-butterflies ( formerly the superfamily Hedyloidea ) . Butterfly fossils date to the Paleocene , which was about 56 million years ago . Butterflies have the typical four-stage insect life cycle . Winged adults lay eggs on the food plant on which their larvae , known as caterpillars , will feed . The caterpillars grow , sometimes very rapidly , and when fully developed , pupate in a chrysalis . When metamorphosis is complete , the pupal skin splits , the adult insect climbs out , and after its wings have expanded and dried , it flies off . Some butterflies , especially in the tropics , have several generations in a year , while others have a single generation , and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their entire life cycle . Butterflies are often polymorphic , and many species make use of camouflage , mimicry and aposematism to evade their predators . Some , like the monarch and the painted lady , migrate over long distances . Many butterflies are attacked by parasites or parasitoids , including wasps , protozoans , flies , and other invertebrates , or are preyed upon by other organisms .",
