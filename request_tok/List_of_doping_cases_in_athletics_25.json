Ghana means Warrior King in the Soninke language . The first permanent state in the territory of present-day Ghana dates back to the 11th century . Numerous kingdoms and empires emerged over the centuries , of which the most powerful was the Kingdom of Ashanti . Beginning in the 15th century , numerous European powers contested the area for trading rights , with the British ultimately established control of the coast by the late 19th century . Following over a century of native resistance , Ghana 's current borders were established by the 1900s as the British Gold Coast . It became independent of the United Kingdom on 6 March 1957 . Ghana 's population of approximately 30 million spans a variety of ethnic , linguistic and religious groups . According to the 2010 census , 71.2% of the population was Christian , 17.6% was Muslim , and 5.2% practised traditional faiths .

It was developed by American pharmaceutical company Winthrop Laboratories ( Sterling Drug ) in 1962 , and has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for human use , though it is no longer marketed in the USA . It is also used in veterinary medicine . Stanozolol has mostly been discontinued , and remains available in only a few countries . It is given by mouth in humans or by injection into muscle in animals . Unlike most injectable AAS , stanozolol is not esterified and is sold as an aqueous suspension , or in oral tablet form . The drug has a high oral bioavailability , due to a C17\u03b1 alkylation which allows the hormone to survive first-pass liver metabolism when ingested . It is because of this that stanozolol is also sold in tablet form . Stanozolol is one of the AAS commonly used as performance-enhancing drugs and is banned from use in sports competition under the auspices of the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) and many other sporting bodies . Additionally , stanozolol has been used in US horse racing .",

  "/wiki/Biological_passport": "An athlete biological passport is an individual electronic record for professional athletes , in which profiles of biological markers of doping and results of doping tests are collated over a period of time . Doping violations can be detected by noting variances from an athletes established levels outside permissible limits , rather than testing for and identifying illegal substances . Although the terminology athlete passport is recent , the use of biological markers of doping has a long history in anti-doping . Maybe the first marker of doping , that tries to detect a prohibited substance not based on its presence in urine or blood , but through the induced deviations in biological parameters , is the so-called testosterone over epitestosterone ratio ( T/E ) . The T/E has been used by sports authorities since the beginning of the 1980s to detect anabolic steroids in urine samples . A decade later , in 1997 , markers of blood doping were introduced by some international federations , such as the Union Cycliste Internationale ( UCI ) and the Federation Internationale de Ski , to deter the abuse of recombinant erythropoietin that was undetectable by direct means at that time . It is only in 2002 that the concept of using biological markers to detect doping became known by the term athlete passport . The merits of this testing paradigm were exposed in the scientific literature and the terminology adopted by the World Anti-Doping agency . Many believe [ who ? ] that the athlete passport provides an excellent alternative to ensure fairness in elite sports . While a new drug test must be developed and validated for each new drug , the main advantage of the athlete passport is that it is based on the stability of the physiology of the human being . New drugs are produced at an unprecedented pace today and there is often a lag of several years between the availability of a new drug and the application of an effective detection method .",

It has land borders with Lebanon to the north , Syria to the northeast , Jordan on the east , the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west , respectively , and Egypt to the southwest . The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area . Israel 's economic and technological center is Tel Aviv , while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem , although the state 's sovereignty over Jerusalem has only partial recognition . [ fn 4 ] Israel has evidence of the earliest migration of hominids out of Africa . Canaanite tribes are archaeologically attested since the Middle Bronze Age , while the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah emerged during the Iron Age . The Neo-Assyrian Empire destroyed Israel around 720 BCE . Judah was later conquered by the Babylonian , Persian and Hellenistic empires and had existed as Jewish autonomous provinces . The successful Maccabean Revolt led to an independent Hasmonean kingdom by 110 BCE , which in 63 BCE however became a client state of the Roman Republic that subsequently installed the Herodian dynasty in 37 BCE , and in 6 CE created the Roman province of Judea . Judea lasted as a Roman province until the failed Jewish revolts resulted in widespread destruction , the expulsion of the Jewish population and the renaming of the region from Iudaea to Syria Palaestina . Jewish presence in the region has persisted to a certain extent over the centuries . In the 7th century CE , the Levant was taken from the Byzantine Empire by the Arabs and remained in Muslim control until the First Crusade of 1099 , followed by the Ayyubid conquest of 1187 .",

[ XIII ] The metropolitan area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea , and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean . It is bordered by Belgium , Luxembourg and Germany to the northeast , Switzerland and Italy to the east , and Andorra and Spain to the south . The overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the Atlantic , Pacific and Indian oceans . The country 's 18 integral regions ( five of which are situated overseas ) span a combined area of 643,801 square kilometres ( 248,573 sq mi ) and a total population of 67.02 million ( as of July 2019 [ update ] ) . France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris , the country 's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre . Other major urban areas include Lyon , Marseille , Toulouse , Bordeaux , Lille and Nice . France , including its overseas territories , has the most number of time zones of any country , with a total of 12 . During the Iron Age , what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls , a Celtic people . Rome annexed the area in 51 BC , holding it until the arrival of Germanic Franks in 476 , who formed the Kingdom of Francia . The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned Francia into East Francia , Middle Francia and West Francia .

Low levels of EPO ( around 10 mU/mL ) are constantly secreted sufficient to compensate for normal red blood cell turnover . Common causes of cellular hypoxia resulting in elevated levels of EPO ( up to 10 000 mU/mL ) include any anemia , and hypoxemia due to chronic lung disease . Erythropoietin is produced by interstitial fibroblasts in the kidney in close association with the peritubular capillary and proximal convoluted tubule . It is also produced in perisinusoidal cells in the liver . Liver production predominates in the fetal and perinatal period ; renal production predominates in adulthood . It is homologous with thrombopoietin . Exogenous erythropoietin , recombinant human erythropoietin ( rhEPO ) , is produced by recombinant DNA technology in cell culture and are collectively called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESA ) : two examples are epoetin alfa and epoetin beta . ESAs are used in the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease , anemia in myelodysplasia , and in anemia from cancer chemotherapy . Risks of therapy include death , myocardial infarction , stroke , venous thromboembolism , and tumor recurrence . Risk increases when EPO treatment raises hemoglobin levels over 11 g/dL to 12 g/dL : this is to be avoided . rhEPO has been used illicitly as a performance-enhancing drug .",

Its capital and most populous city is Minsk . Over 40% of its 207,600 square kilometres ( 80,200 sq mi ) is forested . Its major economic sectors are service industries and manufacturing . Until the 20th century , different states at various times controlled the lands of modern-day Belarus , including the Principality of Polotsk ( 11th to 14th centuries ) , the Grand Duchy of Lithuania , the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , and the Russian Empire . In the aftermath of the 1917 Russian Revolution , Belarus declared independence as the Belarusian People 's Republic , which was conquered by Soviet Russia . The Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia became a founding constituent republic of the Soviet Union in 1922 and was renamed as the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic ( Byelorussian SSR ) . Belarus lost almost half of its territory to Poland after the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1921 . Much of the borders of Belarus took their modern shape in 1939 , when some lands of the Second Polish Republic were reintegrated into it after the Soviet invasion of Poland , and were finalized after World War II . During WWII , military operations devastated Belarus , which lost about a quarter of its population and half of its economic resources . The republic was redeveloped in the post-war years . In 1945 the Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the United Nations , along with the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR .",
  "/wiki/Steroid": "A steroid is a biologically active organic compound with four rings arranged in a specific molecular configuration . Steroids have two principal biological functions : as important components of cell membranes which alter membrane fluidity ; and as signaling molecules . Hundreds of steroids are found in plants , animals and fungi . All steroids are manufactured in cells from the sterols lanosterol ( opisthokonts ) or cycloartenol ( plants ) . Lanosterol and cycloartenol are derived from the cyclization of the triterpene squalene . The steroid core structure is typically composed of seventeen carbon atoms , bonded in four fused rings : three six-member cyclohexane rings ( rings A , B and C in the first illustration ) and one five-member cyclopentane ring ( the D ring ) . Steroids vary by the functional groups attached to this four-ring core and by the oxidation state of the rings . Sterols are forms of steroids with a hydroxy group at position three and a skeleton derived from cholestane . :1785f Steroids can also be more radically modified , such as by changes to the ring structure , for example , cutting one of the rings . Cutting Ring B produces secosteroids one of which is vitamin D3 . Examples include the lipid cholesterol , the sex hormones estradiol and testosterone , :10-19 and the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone ."
