  "section_text": "In 1992 , to celebrate the 125th anniversary of Confederation , the Mint released twelve commemorative coins , one for each Canadian province and territory at the time . These were the inspiration [ 11 ] for the US 50 State Quarters program of 1999\u20132008 . Nunavut , which separated from the Northwest Territories seven years later in 1999 , was honoured with a special $ 2 coin .",
  "uid": "Quarter_(Canadian_coin)_1",
  "intro": "The quarter, short for quarter dollar, is a Canadian coin worth 25 cents or one-fourth of a Canadian dollar. It is a small, circular coin of silver colour. According to the Royal Canadian Mint, the official name for the coin is the 25-cent piece, but in practice it is usually called a quarter, much like its American counterpart. In French, it is called a caribou or trente sous (thirty sous, based on the old exchange rate). The coin is produced at the Royal Canadian Mint's facility in Winnipeg, Manitoba."
