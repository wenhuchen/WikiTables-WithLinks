It runs along the newly constructed light-rail tracks on Third Street and Bayshore Boulevard in the Visitacion Valley , Bayview/Hunters Point , Dogpatch , and Mission Bay neighborhoods , connecting to the existing Muni Metro system along the southern Embarcadero and below Market Street , and replaced the 15 Third bus line .
