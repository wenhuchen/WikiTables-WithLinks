  "/wiki/Polish_Americans": "Polish Americans are Americans who have total or partial Polish ancestry . There are an estimated 10.5 million self-identified Polish Americans , representing about 3% of the U.S. population . Polish Americans are the largest Slavic and West Slavic ethnic group in the United States , second largest Central European group after the Germans , and the eighth largest immigrant group overall . The first Polish settlers arrived at Walter Raleigh 's failed Roanoke Colony in 1585 . In 1608 Polish settlers came to the Virginia Colony as skilled craftsmen . Two early Polish visitors , Casimir Pulaski and Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko , led armies in the Revolutionary War and are remembered as national heroes . Overall , around 2.2 million Poles and Polish subjects immigrated into the United States , between 1820 and 1914 , chiefly after national insurgencies and famine . They included former Polish citizens of Roman Catholic , Protestant , Jewish or other minority descent . Exact immigration figures are unknown . Many immigrants were classified as Russian , German or Austrian by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service as the Polish state did not exist from 1795 to 1918 when the former territories of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth were under Prussian , Austrian-Hungarian and Russian control . Complicating the U.S. Census figures further is the high proportion of Polish Americans who married people of other national descent . In 1940 , about 50 percent married other American ethnics and a study in 1988 found that 54% of Polish Americans were of mixed ancestry from three generations or longer .",

  "/wiki/National_Park_Service_rustic": "National Park Service rustic - sometimes colloquially called Parkitecture - is a style of architecture that developed in the early and middle 20th century in the United States National Park Service ( NPS ) through its efforts to create buildings that harmonized with the natural environment . Since its founding in 1916 , the NPS sought to design and build visitor facilities without visually interrupting the natural or historic surroundings . The early results were characterized by intensive use of hand labor and a rejection of the regularity and symmetry of the industrial world , reflecting connections with the Arts and Crafts movement and American Picturesque architecture . Architects , landscape architects and engineers combined native wood and stone with convincingly native styles to create visually appealing structures that seemed to fit naturally within the majestic landscapes . Examples of the style can be found in numerous types of National Park structures , including entrance gateways , hotels and lodges , park roads and bridges , visitor centers , trail shelters , informational kiosks , and even mundane maintenance and support facilities . Many of these buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places .",
  "/wiki/New_Deal": "The New Deal was a series of programs , public work projects , financial reforms , and regulations enacted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the United States between 1933 and 1939 . It responded to needs for relief , reform , and recovery from the Great Depression . Major federal programs and agencies included the Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) , the Civil Works Administration ( CWA ) , the Farm Security Administration ( FSA ) , the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 ( NIRA ) and the Social Security Administration ( SSA ) . They provided support for farmers , the unemployed , youth and the elderly . The New Deal included new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and efforts to re-inflate the economy after prices had fallen sharply . New Deal programs included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt . The programs focused on what historians refer to as the 3 Rs : relief for the unemployed and poor , recovery of the economy back to normal levels , and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression . The New Deal produced a political realignment , making the Democratic Party the majority ( as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 to 1969 ) with its base in liberal ideas , the South , traditional [ clarification needed ] Democrats , big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions and non-whites and ethnic whites . The Republicans were split , with conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as hostile to business and economic growth and liberals in support . The realignment crystallized into the New Deal coalition that dominated presidential elections into the 1960s while the opposing conservative coalition largely controlled Congress in domestic affairs from 1937 to 1964 .",

  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",

Today the importance of the fur trade has diminished ; it is based on pelts produced at fur farms and regulated fur-bearer trapping , but has become controversial .

Its southern terminus in New Orleans is at an intersection with U.S. Route 90 ( US 90 ) . The highway is often called the Blues Highway because it connects Saint Paul , Minnesota ; St. Louis , Missouri ; Memphis , Tennessee ; the Mississippi Delta , and New Orleans . The route was an important south-north connection in the days before the interstate highway system . Many southerners traveled north along US 61 while going to St. Louis and Saint Paul . The highway has a long musical history , being the supposed location where singer-songwriter Robert Johnson made a deal with the Devil for his successes . The road later gave its name to Minnesota native Bob Dylan 's album Highway 61 Revisited and to the song of the same name , which imagines all sorts of fantastical events ( including World War III ) occurring alongside it . Other notable songs named for the highway include a blues song recorded in 1957 by Sunnyland Slim ; one in 1962 by Johnny Young ; and a 1981 song , 61 Highway , by bluesman James Son Thomas .

  "/wiki/Recreational_Demonstration_Area": "The Recreational Demonstration Area program ( also known as the Recreation Demonstration Area program ) was a National Park Service program during the 1930s and early 1940s that built forty-six public parks in twenty-four states on 397,000 acres ( 1,606.6 km2 ) , chiefly near urban areas in the United States . The NPS used labor from a variety of Great Depression federal relief programs , chiefly the Civilian Conservation Corps and Works Progress Administration , to build recreational demonstration areas . By the end of World War II , the recreational demonstration areas had all either become National Park Service units or been given to their states for use as state parks . The goals of the Recreation Demonstration Area program were typically threefold : 1 ) to develop land as a park ; 2 ) to provide employment ; and 3 ) to create new parks near urban areas . For the first goal , in some cases the land developed was purchased from sub-optimal farmers , providing some of the poorest farmers with relief . In other cases , state lands ( in state forests or parks ) were developed . In the second case , the CCC and WPA laborers received payment , and in the CCC , room and board .
