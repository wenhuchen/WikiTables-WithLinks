With an estimated population of over 42 million , it is among the ten most populous states in Africa . Algeria is bordered to the northeast by Tunisia , to the east by Libya , to the west by Morocco , to the southwest by the Western Saharan territory , Mauritania , and Mali , to the southeast by Niger , and to the north by the Mediterranean Sea .

  "/wiki/OPEC": "The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC , /\u02c8o\u028ap\u025bk/ OH-pek ) is an intergovernmental organization of 14 [ ref ] nations , founded on 14 September 1960 in Baghdad by the first five members ( Iran , Iraq , Kuwait , Saudi Arabia , and Venezuela ) , and headquartered since 1965 in Vienna , Austria . As of September 2018 , [ update ] the then 14 member countries accounted for an estimated 44 percent of global oil production and 81.5 percent of the world 's proven oil reserves , giving OPEC a major influence on global oil prices that were previously determined by the so-called Seven Sisters grouping of multinational oil companies . The stated mission of the organization is to coordinate and unify the petroleum policies of its member countries and ensure the stabilization of oil markets , in order to secure an efficient , economic and regular supply of petroleum to consumers , a steady income to producers , and a fair return on capital for those investing in the petroleum industry . The organization is also a significant provider of information about the international oil market . The current OPEC members are the following : [ ref ] Algeria , Angola , Equatorial Guinea , Gabon , Iran , Iraq , Kuwait , Libya , Nigeria , the Republic of the Congo , Saudi Arabia ( the de facto leader ) , the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela . Ecuador , Indonesia and Qatar are former members . The formation of OPEC marked a turning point toward national sovereignty over natural resources , and OPEC decisions have come to play a prominent role in the global oil market and international relations . The effect can be particularly strong when wars or civil disorders lead to extended interruptions in supply . In the 1970s , restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in oil prices and in the revenue and wealth of OPEC , with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the global economy . In the 1980s , OPEC began setting production targets for its member nations ; generally , when the targets are reduced , oil prices increase . This has occurred most recently from the organization 's 2008 and 2016 decisions to trim oversupply . Economists often cite OPEC as a textbook example of a cartel that cooperates to reduce market competition , but one whose consultations are protected by the doctrine of state immunity under international law .",

One can transfer or lose ownership of property by selling it for money , exchanging it for other property , giving it as a gift , misplacing it , or having it stripped from one 's ownership through legal means such as eviction , foreclosure , seizure , or taking . Ownership is self-propagating in that the owner of any property will also own the economic benefits of that property .",

  "/wiki/Entrepreneur": "Entrepreneurship is the process of designing , launching and running a new business , which is often initially a small business . The people who create these businesses are called entrepreneurs . Entrepreneurship has been described as the capacity and willingness to develop , organize and manage a business venture along with any of its risks to make a profit . While definitions of entrepreneurship typically focus on the launching and running of businesses , due to the high risks involved in launching a start-up , a significant proportion of start-up businesses have to close due to lack of funding , bad business decisions , an economic crisis , lack of market demand , or a combination of all of these . A broader definition of the term is sometimes used , especially in the field of economics . In this usage , an Entrepreneur is an entity which has the ability to find and act upon opportunities to translate inventions or technologies into products and services : The entrepreneur is able to recognize the commercial potential of the invention and organize the capital , talent , and other resources that turn an invention into a commercially viable innovation . In this sense , the term Entrepreneurship also captures innovative activities on the part of established firms , in addition to similar activities on the part of new businesses . Coming up with an idea for a product or service is not the hardest thing for startups and entrepreneurs . Building a product isnt even the hardest . Truly , the hardest part is making it work , or in other words , getting people to like and want to buy your product , and beating the competition at the same time",

  "/wiki/Hydraulic_fracturing": "Hydraulic fracturing ( also called fracking , fracing , hydrofracking , fraccing , frac'ing , and hydrofracturing ) is a well stimulation technique in which rock is fractured by a pressurized liquid . The process involves the high-pressure injection of 'fracking fluid ' ( primarily water , containing sand or other proppants suspended with the aid of thickening agents ) into a wellbore to create cracks in the deep-rock formations through which natural gas , petroleum , and brine will flow more freely . When the hydraulic pressure is removed from the well , small grains of hydraulic fracturing proppants ( either sand or aluminium oxide ) hold the fractures open . Hydraulic fracturing began as an experiment in 1947 , and the first commercially successful application followed in 1950 . As of 2012 , 2.5 million frac jobs had been performed worldwide on oil and gas wells ; over one million of those within the U.S . Such treatment is generally necessary to achieve adequate flow rates in shale gas , tight gas , tight oil , and coal seam gas wells . Some hydraulic fractures can form naturally in certain veins or dikes . Drilling and hydraulic fracturing have made the United States a major crude oil exporter as of 2019 , while helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions . Improvements in the national economy and better prices for consumers have been a result of the decade-long fracking boom . Hydraulic fracturing is highly controversial . Its proponents advocate the economic benefits of more extensively accessible hydrocarbons , as well as replacing coal with natural gas , which burns cleaner and emits half as much carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) . Opponents of fracking argue that these are outweighed by the potential environmental impacts , which include risks of ground water and surface water contamination , noise and air pollution , and the triggering of earthquakes , along with the resulting hazards to public health and the environment .",
