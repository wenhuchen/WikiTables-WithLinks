  "/wiki/Araya_Peninsula": "The Araya Peninsula is a peninsula on the Caribbean Sea , located in Sucre State , northern Venezuela . The peninsula is part of the eastern Serran\u00eda del Litoral mountain range , in the Venezuelan Coastal Ranges System of the northern Andes . It extends eastward from the coastline . The town of Araya is located on its westernmost extremity . The western tip of the Araya Peninsula is known for its large , purple-colored natural salt pans , which became a major site of salt mining during the colonial era . In the late 16th and early 17th centuries , the region was regularly mined for salt by Dutch smugglers , who reportedly numbered one hundred ships annually . The smuggling industry in the region was temporarily stymied by a Spanish punitive expedition sent in 1605 , although it soon recovered . Eventually , in 1618 , Spanish forces began constructing the fortress El Castillo de Santiago de Araya to guard the peninsula . When it was completed in 1665 , the fortress permanently put an end to Dutch incursions . The salt mines of the Araya Peninsula were the setting of the award-winning 1959 documentary film Araya by filmmaker Margot Benacerraf .",
