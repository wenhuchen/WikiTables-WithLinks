  "/wiki/Venture_capital": "Venture capital ( VC ) is a type of financing that is provided by firms or funds to small , early-stage , emerging firms that are deemed to have high growth potential , or which have demonstrated high growth ( in terms of number of employees , annual revenue , or both ) . Venture capital firms or funds invest in these early-stage companies in exchange for equity , or an ownership stake , in those companies . Venture capitalists take on the risk of financing risky start-ups in the hopes that some of the firms they support will become successful . Because startups face high uncertainty , VC investments have high rates of failure . The start-ups are usually based on an innovative technology or business model and they are usually from the high technology industries , such as information technology ( IT ) , clean technology or biotechnology . The typical venture capital investment occurs after an initial seed funding round . The first round of institutional venture capital to fund growth is called the Series A round . Venture capitalists provide this financing in the interest of generating a return through an eventual exit event , such as the company selling shares to the public for the first time in an initial public offering ( IPO ) or doing a merger and acquisition ( also known as a trade sale ) of the company . Alternatively , an exit may come about via the private equity secondary market . In addition to angel investing , equity crowdfunding and other seed funding options , venture capital is attractive for new companies with limited operating history that are too small to raise capital in the public markets and have not reached the point where they are able to secure a bank loan or complete a debt offering . In exchange for the high risk that venture capitalists assume by investing in smaller and early-stage companies , venture capitalists usually get significant control over company decisions , in addition to a significant portion of the companies ' ownership ( and consequently value ) . Start-ups like Uber , Airbnb , Flipkart , Xiaomi & Didi Chuxing are highly valued startups , commonly known as unicorns , where venture capitalists contribute more than financing to these early-stage firms ; they also often provide strategic advice to the firm 's executives on its business model and marketing strategies .",

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia .

With an estimated population of 391,006 in 2018 , it is the most populous city in Louisiana . Serving as a major port , New Orleans is considered an economic and commercial hub for the broader Gulf Coast region of the United States . New Orleans is world-renowned for its distinct music , Creole cuisine , unique dialect , and its annual celebrations and festivals , most notably Mardi Gras . The historic heart of the city is the French Quarter , known for its French and Spanish Creole architecture and vibrant nightlife along Bourbon Street . The city has been described as the most unique in the United States , owing in large part to its cross-cultural and multilingual heritage . Founded in 1718 by French colonists , New Orleans was once the territorial capital of French Louisiana before being traded to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 . New Orleans in 1840 was the third-most populous city in the United States , and it was the largest city in the American South from the Antebellum era until after World War II . The city has historically been very vulnerable to flooding , due to such factors as high rainfall , low lying elevation , poor natural drainage and location next to multiple bodies of water . State and federal authorities have installed a complex system of levees and drainage pumps in an effort to protect the city . New Orleans was severely affected by Hurricane Katrina on August 29 , 2005 , which resulted in flooding more than 80% of the city , thousands of deaths , and so much displacement because of damaged communities and lost housing as to cause a population decline of over 50% .

  "/wiki/Drive-in": "A drive-in is a facility ( such as a restaurant or movie theater ) where one can drive in with an automobile for service . At a drive-in restaurant , for example , customers park their vehicles and are usually served by staff who walk or rollerskate out to take orders and return with food , encouraging diners to remain parked while they eat . Drive-in theaters have a large screen and a car parking area for film-goers . It is usually distinguished from a drive-through , in which drivers line up to make an order at a microphone set up at window height , and then drive to a window where they pay and receive their food . The drivers then take their meals elsewhere to eat . Notably however , during peak periods , patrons may be required to park in a designated parking spot and wait for their food to be directly served to them by an attendant walking to their car , resulting in the perceived relationship between the two service-types . In the German-speaking world , the term is now often used instead of drive-through for that kind of service . In Japan , the term refers to a rest area . In France , this term has become popular because of American movies showing that kind of service , and more recently due to the expansion of fast-food restaurants . The first drive-in restaurant was Kirby 's Pig Stand , which opened in Dallas , Texas , in 1921 .

Hayes was a major brand in the modem market from the introduction of the original 300 bit/s Smartmodem in 1981 . They remained a major vendor throughout the 1980s , periodically introducing models with higher throughput . Their competition through this period was primarily from two other high-end vendors , US Robotics and Telebit , while other companies mostly sold into niches or were strictly low-end offerings . In the early 1990s a number of greatly cost-reduced high-performance modems were released by competitors , notably the SupraFAXModem 14400 , which eroded price points in the market .

  "/wiki/Modem": "A modem - a portmanteau of modulator-demodulator - is a hardware device that converts data into a format suitable for a transmission medium so that it can be transmitted from one computer to another ( historically along telephone wires ) . A modem modulates one or more carrier wave signals to encode digital information for transmission and demodulates signals to decode the transmitted information . The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded reliably to reproduce the original digital data . Modems can be used with almost any means of transmitting analog signals from light-emitting diodes to radio . A common type of modem is one that turns the digital data of a computer into modulated electrical signal for transmission over telephone lines and demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to recover the digital data . Modems are generally classified by the maximum amount of data they can send in a given unit of time , usually expressed in bits per second ( symbol bit/s , sometimes abbreviated bps ) or rarely in bytes per second ( symbol B/s ) . Modems can also be classified by their symbol rate , measured in baud . The baud unit denotes symbols per second , or the number of times per second the modem sends a new signal . For example , the ITU V.21 standard used audio frequency-shift keying with two possible frequencies , corresponding to two distinct symbols ( or one bit per symbol ) , to carry 300 bits per second using 300 baud . By contrast , the original ITU V.22 standard , which could transmit and receive four distinct symbols ( two bits per symbol ) , transmitted 1,200 bits by sending 600 symbols per second ( 600 baud ) using phase-shift keying ."
