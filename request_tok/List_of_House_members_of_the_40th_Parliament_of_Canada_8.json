The Bloc was formed by Members of Parliament ( MPs ) who defected from the federal Progressive Conservative Party and Liberal Party during the collapse of the Meech Lake Accord . Founder Lucien Bouchard was a cabinet minister in the federal Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney . The party seeks to create the conditions necessary for the political secession of Quebec from Canada and campaigns actively only within the province during federal elections . The party has been described as social democratic and separatist ( aka sovereigntist ) . The Bloc was the largest party in Quebec after Canadian federal elections , and either the second- or third-largest party in the House of Commons , for seven straight federal elections from the 1993 election until 2011 . The 2011 election saw the party win just four seats and lose official party status after a wave of support for the New Democratic Party . By 2014 , the party had been reduced to two seats because of resignations and expulsions . In the 2015 federal election , the Bloc won 10 seats in the House of Commons , even though the party 's leader Gilles Duceppe failed to win a seat . In the 2019 federal election , the party won 32 seats , regaining official party status as a result . The Bloc has strong informal ties to the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ( PQ , whose members are known as P\u00e9quistes ) , a provincial party that advocates for the secession of Quebec from Canada and its independence , but the two are not linked organizationally . As with its provincial counterpart , the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois has been supported by a wide range of voters in Quebec , from sections of organized labour to more conservative rural voters .",
