Only the limestone abutments remained when the site was surveyed in 1988.:46 The bridge is one of the oldest remaining man-made bridges in Tennessee . A photograph of the bridge is available which shows the structure consisted of massive masonry abutments with a short pole bridge suspended between them . Pole bridges were probably the most common type of bridge erected in frontier days and are still used today for simple county bridges . These bridges consist merely of poles ( trees or logs ) extending from one abutment to another with a deck of saplings or planks laid across these poles . Obviously these could be quite primitive with the ground or a natural feature such as a rock shelf serving as the abutments , but they could only be used for short spans . Some pole bridges used log cribs filled with rock and dirt as abutments . This is considered to be the only site on the Natchez Trace in Williamson County , Tennessee , that retains historic integrity . :46 It is located about 300 yards from Thomas Brown House , which is also NRHP-listed , and near a plaque to Old Town , an Indian village and mounds site .",
