Tall , lanky and long-haired , Kelso had been accepted as the local idiot until he moved to Chicago for the eighth season . His behavior is very much in line with a stereotypical oversexed lunkhead or a male-bimbo who gets through life on his good looks . He spends most of the series in a mutually parasitic relationship with the equally vapid Jackie Burkhart , whom he continues to obsess over following their numerous breakups . In spite of his stupidity , Kelso is shown on several occasions not to be immature , simply unmotivated ; when he is either forced to or chooses to , Kelso displays startling intelligence unbecoming of his usual personality or hi-jinks . Near the end of the series , Kelso becomes one of the first characters to completely break away from adolescence and into adulthood when he impregnates a girl with whom he had a one-night stand ; to his friends ' surprise , Kelso took responsibility for the child , moving to Chicago to take a job to support and be near his newborn daughter .",
