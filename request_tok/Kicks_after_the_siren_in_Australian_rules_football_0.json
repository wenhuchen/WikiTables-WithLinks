Despite being the first club to win a VFL Grand Final they were not the first team to win a premiership . That honour belongs to the Essendon Football Club who were crowned premiers in 1897 without a Grand Final being played . Although Fitzroy won a total of eight VFL premierships they never won a premiership as the Lions . They won seven premierships ( 1898 , 1899 , 1904 , 1905 , 1913 , 1916 and 1922 ) as the Maroons and one ( 1944 ) as the Gorillas . The decision of the club to change its name to the Lions in 1957 coincided with what history now records as the beginning of decades of poor on-field performance and financial mismanagement that eventually resulted in the club being placed into administration and forced out of the AFL in 1996 . Although the club managed to survive and came out of administration in 1998 it never played in the AFL again . Fitzroy largely resumed its original VFL-AFL identity through its continued use of their 1975-1996 VFL-AFL jumper , their theme song and their 1884-1966 home ground at the Brunswick Street Oval . For a brief time it experimented in partnerships with other semi professional and amateur clubs before incorporating the Fitzroy Reds ( formerly University Reds ) to play in the Victorian Amateur Football Association .

An informal Melbourne team played that winter and was officially formed in May 1859 when Wills and three other members codified The Rules of the Melbourne Football Club - the basis of Australian rules football .

  "/wiki/Doug_Strang": "Doug Strang was an Australian rules footballer who played as a full forward in the VFL between 1931 and 1935 for the Richmond Football Club . Strang was originally recruited from East Albury after one season in the Ovens and Murray Football League as part of a major country recruiting drive by the Tigers , who were eager to break a run of Grand Final losses to Collingwood dating back to 1927 . In just his second VFL game , his 14 goals kicked against North Melbourne in 1931 still stands to this day as the record for the most goals kicked by a Richmond player in a single game , and as the youngest player to kick ten or more goals in a VFL game , at just 18 years and 300 days old . In his first season Strangs brilliant overhead marking , in spite of exceptionally wet weather for much of the winter , brought him sixty-eight goals with long drop kicks . In 1932 , Strang struggled severely in another rainy winter , but from the time he kicked a goal after the bell to end an eleven match winning streak by Carlton , his brilliant marking asserted itself , most notably in a wonderful display on a dry ground in the second-semi-final . 1933 saw Strang begin to suffer from injuries later in the season . After he had seemingly returned to his best form with ten goals at Arden Street in the thirteenth round , Strang damaged a thigh when playing for the Tigers against the Ballarat League between the fifteenth and sixteenth rounds , and due to knee problems was not at his best when returning for the finals . When the 1934 season opened it was thought Doug Strang would be fully fit , but after one impressive match in the second round against St. Kilda , it was soon discovered that the knee required an operation to repair a slipped disc , and Strang did not play again until the fourteenth round against Carlton . After that , however , the disc incapacitated him once more and he was a passenger on the forward flank by the seventeenth round . These injuries meant Strang left Richmond during 1935 . In June 1935 , Strang was cleared to Kyneton Football Club where he took over the lease of the Junction Hotel , Kyneton . Strang was captain / coach of the Kyneton Football Club 's 1936 premiership team in Bendigo Football League , before returning to Albury as a hotelier in 1937 and playing in Albury Football Club 's 1937 premiership team .",
