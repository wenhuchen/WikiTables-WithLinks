  "/wiki/War_of_1812": "The War of 1812 was a conflict fought between the United States and the United Kingdom , with their respective allies , from June 1812 to February 1815 . Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars ; historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right . From the outbreak of war with Napoleonic France , Britain had enforced a naval blockade to choke off neutral trade to France , which the US contested as illegal under international law . To man the blockade , Britain pressed American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy . American sentiment grew increasingly hostile toward Britain due to incidents such as the Chesapeake-Leopard affair , which happened five years before the war . The British were in turn outraged by the Little Belt affair in 1811 , in which 11 British sailors died . Britain supplied arms to American Indians who raided American settlers on the frontier , hindering American expansion and provoking resentment . Historians debate whether the desire to annex some or all of British North America ( Canada ) contributed to the American decision to go to war . However , the Western interest was in expansion into American territories such as Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , and Wisconsin , where they were threatened by Indians supported by the British . On June 18 , 1812 , President James Madison signed into law the American declaration of war , after heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress . With most of its army in Europe fighting Napoleon , Britain adopted a defensive strategy , with offensive operations initially limited to the border and the western frontier . American prosecution of the war effort suffered from its unpopularity , especially in New England , where it was referred to as Mr. Madison 's War .",
  "/wiki/Burlington_Heights_(Ontario)": "Burlington Heights refers to a promontory or area of flat land sitting elevated ( at about 100 metres ( 330 ft ) ) above the west end of Hamilton Harbour in the city of Hamilton , Ontario which continues as a peninsula to the north toward the city of Burlington , Ontario .

  "/wiki/Picturesque": "Picturesque is an aesthetic ideal introduced into English cultural debate in 1782 by William Gilpin in Observations on the River Wye , and Several Parts of South Wales , etc . Relative Chiefly to Picturesque Beauty ; made in the Summer of the Year 1770 , a practical book which instructed Englands leisured travellers to examine the face of a country by the rules of picturesque beauty . Picturesque , along with the aesthetic and cultural strands of Gothic and Celticism , was a part of the emerging Romantic sensibility of the 18th century . The term picturesque needs to be understood in relationship to two other aesthetic ideals : the beautiful and the sublime . By the last third of the 18th century , Enlightenment and rationalist ideas about aesthetics were being challenged by looking at the experiences of beauty and sublimity as non-rational . Aesthetic experience was not just a rational decision - one did not look at a pleasing curved form and decide it was beautiful ; rather it came naturally as a matter of basic human instinct . Edmund Burke in his 1757 A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful argued that the soft gentle curves appealed to the male sexual desire , while the sublime horrors appealed to our desires for self-preservation . Picturesque arose as a mediator between these opposed ideals of beauty and the sublime , showing the possibilities that existed between these two rationally idealized states . As Thomas Gray wrote in 1765 of the Scottish Highlands : The mountains are ecstatic [ \u2026 ] . None but those monstrous creatures of God know how to join so much beauty with so much horror .

  "/wiki/Carpenter_Gothic": "Carpenter Gothic , also sometimes called Carpenter 's Gothic or Rural Gothic , is a North American architectural style-designation for an application of Gothic Revival architectural detailing and picturesque massing applied to wooden structures built by house-carpenters . The abundance of North American timber and the carpenter-built vernacular architectures based upon it made a picturesque improvisation upon Gothic a natural evolution . Carpenter Gothic improvises upon features that were carved in stone in authentic Gothic architecture , whether original or in more scholarly revival styles ; however , in the absence of the restraining influence of genuine Gothic structures , the style was freed to improvise and emphasize charm and quaintness rather than fidelity to received models . The genre received its impetus from the publication by Alexander Jackson Davis of Rural Residences and from detailed plans and elevations in publications by Andrew Jackson Downing .",

  "/wiki/Custom_House": "A custom house or customs house was traditionally a building housing the offices for a jurisdictional government whose officials oversaw the functions associated with importing and exporting goods into and out of a country , such as collecting customs duty on imported goods . A custom house was typically located in a seaport or in a city on a major river , with access to an ocean . These cities acted as a port of entry into a country . As of 2019 [ update ] , the Custom House of Valletta in Malta is still used for its originally built purpose . Due to advances in electronic information systems , the increased volume of international trade , and the introduction of air travel , the term custom house became a historical anachronism .

  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",

This period is also colloquially referred to as Between the Wars . Despite the relatively short period of time , this period represented an era of significant changes worldwide . Petroleum-based energy production and associated mechanisation expanded dramatically leading to the Roaring Twenties , a period of economic prosperity and growth for the middle class in North America , Europe and many other parts of the world . Automobiles , electric lighting , radio broadcasts and more became commonplace among populations in the developed world . The indulgences of this era subsequently were followed by the Great Depression , an unprecedented worldwide economic downturn which severely damaged many of the world 's largest economies . Politically , this era coincided with the rise of communism , starting in Russia with the October Revolution and Russian Civil War , at the end of World War I , and ended with the rise of fascism , particularly in Germany and in Italy . China was in the midst of a half-century of instability and civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China .

A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other .

Upper Canada included all of modern-day Southern Ontario and all those areas of Northern Ontario in the Pays d'en Haut which had formed part of New France , essentially the watersheds of the Ottawa River or Lakes Huron and Superior , excluding any lands within the watershed of Hudson Bay . The upper prefix in the name reflects its geographic position along the Great Lakes , mostly above the headwaters of the Saint Lawrence River , contrasted with Lower Canada ( present-day Quebec ) to the northeast . It was the primary destination of Loyalist refugees and settlers from the United States after the American Revolution , who often were granted land to settle in Upper Canada . The province was characterized by its British way of life , including bicameral parliament and separate civil and criminal law , rather than mixed as in Lower Canada or elsewhere in the British Empire . The division was created to ensure the exercise of the same rights and privileges enjoyed by loyal subjects elsewhere in the North American colonies . In 1812 , war broke out between Great Britain and the United States , leading to several battles in Upper Canada . The US had hoped to capture Upper Canada , but the war ended with the situation unchanged . The government of the colony came to be dominated by a small group of persons , known as the Family Compact , who held most of the top positions in the Legislative Council and appointed officials . In 1837 , an unsuccessful rebellion attempted to overthrow the undemocratic system . Representative government would be established in the 1840s . Upper Canada existed from its establishment on 26 December 1791 to 10 February 1841 , when it was united with adjacent Lower Canada to form the Province of Canada .",

The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay , which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna . The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond ; Virginia Beach is the most populous city , and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision . The Commonwealth 's estimated population as of 2018 [ update ] is over 8.5 million . The area 's history begins with several indigenous groups , including the Powhatan . In 1607 the London Company established the Colony of Virginia as the first permanent English colony in the New World . Virginia 's state nickname , the Old Dominion , is a reference to this status . Slave labor and the land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each played a significant role in the colony 's early politics and plantation economy . Virginia was one of the 13 Colonies in the American Revolution . In the American Civil War , Virginia 's Secession Convention resolved to join the Confederacy , and Virginia 's First Wheeling Convention resolved to remain in the Union ; that led to the creation of West Virginia .

Not literally a railroad , the workers ( both black and white , free and enslaved ) who secretly aided the fugitives are also collectively referred to as the Underground Railroad . Various other routes led to Mexico , where slavery had been abolished , or overseas . An earlier escape route running south toward Florida , then a Spanish possession ( except 1763-83 ) , existed from the late 17th century until Florida became a United States territory in 1821 . One of the main reasons Florida was purchased by the United States was to end its function as a safe haven for escaped slaves . However , the network now generally known as the Underground Railroad was formed in the late 1700s . It ran north and grew steadily until the Civil War began . One estimate suggests that by 1850 , 100,000 slaves had escaped via the Railroad . British North America ( present-day Canada ) was a desirable destination , as its long border gave many points of access , it was further from slave catchers , and beyond the reach of the United States ' Fugitive Slave Acts . Most former slaves , reaching Canada by boat across Lake Erie and Lake Ontario , settled in Ontario .

  "/wiki/Victorian_era": "In the history of the United Kingdom , the Victorian era was the period of Queen Victoria 's reign , from 20 June 1837 until her death on 22 January 1901 . The era followed the Georgian period and preceded the Edwardian period , and its later half overlaps with the first part of the Belle \u00c9poque era of Continental Europe . In terms of moral sensibilities and political reforms , this period began with the passage of the Reform Act 1832 . There was a strong religious drive for higher moral standards led by the nonconformist churches , such as the Methodists , and the Evangelical wing of the established Church of England . Britain 's relations with the other Great Powers were driven by the colonial antagonism of the Great Game with Russia , climaxing during the Crimean War ; a Pax Britannica of international free trade was maintained by the country 's naval and industrial supremacy . Britain embarked on global imperial expansion , particularly in Asia and Africa , which made the British Empire the largest empire in history . National self-confidence peaked . Ideologically , the Victorian era witnessed resistance to the rationalism that defined the Georgian period and an increasing turn towards romanticism and even mysticism with regard to religion , social values , and arts . Domestically , the political agenda was increasingly liberal , with a number of shifts in the direction of gradual political reform , social reform , and the widening of the franchise . There were unprecedented demographic changes : the population of England and Wales almost doubled from 16.8 million in 1851 to 30.5 million in 1901 , and Scotland 's population also rose rapidly , from 2.8 million in 1851 to 4.4 million in 1901 . However , Ireland 's population decreased sharply , from 8.2 million in 1841 to less than 4.5 million in 1901 , mostly due to emigration and the Great Famine .

Designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1984 , she now serves as a museum ship berthed next to HMCS Star , an active Royal Canadian Naval Reserve Division , in Hamilton , Ontario . In 2018 , Haida was designated the ceremonial flagship of the RCN .",
  "/wiki/Tribal-class_destroyer_(1936)": "The Tribal class , or Afridi class , were a class of destroyers built for the Royal Navy , Royal Canadian Navy and Royal Australian Navy that saw service in World War II . Originally conceived during design studies for a light fleet cruiser , the Tribals evolved into fast , powerful destroyers , with greater emphasis on guns over torpedoes than previous destroyers , in response to new designs by Japan , Italy , and Germany . The Tribals were well admired by their crews and the public when they were in service due to their power , often becoming symbols of prestige while in service . As some of the Royal Navy 's most modern and powerful escort ships , the Tribal class served with distinction in nearly all theatres of World War II . Only a handful of Royal Navy Tribals survived the war , all of which were subsequently scrapped from hard use , while Commonwealth Tribals continued to serve into the Cold War , serving with distinction in the Korean War . Only one Tribal survives to this day : HMCS Haida , which is now a museum ship in Hamilton Harbour , Ontario , Canada .",
  "/wiki/Museum_ship": "A museum ship , also called a memorial ship , is a ship that has been preserved and converted into a museum open to the public for educational or memorial purposes . Some are also used for training and recruitment purposes , mostly for the small number of museum ships that are still operational and thus capable of regular movement . Several hundred museum ships are kept around the world , with around 175 of them organised in the Historic Naval Ships Association though many are not naval museum ships , from general merchant ships to tugs and lightships . Many , if not most , museum ships are also associated with a maritime museum .",

Among the many Hamilton civic leaders and boosters , McQuesten helped encourage McMaster University to relocate from downtown Toronto to west Hamilton in 1930 , and was instrumental in the creation of the Royal Botanical Gardens .",
  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",

  "/wiki/Botanical_garden": "A botanical garden or botanic garden [ nb 1 ] is a garden dedicated to the collection , cultivation , preservation and display of a wide range of plants labelled with their botanical names . It may contain specialist plant collections such as cacti and other succulent plants , herb gardens , plants from particular parts of the world , and so on ; there may be greenhouses , shadehouses , again with special collections such as tropical plants , alpine plants , or other exotic plants . Visitor services at a botanical garden might include tours , educational displays , art exhibitions , book rooms , open-air theatrical and musical performances , and other entertainment . Botanical gardens are often run by universities or other scientific research organizations , and often have associated herbaria and research programmes in plant taxonomy or some other aspect of botanical science . In principle , their role is to maintain documented collections of living plants for the purposes of scientific research , conservation , display , and education , although this will depend on the resources available and the special interests pursued at each particular garden . The origin of modern botanical gardens is generally traced to the appointment of professors of botany to the medical faculties of universities in 16th century Renaissance Italy , which also entailed the curation of a medicinal garden . However , the objectives , content , and audience of today 's botanic gardens more closely resembles that of the grandiose gardens of antiquity and the educational garden of Theophrastus in the Lyceum of ancient Athens . The early concern with medicinal plants changed in the 17th century to an interest in the new plant imports from explorations outside Europe as botany gradually established its independence from medicine . In the 18th century , systems of nomenclature and classification were devised by botanists working in the herbaria and universities associated with the gardens , these systems often being displayed in the gardens as educational order beds . With the rapid rise of European imperialism in the late 18th century , botanic gardens were established in the tropics , and economic botany became a focus with the hub at the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew , near London . Over the years , botanical gardens , as cultural and scientific organisations , have responded to the interests of botany and horticulture . Nowadays , most botanical gardens display a mix of the themes mentioned and more ; having a strong connection with the general public , there is the opportunity to provide visitors with information relating to the environmental issues being faced at the start of the 21st century , especially those relating to plant conservation and sustainability .",
  "/wiki/Cultivar": "A cultivar [ nb 1 ] ( cultivated variety ) is an assemblage of plants selected for desirable characteristics that are maintained during propagation . More generally , a cultivar is the most basic classification category of cultivated plants in the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants ( ICNCP ) . Most cultivars arose in cultivation , but a few are special selections from the wild . Popular ornamental garden plants like roses , camellias , daffodils , rhododendrons , and azaleas are cultivars produced by careful breeding and selection for floral colour and form . Similarly , the world 's agricultural food crops are almost exclusively cultivars that have been selected for characters such as improved yield , flavour , and resistance to disease , and very few wild plants are now used as food sources . Trees used in forestry are also special selections grown for their enhanced quality and yield of timber . Cultivars form a major part of Liberty Hyde Bailey 's broader group , the cultigen , which is defined as a plant whose origin or selection is primarily due to intentional human activity . A cultivar is not the same as a botanical variety , which is a taxonomic rank below subspecies , and there are differences in the rules for creating and using the names of botanical varieties and cultivars . In recent times , the naming of cultivars has been complicated by the use of statutory patents for plants and recognition of plant breeders ' rights . The International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants ( UPOV - French : Union internationale pour la protection des obtentions v\u00e9g\u00e9tales ) offers legal protection of plant cultivars to persons or organisations that introduce new cultivars to commerce . UPOV requires that a cultivar be distinct , uniform , and stable . To be distinct , it must have characters that easily distinguish it from any other known cultivar .",

  "/wiki/Convention_on_Biological_Diversity": "The Convention on Biological Diversity ( CBD ) , known informally as the Biodiversity Convention , is a multilateral treaty . The Convention has three main goals including : the conservation of biological diversity ( or biodiversity ) ; the sustainable use of its components ; and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from genetic resources . In other words , its objective is to develop national strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity . It is often seen as the key document regarding sustainable development . The Convention was opened for signature at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro on 5 June 1992 and entered into force on 29 December 1993 . CBD has two supplementary agreements - Cartagena Protocol and Nagoya Protocol . The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity is an international treaty governing the movements of living modified organisms ( LMOs ) resulting from modern biotechnology from one country to another . It was adopted on 29 January 2000 as a supplementary agreement to the Convention on Biological Diversity and entered into force on 11 September 2003 . The Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization ( ABS ) to the Convention on Biological Diversity is a supplementary agreement to the Convention on Biological Diversity . It provides a transparent legal framework for the effective implementation of one of the three objectives of the CBD : the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources . The Nagoya Protocol on ABS was adopted on 29 October 2010 in Nagoya , Japan and entered into force on 12 October 2014 , 90 days after the deposit of the fiftieth instrument of ratification . Its objective is the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources , thereby contributing to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture_in_Canada": "Gothic Revival architecture in Canada is an historically influential style , with many prominent examples . The Gothic Revival was imported to Canada from Britain and the United States in the early 19th century , and rose to become the most popular style for major projects throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries . The Gothic Revival period lasted longer and was more thoroughly embraced in Canada than in either Britain or the United States , only falling out of style in the 1930s . The late 19th and early 20th centuries was also the period when many major Canadian institutions were founded . Throughout Canada many of the most prominent religious , civic , and scholastic institutions are housed in Gothic Revival style buildings . In the 1960s and 1970s several scholars , most notably Alan Gowans , embraced Canadian Gothic Revival architecture as one of the nation 's signature styles and as an integral part of Canadian nationalism . While largely abandoned in the modernist period , several postmodern architects have embraced Canada 's neo-Gothic past .",

  "/wiki/Sheet_metal": "Sheet metal is metal formed by an industrial process into thin , flat pieces . Sheet metal is one of the fundamental forms used in metalworking , and it can be cut and bent into a variety of shapes . Countless everyday objects are fabricated from sheet metal . Thicknesses can vary significantly ; extremely thin sheets are considered foil or leaf , and pieces thicker than 6 mm ( 0.25 in ) are considered plate steel or structural steel . Sheet metal is available in flat pieces or coiled strips . The coils are formed by running a continuous sheet of metal through a roll slitter . In most of the world , sheet metal thickness is consistently specified in millimeters . In the US , the thickness of sheet metal is commonly specified by a traditional , non-linear measure known as its gauge . The larger the gauge number , the thinner the metal . Commonly used steel sheet metal ranges from 30 gauge to about 7 gauge . Gauge differs between ferrous ( iron-based ) metals and nonferrous metals such as aluminum or copper . Copper thickness , for example , is measured in ounces , representing the weight of copper contained in an area of one square foot ."
