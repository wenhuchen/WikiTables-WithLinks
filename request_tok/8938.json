The original Chrysler Corporation was founded in 1925 by Walter Chrysler from the remains of the Maxwell Motor Company . In 1998 , it was acquired by Daimler-Benz , and the holding company was renamed DaimlerChrysler . After Daimler divested Chrysler in 2007 , the company existed as Chrysler LLC ( 2007-2009 ) and Chrysler Group LLC ( 2009-2014 ) before merging in 2014 with Italian holding company Fiat S.p.A. and becoming a subsidiary of its successor Fiat Chrysler Automobiles . In addition to the Chrysler brand , FCA sells vehicles worldwide under the Dodge , Jeep , and Ram nameplates . Furthermore , the subsidiary includes Mopar , its automotive parts and accessories division , and SRT , its performance automobile division . After founding the company , Walter Chrysler used the General Motors brand diversification and hierarchy strategy that he had seen working for Buick , and acquired Fargo Trucks and Dodge Brothers , and created the Plymouth and DeSoto brands in 1928 . Facing postwar declines in market share , productivity , and profitability , as GM and Ford were growing , Chrysler borrowed $ 250 million in 1954 from Prudential Insurance to pay for expansion and updated car designs . Chrysler expanded into Europe by taking control of French , British and Spanish auto companies in the 1960s ; Chrysler Europe was sold in 1978 to PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn for $ 1 . The company struggled to adapt to changing markets , increased U.S. import competition , and safety and environmental regulation in the 1970s . It began an engineering partnership with Mitsubishi Motors , and began selling Mitsubishi vehicles branded as Dodge and Plymouth in North America . On the verge of bankruptcy in the late 1970s , it was saved by $ 1.5 billion in loan guarantees from the U.S. government .",

Later in the same year , he won the Breeders ' Cup Classic and was voted American Champion Three-Year-Old Colt and American Horse of the Year . Sunday Silence 's racing career was marked by his rivalry with Easy Goer , whom he had a three to one edge over in their head-to-head races . Easy Goer , the 1988 American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt finished second to Sunday Silence in the Kentucky Derby by \u200b2 1\u20442 lengths , Preakness by a nose and Breeders ' Cup Classic by a neck . Easy Goer prevailed by eight lengths in the Belmont . Both horses were later voted into the American Hall of Fame . After his retirement from racing , Sunday Silence attracted little support by breeders in the United States and was exported to Japan . He was Leading Sire in Japan on thirteen occasions , surpassing the previous record of ten titles by Northern Taste . Although the relatively insular nature of Japanese racing at the time meant that Sunday Silence 's success was initially restricted to his home territory , his descendants have in recent years won major races in Australia , France , the United Kingdom , Hong Kong , the United States and Dubai . Blood-Horse pedigree expert Anne Peters speculated , Had Sunday Silence retired in Kentucky , it 's almost certain he would have tanked commercially and been exported in disgrace , but he found his perfect gene pool and thrived instead . He was also the leading broodmare sire in North America in 2016 due to his son Lani 's qualification of entry in the Kentucky Derby that year with a Grade II win in Dubai , followed by off the board finishes in the Derby and Preakness , and a third-place finish in the Belmont .",

On May 20 , 2006 , Barbaro ran in the Preakness Stakes as a heavy favorite , but , after a false start , he fractured three bones in and around the fetlock of his right hind leg . The injury ruined any chance of a Triple Crown in 2006 and ended his racing career . The next day , he underwent surgery at the New Bolton Center at the University of Pennsylvania for his injuries . In July he developed laminitis in his left rear foot . He was rushed to the hospital , where he underwent five further operations , and his prognosis varied during an exceptionally long stay in the Equine Intensive Care Unit at the New Bolton Center . While his right hind leg eventually healed , a final risky procedure on it proved futile because the colt soon developed further laminitis in both front hooves . His veterinarians and owners concluded that he could not be saved , and Barbaro was euthanized on January 29 , 2007 . He was a third-generation descendant of Mr. Prospector , and as such Barbaro was related to many notable racehorses including Afleet Alex , Smarty Jones , Funny Cide and Fusaichi Pegasus .",
