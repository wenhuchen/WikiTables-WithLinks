  "/wiki/Root_River_(Minnesota)": "The Root River flows for 80 miles ( 130 km ) through the Driftless Area of southeastern Minnesota and is a tributary of the Upper Mississippi River . It is an excellent river for canoeing . The gentle to moderate flowing river drops an average of 3.4 ft/mile from Chatfield , Minnesota , to its pour point in the Mississippi River into Navigation Pool 7 just south of La Crosse , Wisconsin . The South Branch rises in Mower County as agricultural drainage ditches , which disappear underground , re-emerging as a much cooler stream at Mystery Cave near Preston , Minnesota . The 48\u00b0F water creates superb conditions for brook trout . The river lies within Minnesota 's Driftless Area , a region which missed being glaciated during the last ice age , i.e. , the Wisconsinian glaciation .

  "/wiki/Cantilever_bridge": "A cantilever bridge is a bridge built using cantilevers , structures that project horizontally into space , supported on only one end . For small footbridges , the cantilevers may be simple beams ; however , large cantilever bridges designed to handle road or rail traffic use trusses built from structural steel , or box girders built from prestressed concrete . The steel truss cantilever bridge was a major engineering breakthrough when first put into practice , as it can span distances of over 1,500 feet ( 460 m ) , and can be more easily constructed at difficult crossings by virtue of using little or no falsework .",
  "/wiki/Arch_bridge": "An arch bridge is a bridge with abutments at each end shaped as a curved arch .

With an estimated size of approximately 44 million in 2016 , German Americans are the largest of the self-reported ancestry groups by the US Census Bureau in its American Community Survey . German-Americans account for about one third of the total ethnic German population in the world . None of the German states had American colonies . In the 1670s , the first significant groups of German immigrants arrived in the British colonies , settling primarily in Pennsylvania , New York , and Virginia . Immigration continued in very large numbers during the 19th century , with eight million arrivals from Germany . Between 1820 and 1870 more than seven and a half million German immigrants came to the United States . By 2010 , their population grew to 49.8 million German Americans , reflecting a jump of six million people since 2000 . There is a German belt that extends all the way across the United States , from eastern Pennsylvania to the Oregon coast . Pennsylvania has the largest population of German-Americans in the U.S. and is home to one of the group 's original settlements , Germantown ( Philadelphia ) , founded in 1683 and the birthplace of the American antislavery movement in 1688 , as well as the revolutionary Battle of Germantown . The state of Pennsylvania has 3.5 million people of German ancestry . They were pulled by the attractions of land and religious freedom , and pushed out of Germany by shortages of land and religious or political oppression .",

  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",

  "/wiki/Art_Deco": "Art Deco , sometimes referred to as Deco , is a style of visual arts , architecture and design that first appeared in France just before World War I . Art Deco influenced the design of buildings , furniture , jewelry , fashion , cars , movie theatres , trains , ocean liners , and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners . It took its name , short for Arts D\u00e9coratifs , from the Exposition internationale des arts d\u00e9coratifs et industriels modernes ( International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts ) held in Paris in 1925 . It combined modern styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials . During its heyday , Art Deco represented luxury , glamour , exuberance , and faith in social and technological progress . Art Deco was a pastiche of many different styles , sometimes contradictory , united by a desire to be modern . From its outset , Art Deco was influenced by the bold geometric forms of Cubism and the Vienna Secession ; the bright colors of Fauvism and of the Ballets Russes ; the updated craftsmanship of the furniture of the eras of Louis Philippe I and Louis XVI ; and the exotic styles of China and Japan , India , Persia , ancient Egypt and Maya art . It featured rare and expensive materials , such as ebony and ivory , and exquisite craftsmanship . The Chrysler Building and other skyscrapers of New York built during the 1920s and 1930s are monuments of the Art Deco style . In the 1930s , during the Great Depression , Art Deco became more subdued . New materials arrived , including chrome plating , stainless steel , and plastic . A sleeker form of the style , called Streamline Moderne , appeared in the 1930s ; it featured curving forms and smooth , polished surfaces .",
  "/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration": "The Works Progress Administration ( WPA ; renamed in 1939 as the Work Projects Administration ) was an American New Deal agency , employing millions of job-seekers ( mostly unskilled men ) to carry out public works projects , including the construction of public buildings and roads . It was established on May 6 , 1935 , by Executive Order 7034 . In one project , Federal Project Number One , the WPA employed musicians , artists , writers , actors and directors in large arts , drama , media , and literacy projects . The five projects dedicated to these were : the Federal Writers Project ( FWP ) , the Historical Records Survey ( HRS ) , the Federal Theatre Project ( FTP ) , the Federal Music Project ( FMP ) , and the Federal Art Project ( FAP ) . In the Historical Records Survey , for instance , many former slaves in the South were interviewed ; these documents are of great importance for American history . Theater and music groups toured throughout the United States , and gave more than 225,000 performances . Archaeological investigations under the WPA were influential in the rediscovery of pre-Columbian Native American cultures , and the development of professional archaeology in the US . The WPA 's initial appropriation in 1935 was for $ 4.9 billion ( about 6.7 percent of the 1935 GDP ) . Headed by Harry Hopkins , the WPA provided jobs and income to the unemployed during the Great Depression in the United States , while developing infrastructure to support the current and future society . Above all , the WPA hired workers and craftsmen who were mainly employed in building streets . Thus , under the leadership of the WPA , more than 1 million km of streets and over 10,000 bridges were built , in addition to many airports and much housing . The largest single project of the WPA was the Tennessee Valley Authority , which provided the impoverished Tennessee Valley with dams and waterworks to create an infrastructure for electrical power .",

Both were designed by C. G. Maybury & Son of Winona . In the late nineteenth century there was considerable disagreement about the location of the Houston County seat . In 1874 , Caledonia was named and construction soon began on the jail and sheriff 's residence . By 1882 planning began on the courthouse . Construction was by Noonan and Stellwager at a cost of $ 60,000 , and the building was completed in 1885 . Taxpayers criticized the expense of ornamental carpentry and five chandeliers , while county taxes doubled . The current building includes additions built in 1965 and 1977 .

  "/wiki/Romanesque_Revival_architecture": "Romanesque Revival ( or Neo-Romanesque ) is a style of building employed beginning in the mid-19th century inspired by the 11th- and 12th-century Romanesque architecture . Unlike the historic Romanesque style , however , Romanesque Revival buildings tended to feature more simplified arches and windows than their historic counterparts . An early variety of Romanesque Revival style known as Rundbogenstil ( Round-arched style ) was popular in German lands and in the German diaspora beginning in the 1830s . By far the most prominent and influential American architect working in a free Romanesque manner was Henry Hobson Richardson . In the United States , the style derived from examples set by him are termed Richardsonian Romanesque , of which not all are Romanesque Revival . Romanesque Revival is also sometimes referred to as the Norman style or Lombard style , particularly in works published during the 19th century after variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards , respectively . Like its influencing Romanesque style , the Romanesque Revival style was widely used for churches , and occasionally for synagogues such as the New Synagogue of Strasbourg built in 1898 , and the Congregation Emanu-El of New York built in 1929 . The style was quite popular for university campuses in the late 19th and early 20th century , especially in the United States and Canada ; well known examples can be found at the University of California , Los Angeles , University of Southern California , Tulane University , University of Denver , University of Toronto , and Wayne State University .",

  "/wiki/Wheat": "Wheat is a grass widely cultivated for its seed , a cereal grain which is a worldwide staple food . The many species of wheat together make up the genus Triticum ; the most widely grown is common wheat ( T. aestivum ) . The archaeological record suggests that wheat was first cultivated in the regions of the Fertile Crescent around 9600 BCE . Botanically , the wheat kernel is a type of fruit called a caryopsis . Wheat is grown on more land area than any other food crop ( 220.4 million hectares , 2014 ) . World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined . In 2017 , world production of wheat was 772 million tonnes , with a forecast of 2019 production at 766 million tonnes , making it the second most-produced cereal after maize . Since 1960 , world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st century . Global demand for wheat is increasing due to the unique viscoelastic and adhesive properties of gluten proteins , which facilitate the production of processed foods , whose consumption is increasing as a result of the worldwide industrialization process and the westernization of the diet . Wheat is an important source of carbohydrates . Globally , it is the leading source of vegetable protein in human food , having a protein content of about 13% , which is relatively high compared to other major cereals but relatively low in protein quality for supplying essential amino acids . When eaten as the whole grain , wheat is a source of multiple nutrients and dietary fiber .",

In architecture the Eastlake Style or Eastlake architecture is part of the Queen Anne style of Victorian architecture . Eastlake 's book Hints on Household Taste in Furniture , Upholstery , and Other Details posited that furniture and decor in people 's homes should be made by hand or machine workers who took personal pride in their work . Manufacturers in the United States used the drawings and ideas in the book to create mass-produced Eastlake Style or Cottage furniture .

  "/wiki/Schech's_Mill": "Schech 's Mill is a historic mill in Houston County , Minnesota , United States . It is one of three watermills in Minnesota still operating solely with water power and the only one to have its original millstones . Built by John Blinn in 1876 , it was purchased by a Minneapolis miller , Michael Schech who had emigrated from Bavaria , Germany . The mill produced cornmeal , rye buckwheat , wheat flour , graham flour , and whole wheat cereal , which was sold in Caledonia and Houston , Minnesota . Schech 's Mill is unique in the state for retaining intact and operable machinery from the 1870s , after the middlings purifier had been introduced but before millstones were supplanted by roller mills . In 1922 , a concrete dam was built to replace the original wooden one . Schech Mill is situated in the Driftless Area - a region of the American Midwest noted for its deeply carved river valleys . Private tours of the mill can be arranged most summer weekends which include an authentic flour grinding demonstration .",
  "/wiki/Watermill": "A watermill or water mill is a mill that uses hydropower . It is a structure that uses a water wheel or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling ( grinding ) , rolling , or hammering . Such processes are needed in the production of many material goods , including flour , lumber , paper , textiles , and many metal products . These watermills may comprise gristmills , sawmills , paper mills , textile mills , hammermills , trip hammering mills , rolling mills , wire drawing mills . One major way to classify watermills is by wheel orientation ( vertical or horizontal ) , one powered by a vertical waterwheel through a gear mechanism , and the other equipped with a horizontal waterwheel without such a mechanism . The former type can be further divided , depending on where the water hits the wheel paddles , into undershot , overshot , breastshot and pitchback ( backshot or reverse shot ) waterwheel mills . Another way to classify water mills is by an essential trait about their location : tide mills use the movement of the tide ; ship mills are water mills onboard ( and constituting ) a ship . Watermills impact the river dynamics of the watercourses where they are installed . During the time watermills operate channels tend to sedimentate , particularly backwater . Also in the backwater area , inundation events and sedimentation of adjacent floodplains increase . Over time however these effects are cancelled by river banks becoming higher . Where mills have been removed , river incision increases and channels deepen .",
  "/wiki/Millstone": "Millstones or mill stones are stones used in gristmills , for grinding wheat or other grains . Millstones come in pairs . The base or bedstone is stationary . Above the bedstone is the turning runner stone which actually does the grinding . The runner stone spins above the stationary bedstone creating the scissoring or grinding action of the stones . A runner stone is generally slightly concave , while the bedstone is slightly convex . This helps to channel the ground flour to the outer edges of the stones where it can be gathered up . The runner stone is supported by a cross-shaped metal piece ( rind or rynd ) fixed to a mace head topping the main shaft or spindle leading to the driving mechanism of the mill ( wind , water ( including tide ) or other means ) .",

Based on classification defined in Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips ' 1958 book Method and Theory in American Archaeology , the Oneota culture belongs to formative stage . The culture is believed to have transitioned into various Siouan cultures of the protohistoric and historic times , such as the Ioway [ citation needed ] . A long-accepted ancestry to the Ho-chunk has yet to be conclusively demonstrated . Oneota is considered a major component of Upper Mississippian culture . It is characterized by globular , shell-tempered pottery that is often coarse in fibre . Pieces often had a spherical body , short necks and/or a flat lip . Sometimes the vessels had strap handles . Decoration includes wavy and zigzag lines , often in parallel . Most decoration was done on the top half of the vessel . Analytically , the culture has been broken down into various stages or horizons . Generally accepted are the following :"
