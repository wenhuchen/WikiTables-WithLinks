  "/wiki/Diggi-Loo_Diggi-Ley": "Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley was the winning song in the Eurovision Song Contest 1984 performed in Swedish by a trio of brothers named Herrey 's . Lyrics were written by Britt Lindeborg , and the tune by Torgny S\u00f6derberg . It was produced by Anders Engberg and Torgny S\u00f6derberg . The song is a perfect illustration of the time period in which it was performed ; a very upbeat 1980s-style dance song , performed by three impossibly clean cut young men - fellow Swedish Eurovision participant Tommy K\u00f6rberg famously dubbed them the dancing deodorants in the press , a derogatory nickname that stuck with them for the rest of their career in their home country - and the nonsensical title harking back to previous entries such as Boom Bang-a-Bang , Ding-a-dong and La , la , la . The song has achieved considerable fame among Eurovision Song Contest fans , with a well-known archive of Contest lyrics using the domain name diggiloo.net , named after it . Despite the reception the song receives today , in the run-up to the Contest it was not an immediate favorite to win ; bookmakers Ladbrokes had Ireland 's Terminal 3 and Italy 's I treni di Tozeur as higher favourites , so the song winning came as a surprise to many . According to author John Kennedy O'Connor 's The Eurovision Song Contest - The Official History , The Herrey 's opened the contest and thus became the third winners of the competition to sing from pole position , following Teach-In in 1975 and Brotherhood of Man in 1976 . No song sung first or second has won since . The song itself deals with the lead singer discovering a pair of golden shoes in the street one day . He puts them on and immediately feels like dancing in the street , entering a magical world . Thus , he wishes for everyone to have a pair . The English translation , released some time after the Contest , took much the same theme , titling the song Golden Shoes .",
