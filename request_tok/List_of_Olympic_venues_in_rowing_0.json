  "/wiki/1900_Summer_Olympics": "The 1900 Summer Olympics ( French : Les Jeux olympiques d'\u00e9t\u00e9 de 1900 ) , today officially known as the Games of the II Olympiad , was an international multi-sport event that took place in Paris , France , in 1900 . No opening or closing ceremonies were held ; competitions began on 14 May and ended on 28 October . The Games were held as part of the 1900 World 's Fair . In total , 997 competitors took part in 19 different sports . This number relies on certain assumptions about which events were and were not Olympic . Many athletes , among them some who won events , did n't know that they had competed in the Olympic Games . Women took part in the games for the first time , and sailor H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Pourtal\u00e8s , born Helen Barbey in New York City , became the first female Olympic champion . The decision to hold competitions on a Sunday brought protests from many American athletes , who travelled as representatives of their colleges and were expected to withdraw rather than compete on their religious day of rest . At the Sorbonne conference of 1894 , Pierre de Coubertin proposed that the Olympic Games should take place in 1900 in Paris . The delegates to the conference were unwilling to wait six years and lobbied to hold the first games in 1896 . A decision was made to hold the first Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens and that Paris would host the second celebration . Most of the winners in 1900 did not receive medals , but were given cups or trophies .",

It rises at Source-Seine , 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) northwest of Dijon in northeastern France in the Langres plateau , flowing through Paris and into the English Channel at Le Havre ( and Honfleur on the left bank ) . It is navigable by ocean-going vessels as far as Rouen , 120 kilometres ( 75 mi ) from the sea . Over 60 percent of its length , as far as Burgundy , is negotiable by commercial riverboats , and nearly its whole length is available for recreational boating ; excursion boats offer sightseeing tours of the river banks in Paris , lined with top monuments including Notre-Dame , the Eiffel Tower , the Louvre Museum and Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay . There are 37 bridges within Paris and dozens more spanning the river outside the city . Examples in Paris include the Pont Alexandre III and Pont Neuf , the latter of which dates back to 1607 . Outside the city , examples include the Pont de Normandie , one of the longest cable-stayed bridges in the world , which links Le Havre to Honfleur .",

It was the first time that the Olympic Games were held outside Europe . Boxing , the oldest combat sport , was introduced . Tensions caused by the Russo-Japanese War and the difficulty of getting to St. Louis in 1904 may have contributed to the fact that very few top ranked athletes from outside the US and Canada took part in these Games . Only 62 of the 651 athletes who competed came from outside North America , and only 12-15 nations were represented in all . Some events combined the U.S. national championship with the Olympic championship . The current three-medal ( gold , silver , and bronze for first , second , and third places ) format was introduced at the 1904 Olympics .",

The regatta lasts for five days ( Wednesday to Sunday ) ending on the first weekend in July . Races are head-to-head knock out competitions , raced over a course of 1 mile 550 yards ( 2,112 m ) . The regatta regularly attracts international crews to race . The most prestigious event at the regatta is the Grand Challenge Cup for Men 's Eights , which has been awarded since the regatta was first staged . As the regatta pre-dates any national or international rowing organisation , it has its own rules and organisation , although it is recognised by both British Rowing ( the governing body of rowing in England and Wales ) and FISA ( the International Federation of Rowing Associations ) . The regatta is organised by a self-electing body of Stewards , who are largely former rowers themselves . Pierre de Coubertin modelled elements of the organisation of the International Olympic Committee on the Henley Stewards . The regatta is regarded as part of the English social season . As with other events in the season , certain enclosures at the regatta have strict dress codes .",

The games were the first to be televised , and radio broadcasts reached 41 countries . Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl was commissioned by the German Olympic Committee to film the Games for $ 7 million . Her film , titled Olympia , pioneered many of the techniques now common in the filming of sports . Hitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy and antisemitism , and the official Nazi party paper , the V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter , wrote in the strongest terms that Jews should not be allowed to participate in the Games . German Jewish athletes were barred or prevented from taking part by a variety of methods , although some women swimmers from the Jewish sports club , Hakoah Vienna , did take part . Jewish athletes from other countries seem to have been side-lined in order not to offend the Nazi regime . Total ticket revenues were 7.5 million Reichsmark , generating a profit of over one million \u211b\u2133 .

These Games were the first to be staged in the Southern Hemisphere and Oceania , as well as the first to be held outside Europe and North America . Melbourne is the most southerly city ever to host the Olympics . Due to the Southern Hemisphere 's seasons being different from those in the Northern Hemisphere , the 1956 Games did not take place at the usual time of year , because of the need to hold the events during the warmer weather of the host 's spring/summer ( which corresponds to the Northern Hemisphere 's autumn/winter ) .

  "/wiki/Lake_Albano": "Lake Albano ( Italian : Lago Albano or Lago di Castel Gandolfo ) is a small volcanic crater lake in the Alban Hills of Lazio , at the foot of Monte Cavo , 20 km ( 12 mi ) southeast of Rome . Castel Gandolfo , overlooking the lake , is the site of the Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo . In Roman times it was known as Albanus Lacus and lay not far from the ancient city of Alba Longa . With a depth of about 170 m ( 560 ft ) , Lake Albano is the deepest in Lazio . The lake is 3.5 km ( 2.2 mi ) long by 2.3 km ( 1.4 mi ) wide , and was formed by the overlapping union of two volcanic craters , an origin indicated by the ridge in its center , which rises to a height of 70 m ( 230 ft ) . Plutarch reports that in 406 BC the lake surged over the surrounding hills , despite there being no rain nor tributaries flowing into the lake to account for the rise in water level . The ensuing flood destroyed fields and vineyards before eventually pouring into the sea . It is thought to have been caused by volcanic gases , trapped in sediment at the bottom of the lake and gradually building up until suddenly releasing , causing the water to overflow . Around 395 BC , during the wars between Rome and Veii , a discharge tunnel was built crossing the crater walls . It served as an emissary whenever the water level overflowed its mouth . According to Titus Livius , this feat of engineering was incited by the Oracle of Delphi : the Roman victory against Veii would be possible only when the lake waters were channeled and used for irrigation . The emissary is at 293 meters over the sea level .",

Tokyo had been awarded the organization of the 1940 Summer Olympics , but this honour was subsequently passed to Helsinki because of Japan 's invasion of China , before ultimately being cancelled because of World War II . The 1964 Summer Games were the first Olympics held in Asia , and the first time South Africa was barred from taking part due to its apartheid system in sports . ( South Africa was , however , allowed to compete at the 1964 Summer Paralympics , also held in Tokyo , where it made its Paralympic Games debut . ) Tokyo was chosen as the host city during the 55th IOC Session in West Germany , on 26 May 1959 . These games were also the first to be telecast internationally without the need for tapes to be flown overseas , as they had been for the 1960 Olympics four years earlier . The games were telecast to the United States using Syncom 3 , the first geostationary communication satellite , and from there to Europe using Relay 1 . These were also the first Olympic Games to have color telecasts , albeit partially . Certain events like the sumo wrestling and judo matches , sports huge in Japan , were tried out using Toshiba 's new colour transmission system , but only for the domestic market . History surrounding the 1964 Olympics was chronicled in the 1965 documentary film Tokyo Olympiad , directed by Kon Ichikawa . The games were scheduled for mid-October to avoid the city 's midsummer heat and humidity and the September typhoon season . The previous Olympics in Rome in 1960 started in late August and experienced hot weather .",

The borough is centered on the formerly independent city of Xochimilco , which was established on what was the southern shore of Lake Xochimilco in the pre-Hispanic period . Today , the borough consists of the eighteen barrios or neighborhoods of this city along with fourteen pueblos or villages that surround it , covering an area of 125 km2 ( 48 sq mi ) . The borough is in the southeastern part of the city and has an identity that is separate from the historic center of Mexico City , due to its historic separation from that city during most of its history . Xochimilco is best known for its canals , which are left from what was an extensive lake and canal system that connected most of the settlements of the Valley of Mexico . These canals , along with artificial islands called chinampas , attract tourists and other city residents to ride on colorful gondola-like boats called trajineras around the 170 km ( 110 mi ) of canals . This canal and chinampa system , as a vestige of the area 's pre-Hispanic past , has made Xochimilco a World Heritage Site . In 1950 , Paramahansa Yogananda in his Autobiography of a Yogi wrote that if there were a scenic beauty contest , Xochimilco would get the first prize . However , severe environmental degradation of the canals and chinampas has brought that status into question .",
