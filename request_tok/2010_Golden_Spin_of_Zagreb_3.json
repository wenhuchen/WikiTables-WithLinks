  "/wiki/Short_dance": "The short dance ( SD ) was the first segment of an ice dancing competition from the 2010-2011 to the 2017-2018 seasons . It was approved in June 2010 by the International Skating Union ( ISU ) . It merged the original dance ( OD ) and compulsory dance ( CD ) , which were both discontinued . The ISU re-named the short dance to the rhythm dance ( RD ) in 2018 . The SD was composed of two parts : the pattern dance ( formerly known as the compulsory dance ) , which lasted about one minute and could be placed anywhere in the SD , and the creative section , which took up most of the SD . The pattern dance changed each year , and was announced beforehand by the ISU . The ISU also published yearly rule changes . Ice dancers were expected to perform five required elements in their SD : two segments of the pattern dance , one short lift , a step sequence , and a set of twizzles . At first , the duration of the SD was two minutes and 50 seconds ; in 2016 , it was changed to two minutes and 40 seconds . The first SD in international competitions was performed by U.S. junior ice dancers Anastasia Cannuscio and Colin McManus .",

At the end of the Western Roman Empire the Germanic tribal confederations migrated from Central Europe , invaded the Iberian peninsula and established relatively independent realms in its western provinces , including the Suebi , Alans and Vandals .",

The Neo-Assyrian Empire destroyed Israel around 720 BCE . Judah was later conquered by the Babylonian , Persian and Hellenistic empires and had existed as Jewish autonomous provinces . The successful Maccabean Revolt led to an independent Hasmonean kingdom by 110 BCE , which in 63 BCE however became a client state of the Roman Republic that subsequently installed the Herodian dynasty in 37 BCE , and in 6 CE created the Roman province of Judea . Judea lasted as a Roman province until the failed Jewish revolts resulted in widespread destruction , the expulsion of the Jewish population and the renaming of the region from Iudaea to Syria Palaestina . Jewish presence in the region has persisted to a certain extent over the centuries . In the 7th century CE , the Levant was taken from the Byzantine Empire by the Arabs and remained in Muslim control until the First Crusade of 1099 , followed by the Ayyubid conquest of 1187 .",

The territory of modern Hungary was for centuries inhabited by a succession of peoples , including Celts , Romans , Germanic tribes , Huns , West Slavs and the Avars . The foundations of the Hungarian state were established in the late ninth century CE by the Hungarian grand prince \u00c1rp\u00e1d following the conquest of the Carpathian Basin . His great-grandson Stephen I ascended the throne in 1000 , converting his realm to a Christian kingdom . By the 12th century , Hungary became a regional power , reaching its cultural and political height in the 15th century . Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 , Hungary was partially occupied by the Ottoman Empire ( 1541-1699 ) . It came under Habsburg rule at the turn of the 18th century , and later joined Austria to form the Austro-Hungarian Empire , a major European power . The Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed after World War I , and the subsequent Treaty of Trianon established Hungary 's current borders , resulting in the loss of 71% of its territory , 58% of its population , and 32% of ethnic Hungarians ."
