  "/wiki/2006\u201307_Nashville_Predators_season": "The 2006-07 Nashville Predators season was the ninth National Hockey League season in Nashville , Tennessee . The Predators , looking to get past the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time in franchise history , bulked up their roster by signing star forward Jason Arnott , whose 76 points in 2005-06 was second on the Dallas Stars . With returning forwards Paul Kariya and Steve Sullivan , and the acquisition of Arnott and Jean-Pierre Dumont , the Predators were predicted to challenge the Detroit Red Wings for top spot in the Central Division . Although the Predators were leading the Central when the 55th National Hockey League All-Star Game was played in Dallas , Texas , only one Predator player was named to the Western Conference team . Defenseman and team captain Kimmo Timonen played in his second All-Star Game . Head Coach Barry Trotz served as an assistant coach for the Western Conference . The attendance in Nashville had been a topic of much media debate all season long , with the Predators ' attendance being in the bottom third of the league despite the team leading its division for most of the season . There had been much speculation in February about a clause in the Predators lease with the city that could force the city of Nashville to buy $ 2 million worth of tickets for the Predators in the 2007-08 season if the team failed to reach a paid average attendance of 14,000 . After 21 home games , the Predators were only averaging 12,766 in paid attendance . Team owner Craig Leipold had also announced that he was looking to sell up to 40% of the team to local interests ; however , he found no immediate takers . In February , the Predators acquired forward Peter Forsberg from the Philadelphia Flyers for Scottie Upshall , Ryan Parent and two draft picks . The deal paid immediate dividends at the gate : the Predators announced they had sold 3,500 tickets for their games in the first day after the trade was announced .",

Known for his on-ice vision and physical play , Forsberg is considered one of the greatest players of all time . Although his career was shortened by persistent injuries , as of 2014 , he stands eighth all-time in career points-per-game and fourth all-time in career assists-per-game in the NHL , only behind Wayne Gretzky , Mario Lemieux and Bobby Orr . In 2017 Forsberg was named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players ' in history . His 19-year professional career includes 13 years in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) , where he won two Stanley Cups with the Colorado Avalanche , as well as several individual honors including the Hart Memorial Trophy in 2003 .

  "/wiki/2007\u201308_Nashville_Predators_season": "The 2007-08 Nashville Predators season began October 4 , 2007 . It was their tenth season in the National Hockey League . The 2007 off-season was dominated by the attempted purchase of the Predators by Canadian businessman Jim Balsillie , who signed a letter of intent to purchase the team for at least $ 220 million . The attempted sale led to widespread speculation that Balsillie intended to relocate the team to Hamilton , Ontario , if the Predators failed to reach a 14,000 paid average attendance in 2007-08 , allowing the team to break its lease . Balsillie had already entered negotiations on a lease at Copps Coliseum in Hamilton . Despite calling the negotiations a contingency plan , Balsillie petitioned the NHL to decide on his ability to relocate the franchise at the same time the NHL Board of Governors voted on his purchase of the team . However , the deal was ended by Predators Owner Craig Leipold on June 22 , as he informed the NHL that he was pulling out of the agreement due to a lack of a finalized sale agreement and over concerns that Balsillie would relocate the team to Hamilton . On August 1 , a group led by local businessman David Freeman issued a letter of intent to purchase the Predators . The sale was approved by the Board of Governors on November 29 . In January , it was revealed that former Predators Owner Craig Leipold was purchasing the majority share in the Minnesota Wild . Key dates prior to the start of the season :",
