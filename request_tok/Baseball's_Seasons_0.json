But the louder buzz concerned the M & M boys , Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle , who spent the summer chasing the ghost of Babe Ruth and his 60-home run season of 1927 . Mantle finished with 54 while Maris set the record of 61 on the last day of the season . With all the attention surrounding the home run race , the World Series seemed almost anticlimatic . The Yankees were under the leadership of first-year manager Ralph Houk , who had succeeded Casey Stengel . The Yankees won the American League pennant , finishing eight games better than the Detroit Tigers . The Bronx Bombers also set a Major League record for most home runs in a season with 240 . Along with Maris and Mantle , four other Yankees , Yogi Berra , Elston Howard , Bill Skowron , and Johnny Blanchard , hit more than 20 home runs . The pitching staff was led by Cy Young Award-winner Whitey Ford ( 25-4 , 3.21 ) .

The Pirates have had many ups and downs during their long history , most famously winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a series-winning walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski , the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run . They also won the 1971 World Series , led by the talent of Roberto Clemente , and the 1979 World Series under the slogan We Are Family , led by Pops Willie Stargell . After a run of regular-season success in the early 1990s ( winning three straight NL East Division titles ) , the Pirates struggled mightily over the following 20 years , with 20 consecutive losing seasons from 1993 to 2012 - the longest such streak in American professional sports history - before posting a winning record in 2013 of 94-68 , qualifying them for the NL Wild Card .

This marked the second time in the 1970s the Pirates won a World Series Game 7 on the road against the Orioles , the previous time being in the 1971 World Series . The Pirates were famous for adopting Sister Sledge 's hit song We Are Family as their theme song during the 1979 season .

Grant Jackson pitched for the Orioles in the 1971 series and for the Pirates in the 1979 series . In this Series , it was the AL team 's turn to play by NL rules , meaning no designated hitter and the Orioles ' pitchers would have to bat . While this resulted in Tim Stoddard getting his first major league hit and runs batted in in Game 4 , overall , it hurt the Orioles because Lee May , their designated hitter for much of the season and a key part of their offense , was only able to bat three times in the whole series . Willie Stargell , who was named the World Series Most Valuable Player , hit .400 with a record seven extra-base hits and matched Reggie Jackson 's record of 25 total bases , set in 1977 .
