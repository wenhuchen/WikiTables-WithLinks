The choice of a site for these summit meetings is left entirely to the host nation. The location choices of host nations have been informed in some cases by perceived pre- and post-summit economic benefits. The serial accounts of these summits have tended to focus on international macro-consequences; but the host-country's decision-making has also seemed to focus on micro-consequences which have been otherwise overshadowed or overlooked."
