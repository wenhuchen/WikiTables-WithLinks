  "/wiki/Brine_shrimp": "Artemia is a genus of aquatic crustaceans also known as brine shrimp . Artemia , the only genus in the family Artemiidae , has changed little externally since the Triassic period . The first historical record of the existence of Artemia dates back to the first half of the 10th century AD from Urmia Lake , Iran , with an example called by an Iranian geographer an aquatic dog , although the first unambiguous record is the report and drawings made by Schl\u00f6sser in 1757 of animals from Lymington , England . Artemia populations are found worldwide in inland saltwater lakes , but not in oceans . Artemia are able to avoid cohabiting with most types of predators , such as fish , by their ability to live in waters of very high salinity ( up to 25% ) . The ability of the Artemia to produce dormant eggs , known as cysts , has led to extensive use of Artemia in aquaculture . The cysts may be stored for long periods and hatched on demand to provide a convenient form of live feed for larval fish and crustaceans . Nauplii of the brine shrimp Artemia constitute the most widely used food item , and over 2000 tonnes of dry Artemia cysts are marketed worldwide annually . In addition , the resilience of Artemia makes them ideal animals running biological toxicity assays and it has become a model organism used to test the toxicity of chemicals . Breeds of Artemia are sold as novelty gifts under the marketing name Sea-Monkeys or Aqua Dragons .",

Quill Lakes is Canada 's largest saline lake , covering an area of about 635 square kilometres ( 245 sq mi ) . Salinity varies within the lakes and with their water levels , but effectively limits the floral diversity of the region .
