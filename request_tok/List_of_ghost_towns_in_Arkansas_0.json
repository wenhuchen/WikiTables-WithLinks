  "/wiki/Arkansas_Post_National_Memorial": "The Arkansas Post ( French : Poste de Arkansea ) was the first European settlement in the lower Mississippi River Valley and present-day Arkansas when Henri de Tonti established it in 1686 as a French trading post on the banks of the lower Arkansas River . The French and Spanish traded with the Quapaw for years , and the post was of strategic value to the French , Spanish , and Americans . It was designated as the first capital of the Arkansas Territory in 1819 , but lost that status to Little Rock in 1821 . During the years of fur trading , Arkansas Post was protected by a series of forts . The forts and associated settlements were located at three known sites and possibly a fourth , as the waterfront area was prone to erosion and flooding . The land encompassing the second ( and fourth ) Arkansas Post site ( Red Bluff ) was designated as a state park in 1929 . In 1960 about 758 acres ( 307 ha ) of land at the site were protected as a National Memorial and National Historic Landmark ; it commemorates the history of several cultures and time periods : the Quapaw , the French settlers who inhabited the small entrep\u00f4t as the first Arkansans , Spanish rule , an American Revolutionary War skirmish in 1783 , the first territorial capital of Arkansas , and an American Civil War battle in 1863 . Three archeological excavations have been conducted at the site , beginning in the 1950s . Experts say the most extensive cultural resources at the site are archeological , both for the 18th and 19th-century settlements , and the earlier Quapaw villages . Due to changes in the river and navigation measures , the water level has risen closer to the height of the bluffs , which used to be well above the river . The site is now considered low lying . Erosion and construction on the river have resulted in the remains of three of the historic forts being under water in the river channel .",

While thriving as a town of nearly 2,000 residents along the Arkansas River up to the 1860s , the community was the site of significant Union troop occupation during the Civil War , from September 1863 through August 1865 . Lewisburg witnessed several guerrilla killings in the area , also common in surrounding communities throughout the river valley . A skirmish in early 1865 effectively ended war activity in the county , ahead of the surrender that would conclude the overall war . In the years immediately following the war , the community became unsettled amid conflict between local militia and the Ku Klux Klan in 1868 , leading to major fires in town and a declaration of martial law by Governor Powell Clayton in December 1868 .

  "/wiki/Zinc": "Zinc is a chemical element with the symbol Zn and atomic number 30 . Zinc is a slightly brittle metal at room temperature and has a blue-silvery appearance when oxidation is removed . It is the first element in group 12 of the periodic table . In some respects , zinc is chemically similar to magnesium : both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state ( +2 ) , and the Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions are of similar size . Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth 's crust and has five stable isotopes . The most common zinc ore is sphalerite ( zinc blende ) , a zinc sulfide mineral . The largest workable lodes are in Australia , Asia , and the United States . Zinc is refined by froth flotation of the ore , roasting , and final extraction using electricity ( electrowinning ) . Brass , an alloy of copper and zinc in various proportions , was used as early as the third millennium BC in the Aegean , Iraq , the United Arab Emirates , Kalmykia , Turkmenistan and Georgia , and the second millennium BC in West India , Uzbekistan , Iran , Syria , Iraq , and Israel/Palestine . Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India , though it was known to the ancient Romans and Greeks . The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC . To date , the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar , in Rajasthan , as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc .",

  "/wiki/List_of_F5_and_EF5_tornadoes": "Among the most violent known meteorological events are tornadoes . Each year , more than 2,000 tornadoes are recorded worldwide , with the vast majority occurring in the United States and Europe . In order to assess the intensity of these events , meteorologist Ted Fujita devised a method to estimate maximum winds within the storm based on damage caused ; this became known as the Fujita scale . At the top end of the scale , which ranks from 0 to 5 , are F5 tornadoes . These storms were estimated to have had winds between 260 mph ( 420 km/h ) and 318 mph ( 512 km/h ) . [ nb 1 ] Following two particularly devastating tornadoes in 1997 and 1999 , engineers questioned the reliability of the scale . Ultimately , a new scale was devised that took into account 28 different damage indicators ; this became known as the Enhanced Fujita scale . With building designs taken more into account , winds in an EF5 tornado were estimated to be in excess of 200 mph ( 320 km/h ) . Unlike North America , Europe however uses the TORRO tornado intensity scale ( or T-Scale ) a scale measuring tornado intensity between T0 and T11 , F5/EF5 tornadoes for the T scale are T10-T11 . In the United States , between 1950 and January 31 , 2007 there were 50 officially-rated F5 tornadoes , and since February 1 , 2007 there has been 9 officially-rated EF5 tornadoes .
