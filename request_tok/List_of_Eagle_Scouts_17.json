The actual number of aerial victories required to officially qualify as an ace has varied , but is usually considered to be five or more . The concept of the ace emerged in 1915 during World War I , at the same time as aerial dogfighting . It was a propaganda term intended to provide the home front with a cult of the hero in what was otherwise a war of attrition . The individual actions of aces were widely reported and the image was disseminated of the ace as a chivalrous knight reminiscent of a bygone era . For a brief early period when air-to-air combat was just being invented , the exceptionally skilled pilot could shape the battle in the skies . For most of the war , however , the image of the ace had little to do with the reality of air warfare , in which fighters fought in formation and air superiority depended heavily on the relative availability of resources .",
  "/wiki/Flying_Tigers": "The First American Volunteer Group ( AVG ) of the Chinese Air Force in 1941-1942 , nicknamed the Flying Tigers , was composed of pilots from the United States Army Air Corps ( USAAC ) , Navy ( USN ) , and Marine Corps ( USMC ) , recruited under President Franklin Roosevelt 's authority before Pearl Harbor and commanded by Claire Lee Chennault . Their P-40B aircraft , marked with Chinese colors , flew under American control . Their mission was to bomb Japan and defend China but many delays meant the AVG flew in combat after the US and Japan declared war . The group consisted of three fighter squadrons of around 30 aircraft each that trained in Burma before the American entry into World War II to defend China against Japanese forces . The AVG were officially members of the Chinese Air Force . The group had contracts with salaries ranging from $ 250 a month for a mechanic to $ 750 for a squadron commander , roughly three times what they had been making in the U.S. forces . While it accepted some civilian volunteers for its headquarters and ground crew , the AVG recruited most of its staff from the U.S. military . The group first saw combat on 20 December 1941 , 12 days after Pearl Harbor ( local time ) . It demonstrated innovative tactical victories when the news in the U.S. was filled with little more than stories of defeat at the hands of the Japanese forces and achieved such notable success during the lowest period of the war for both the U.S. and the Allied Forces as to give hope to America that it might eventually defeat Japan . AVG pilots earned official credit and received combat bonuses for destroying 296 enemy aircraft , while losing only 14 pilots in combat . The combat records of the AVG still exist and researchers have found them credible . On 4 July 1942 the AVG was disbanded and replaced by the 23rd Fighter Group of the United States Army Air Forces , which was later absorbed into the U.S. Fourteenth Air Force with General Chennault as commander .",

  "/wiki/Civil_rights_movement": "The civil rights movement ( also known as the American civil rights movement and other terms ) [ b ] in the United States was a decades-long struggle by African Americans to end legalized racial discrimination , disenfranchisement and racial segregation in the United States . The movement has its origins in the Reconstruction era during the late 19th century , although the movement achieved its largest legislative gains in the mid-1960s after years of direct actions and grassroots protests . The social movement 's major nonviolent resistance campaigns eventually secured new protections in federal law for the human rights of all Americans . After the American Civil War and the abolition of slavery in the 1860s , the Reconstruction Amendments to the United States Constitution granted emancipation and constitutional rights of citizenship to all African Americans , most of whom had recently been enslaved . For a period , African Americans voted and held political office , but they were increasingly deprived of civil rights , often under Jim Crow laws , and subjected to discrimination and sustained violence by whites in the South . Over the following century , various efforts were made by African Americans to secure their legal rights . In 1954 , the separate but equal policy which aided the enforcement of Jim Crow laws was weakened with the United States Supreme Court 's Brown v. Board of Education ruling and other subsequent rulings which followed . Between 1955 and 1968 , acts of nonviolent protest and civil disobedience produced crisis situations and productive dialogues between activists and government authorities . Federal , state , and local governments , businesses , and communities often had to respond immediately to these situations , which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans across the country . The lynching of Chicago teenager Emmett Till in Mississippi , and the outrage generated by seeing how he had been abused , when his mother decided to have an open-casket funeral , mobilized the African-American community nationwide . Forms of protest and/or civil disobedience included boycotts , such as the successful Montgomery bus boycott ( 1955-56 ) in Alabama ; sit-ins such as the Greensboro sit-ins ( 1960 ) in North Carolina and successful Nashville sit-ins in Tennessee ; marches , such as the 1963 Birmingham Children 's Crusade and 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches ( 1965 ) in Alabama ; and a wide range of other nonviolent activities . At the culmination of a legal strategy pursued by African Americans , the U.S. Supreme Court began , in 1954 under the leadership of Earl Warren , to find unconstitutional many of the laws that had allowed racial segregation and discrimination to be legal in the United States .",

A leading U.S. counter-terrorism , counterintelligence , and criminal investigative organization , the FBI has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes . Although many of the FBI 's functions are unique , its activities in support of national security are comparable to those of the British MI5 and the Russian FSB . Unlike the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , which has no law enforcement authority and is focused on intelligence collection abroad , the FBI is primarily a domestic agency , maintaining 56 field offices in major cities throughout the United States , and more than 400 resident agencies in smaller cities and areas across the nation . At an FBI field office , a senior-level FBI officer concurrently serves as the representative of the Director of National Intelligence . Despite its domestic focus , the FBI also maintains a significant international footprint , operating 60 Legal Attache ( LEGAT ) offices and 15 sub-offices in U.S. embassies and consulates across the globe . These foreign offices exist primarily for the purpose of coordination with foreign security services and do not usually conduct unilateral operations in the host countries . The FBI can and does at times carry out secret activities overseas , just as the CIA has a limited domestic function ; these activities generally require coordination across government agencies . The FBI was established in 1908 as the Bureau of Investigation , the BOI or BI for short . Its name was changed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) in 1935 . The FBI headquarters is the J.
