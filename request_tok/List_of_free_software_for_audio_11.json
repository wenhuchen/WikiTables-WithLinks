  "/wiki/Linux": "Linux ( /\u02c8l\u026an\u0259ks/ ( listen ) LIN-\u0259ks ) is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel , an operating system kernel first released on September 17 , 1991 , by Linus Torvalds . Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution . Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project . Many Linux distributions use the word Linux in their name , but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software , causing some controversy . Popular Linux distributions include Debian , Fedora , and Ubuntu . Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server . Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose . Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system . Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers ( since November 2017 , having gradually eliminated all competitors ) . It is used by around 2.3 percent of desktop computers .",
  "/wiki/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture": "Advanced Linux Sound Architecture ( ALSA ) is a software framework and part of the Linux kernel that provides an application programming interface ( API ) for sound card device drivers . Some of the goals of the ALSA project at its inception were automatic configuration of sound-card hardware and graceful handling of multiple sound devices in a system . ALSA is released under the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) and the GNU Lesser General Public License ( LGPL ) . The sound servers PulseAudio and JACK ( low-latency professional-grade audio editing and mixing ) , the higher-level abstraction APIs OpenAL , SDL audio , etc . work on top of ALSA and implemented sound card device drivers . On Linux systems , ALSA succeeded the older Open Sound System ( OSS ) .",
  "/wiki/Sound_card": "A sound card ( also known as an audio card ) is an internal expansion card that provides input and output of audio signals to and from a computer under control of computer programs . The term sound card is also applied to external audio interfaces used for professional audio applications . Sound functionality can also be integrated onto the motherboard , using components similar to those found on plug-in cards . The integrated sound system is often still referred to as a sound card . Sound processing hardware is also present on modern video cards with HDMI to output sound along with the video using that connector ; previously they used a S/PDIF connection to the motherboard or sound card . Typical uses of sound cards or sound card functionality include providing the audio component for multimedia applications such as music composition , editing video or audio , presentation , education and entertainment ( games ) and video projection . Sound cards are also used for computer-based communication such as voice over IP and teleconferencing .",
  "/wiki/Linux_kernel": "The Linux kernel is a free and open-source , monolithic , Unix-like operating system kernel . The Linux family of operating systems is based on this kernel and deployed on both traditional computer systems such as personal computers and servers , usually in the form of Linux distributions , and on various embedded devices such as routers , wireless access points , PBXes , set-top boxes , FTA receivers , smart TVs , PVRs , and NAS appliances . While the adoption of the Linux kernel in desktop computer operating system is low , Linux-based operating systems dominate nearly every other segment of computing , from mobile devices to mainframes . Since November 2017 [ update ] , all of the world 's 500 most powerful supercomputers run Linux . The Android operating system for tablet computers , smartphones , and smartwatches also uses the Linux kernel . The Linux kernel was conceived and created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds for his personal computer and with no cross-platform intentions , but has since expanded to support a huge array of computer architectures , many more than other kernels do . Linux rapidly attracted developers and users who adopted it as the kernel for other free software projects , notably the GNU Operating System , which was created as a free , non-proprietary operating system , and based on UNIX as a by-product of the fallout of the Unix wars . The Linux kernel API , the application programming interface ( API ) through which user programs interact with the kernel , is meant to be very stable and to not break userspace programs ( some programs , such as those with GUIs , rely on other APIs as well ) . As part of the kernel 's functionality , device drivers control the hardware ; mainlined ( included in the kernel ) device drivers are also meant to be very stable . However , the interface between the kernel and loadable kernel modules ( LKMs ) , unlike in many other kernels and operating systems , is not meant to be very stable by design . The Linux kernel , developed by contributors worldwide , is a prominent example of free and open source software . Day-to-day development discussions take place on the Linux kernel mailing list ( LKML ) .",
  "/wiki/ARts": "aRts ( which stands for analog real time synthesizer ) is an audio framework that is no longer under development . It was best known for previously being used in K Desktop Environment 2 and 3 to simulate an analog synthesizer . A key component of aRts was the sound server which mixes several sound streams in realtime . The sound server , called artsd ( d for daemon ) , was also utilized as the standard sound server for K Desktop Environment 2-3 . However , the sound server was not dependent on K Desktop Environment and can be used in other projects . It was a direct competitor to PulseAudio , another sound server , and an indirect competitor to the Enlightened Sound Daemon ( ESD ) . It is now common to use PulseAudio instead of artsd . The aRts platform also includes aRts Builder - an application for building custom layouts and configurations for audio mixers , sequencers , synthesizers and other audio schema via a user-friendly graphical user interface . aRts is free software , distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License .",
  "/wiki/Sound_server": "A sound server is software that manages the use of and access to audio devices ( usually a sound card ) . It commonly runs as a background process .",
  "/wiki/Disposable_Soft_Synth_Interface": "Disposable Soft Synth Interface ( DSSI ) is a virtual instrument ( software synthesizer ) plugin architecture for use by music sequencer applications . It was designed for applications running under Linux , although there is nothing specific to Linux in the interface itself . It is distributed under the terms of a combination of GNU Lesser General Public License and some BSD licenses , all of which are free software licences .",
  "/wiki/Software_synthesizer": "A software synthesizer , also known as a softsynth or software instrument , is a computer program or plug-in that generates digital audio , usually for music . Computer software that can create sounds or music is not new , but advances in processing speed now allow softsynths to accomplish the same tasks that previously required the dedicated hardware of a conventional synthesizer . Softsynths are usually cheaper and more portable than dedicated hardware , and easier to interface with other music software such as music sequencers .",
  "/wiki/GStreamer": "GStreamer is a pipeline-based multimedia framework that links together a wide variety of media processing systems to complete complex workflows . For instance , GStreamer can be used to build a system that reads files in one format , processes them , and exports them in another . The formats and processes can be changed in a plug and play fashion . GStreamer supports a wide variety of media-handling components , including simple audio playback , audio and video playback , recording , streaming and editing . The pipeline design serves as a base to create many types of multimedia applications such as video editors , transcoders , streaming media broadcasters and media players . It is designed to work on a variety of operating systems , e.g . Linux kernel-based operating systems , the BSDs , OpenSolaris , Android , macOS , iOS , Windows , OS/400 . GStreamer is free and open-source software subject to the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License ( LGPL ) and is being hosted at freedesktop.org .",
  "/wiki/JACK_Audio_Connection_Kit": "JACK Audio Connection Kit ( or JACK ; a recursive acronym ) is a professional sound server daemon that provides real-time , low-latency connections for both audio and MIDI data between applications that use its API . JACK has been developed by a community of open-source developers led by Paul Davis ( who won an Open Source Award in 2004 for this work ) and has been a key piece of infrastructure and the de facto standard for professional audio software on Linux since its inception in 2002 . The server is free software , licensed under the GNU GPL , while the library is licensed under the more permissive GNU LGPL .",
  "/wiki/Timebase": "A time base generators , or timebase , is a special type of function generator , an electronic circuit that generates a varying voltage to produce a particular waveform . Time base generators produce very high frequency sawtooth waves specifically designed to deflect the beam in cathode ray tube ( CRT ) smoothly across the face of the tube and then return it to its starting position . Time bases are used by radar systems to determine range to a target , by comparing the current location along the time base to the time of arrival of radio echoes . Analog television systems using CRTs had two time bases , one for deflecting the beam horizontally in a rapid movement , and another pulling it down the screen 60 times per second . Oscilloscopes often have several time bases , but these may be more flexible function generators able to produce many waveforms as well as a simple time base .",
  "/wiki/LADSPA": "LADSPA is an acronym for Linux Audio Developer 's Simple Plugin API . It is an application programming interface ( API ) standard for handling audio filters and audio signal processing effects , licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License ( LGPL ) . It was originally designed for Linux through consensus on the Linux Audio Developers Mailing List , but works on a variety of other platforms . It is used in many free audio software projects and there is a wide range of LADSPA plug-ins available . LADSPA exists primarily as a header file written in the programming language C. There are many audio plugin standards and most major modern software synthesizers and sound editors support a variety . The best known standard is probably Steinberg Cubase 's Virtual Studio Technology . LADSPA is unusual in that it attempts to provide only the Greatest Common Divisor of other standards . This means that its scope is limited , but it is simple and plugins written using it are easy to embed in many other programs . The standard has changed little with time , so compatibility problems are rare . DSSI extends LADSPA to cover instrument plugins . LV2 is a successor , based on LADSPA and DSSI , but permitting easy extensibility , allowing custom user interfaces , MIDI messages , and custom extensions .",
  "/wiki/Digital_signal_processor": "A digital signal processor ( DSP ) is a specialized microprocessor ( or a SIP block ) chip , with its architecture optimized for the operational needs of digital signal processing . DSPs are fabricated on MOS integrated circuit chips . They are widely used in audio signal processing , telecommunications , digital image processing , radar , sonar and speech recognition systems , and in common consumer electronic devices such as mobile phones , disk drives and high-definition television ( HDTV ) products . The goal of a DSP is usually to measure , filter or compress continuous real-world analog signals . Most general-purpose microprocessors can also execute digital signal processing algorithms successfully , but may not be able to keep up with such processing continuously in real-time . Also , dedicated DSPs usually have better power efficiency , thus they are more suitable in portable devices such as mobile phones because of power consumption constraints . DSPs often use special memory architectures that are able to fetch multiple data or instructions at the same time . DSPs often also implement data compression technology , with the discrete cosine transform ( DCT ) in particular being a widely used compression technology in DSPs .",
  "/wiki/Open_Sound_System": "The Open Sound System ( OSS ) is an interface for making and capturing sound in Unix and Unix-like operating systems . It is based on standard Unix devices system calls ( i.e . POSIX read , write , ioctl , etc. ) . The term also sometimes refers to the software in a Unix kernel that provides the OSS interface ; it can be thought of as a device driver ( or a collection of device drivers ) for sound controller hardware . The goal of OSS is to allow the writing of sound-based applications that are agnostic of the underlying sound hardware . OSS was created by Hannu Savolainen and is distributed under four license options , three of which are free software licences , thus making OSS free software .",
  "/wiki/Unix": "Unix ( /\u02c8ju\u02d0n\u026aks/ ; trademarked as UNIX ) is a family of multitasking , multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT & T Unix , development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson , Dennis Ritchie , and others . Initially intended for use inside the Bell System , AT & T licensed Unix to outside parties in the late 1970s , leading to a variety of both academic and commercial Unix variants from vendors including University of California , Berkeley ( BSD ) , Microsoft ( Xenix ) , IBM ( AIX ) , and Sun Microsystems ( Solaris ) . In the early 1990s , AT & T sold its rights in Unix to Novell , which then sold its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation ( SCO ) in 1995 . The UNIX trademark passed to The Open Group , a neutral industry consortium , which allows the use of the mark for certified operating systems that comply with the Single UNIX Specification ( SUS ) . Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the Unix philosophy : the operating system provides a set of simple tools that each performs a limited , well-defined function , with a unified filesystem ( the Unix filesystem ) as the main means of communication , and a shell scripting and command language ( the Unix shell ) to combine the tools to perform complex workflows . Unix distinguishes itself from its predecessors as the first portable operating system : almost the entire operating system is written in the C programming language , thus allowing Unix to reach numerous platforms .",
  "/wiki/Operating_systems": "An operating system ( OS ) is system software that manages computer hardware , software resources , and provides common services for computer programs . Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time , mass storage , printing , and other resources . For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation , the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware , although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it . Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer - from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers . The dominant desktop operating system is Microsoft Windows with a market share of around 82.74% . macOS by Apple Inc. is in second place ( 13.23% ) , and the varieties of Linux are collectively in third place ( 1.57% ) . In the mobile ( including smartphones and tablets ) sector , Google Android 's share is up to 70% in the year 2017 . According to third quarter 2016 data , Android 's share on smartphones is dominant with 87.5 percent with also a growth rate of 10.3 percent per year , followed by Apple 's iOS with 12.1 percent with per year decrease in market share of 5.2 percent , while other operating systems amount to just 0.3 percent . Linux distributions are dominant in the server and supercomputing sectors . Other specialized classes of operating systems , such as embedded and real-time systems , exist for many applications .",
