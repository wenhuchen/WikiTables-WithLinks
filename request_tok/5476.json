He has also won three gold medals and one bronze medal in the 2014 Winter Olympics . An is a six-time Overall World Champion for 2003-2007 and 2014 . After winning gold in Sochi , Ahn explained his reasons for joining the Russian team saying , I wanted to train in the best possible environment and I proved my decision was not wrong . As expected , a gold-winning athlete leaving the national team caused public uproar in South Korea . However , it was aimed not at Ahn , but at the country 's skating union . Most South Korean fans in a poll said they understood Ahn 's decision . Ahn received the Order For Merit to the Fatherland Award 4th class with Russian President Vladimir Putin handing the state awards . Ahn was banned from participating in the 2018 Olympic Games in his native South Korea following a decision by the IOC amidst alleged Russia 's sports doping scandal of 2016-2017 . The IOC did not disclose the specific reasons but mentioned lingering suspicions about doping use .",
