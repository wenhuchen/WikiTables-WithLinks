  "/wiki/ALGOL_60": "ALGOL 60 ( short for Algorithmic Language 1960 ) is a member of the ALGOL family of computer programming languages . It followed on from ALGOL 58 which had introduced code blocks and the begin and end pairs for delimiting them . ALGOL 60 was the first language implementing nested function definitions with lexical scope . It gave rise to many other programming languages , including CPL , Simula , BCPL , B , Pascal , and C. Niklaus Wirth based his own ALGOL W on ALGOL 60 before moving to develop Pascal . Algol-W was intended to be the next generation ALGOL but the ALGOL 68 committee decided on a design that was more complex and advanced rather than a cleaned simplified ALGOL 60 . The official ALGOL versions are named after the year they were first published . Algol 68 is substantially different from Algol 60 and was criticised partially for being so , so that in general Algol refers to dialects of Algol 60 .",
  "/wiki/COBOL": "COBOL ( /\u02c8ko\u028ab\u0252l , -b\u0254\u02d0l/ ; an acronym for common business-oriented language ) is a compiled English-like computer programming language designed for business use . It is imperative , procedural and , since 2002 , object-oriented . COBOL is primarily used in business , finance , and administrative systems for companies and governments . COBOL is still widely used in legacy applications deployed on mainframe computers , such as large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs . But due to its declining popularity and the retirement of experienced COBOL programmers , programs are being migrated to new platforms , rewritten in modern languages or replaced with software packages . Most programming in COBOL is now purely to maintain existing applications . COBOL was designed in 1959 by CODASYL and was partly based on previous programming language design work by Grace Hopper , commonly referred to as the ( grand ) mother of COBOL . It was created as part of a US Department of Defense effort to create a portable programming language for data processing . It was originally seen as a stopgap , but the Department of Defense promptly forced computer manufacturers to provide it , resulting in its widespread adoption . It was standardized in 1968 and has since been revised four times . Expansions include support for structured and object-oriented programming . The current standard is ISO/IEC 1989:2014 .",

This effort led to the development of the programming language COBOL and other technical standards . CODASYL 's members were individuals from industry and government involved in data processing activity . Its larger goal was to promote more effective data systems analysis , design , and implementation . The organization published specifications for various languages over the years , handing these over to official standards bodies ( ISO , ANSI , or their predecessors ) for formal standardization .",

He was one of the earliest researchers in computational linguistics and natural language processing , the use of computers to analyze and process languages . He created the first program to produce random but well-formed output sentences , given a text , a children 's book called Engineer Small and the Little Train . Most importantly , he showed in computer processing terms why the human brain can only process sentences of a certain kind of complexity , ones that do not exceed a depth limit ( which has nothing to do with length ) of the kind established independently by George Miller with his depth limit of seven plus or minus two sentence constituents in memory at any given time . Yngve was also the author of COMIT , the first string processing language ( compare SNOBOL , TRAC , and Perl ) , which was developed on the IBM 700/7000 series computers by Yngve and collaborators at MIT from 1957-1965 . Yngve created the language for supporting computerized research in the field of linguistics , and more specifically , the area of machine translation for natural language processing . In his 1970 paper On Getting a Word in Edgewise , Yngve coined the term 'back channel behavior ' to describe the conversational phenomenon that to this day is known in the linguistic literature as back-channeling . According to Duncan , Yngve 's paper also suggested the term turn-taking , independently of Erving Goffman ( Duncan , 1972 : 283 ) .",

Originally developed by IBM in the 1950s for scientific and engineering applications , FORTRAN came to dominate this area of programming early on and has been in continuous use for over six decades in computationally intensive areas such as numerical weather prediction , finite element analysis , computational fluid dynamics , computational physics , crystallography and computational chemistry . It is a popular language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world 's fastest supercomputers . Fortran encompasses a lineage of versions , each of which evolved to add extensions to the language while usually retaining compatibility with prior versions . Successive versions have added support for structured programming and processing of character-based data ( FORTRAN 77 ) , array programming , modular programming and generic programming ( Fortran 90 ) , high performance Fortran ( Fortran 95 ) , object-oriented programming ( Fortran 2003 ) , concurrent programming ( Fortran 2008 ) , and native parallel computing capabilities ( Coarray Fortran 2008/2018 ) . Fortran 's design was the basis for many other programming languages . Amongst the better-known is BASIC , which is based on FORTRAN II with a number of syntax cleanups , notably better logical structures , and other changes to work more easily in an interactive environment .",

  "/wiki/SNOBOL": "SNOBOL ( StriNg Oriented and symBOlic Language ) is a series of computer programming languages developed between 1962 and 1967 at AT & T Bell Laboratories by David J. Farber , Ralph E. Griswold and Ivan P. Polonsky , culminating in SNOBOL4 . It was one of a number of text-string-oriented languages developed during the 1950s and 1960s ; others included COMIT and TRAC . SNOBOL4 stands apart from most programming languages of its era by having patterns as a first-class data type ( i.e . a data type whose values can be manipulated in all ways permitted to any other data type in the programming language ) and by providing operators for pattern concatenation and alternation . SNOBOL4 patterns are a type of object and admit various manipulations , much like later object-oriented languages such as JavaScript whose patterns are known as regular expressions . In addition SNOBOL4 strings generated during execution can be treated as programs and either interpreted or compiled and executed ( as in the eval function of other languages ) . SNOBOL4 was quite widely taught in larger US universities in the late 1960s and early 1970s and was widely used in the 1970s and 1980s as a text manipulation language in the humanities . In the 1980s and 1990s its use faded as newer languages such as AWK and Perl made string manipulation by means of regular expressions fashionable . SNOBOL4 patterns subsume BNF grammars , which are equivalent to context-free grammars and more powerful than regular expressions . The regular expressions in current versions of AWK and Perl are in fact extensions of regular expressions in the traditional sense , but regular expressions , unlike SNOBOL4 patterns , are not recursive , which gives a distinct computational advantage to SNOBOL4 patterns . ( Recursive expressions did appear in Perl 5.10 , though , released in December 2007 . ) One of the designers of SNOBOL , Ralph Griswold , designed successors to SNOBOL4 called SL5 and Icon , which combined the backtracking of SNOBOL4 pattern matching with more standard ALGOL-like structuring , as well as adding some features of their own .",

  "/wiki/ALGOL_68": "ALGOL 68 ( short for Algorithmic Language 1968 ) is an imperative computer programming language that was conceived as a successor to the ALGOL 60 programming language , designed with the goal of a much wider scope of application and more rigorously defined syntax and semantics . The complexity of the language 's definition , which runs to several hundred pages filled with non-standard terminology , made compiler implementation difficult and it was said it had no implementations and no users . This was only partially true ; ALGOL 68 did find use in a number of niche markets , notably in the United Kingdom where it was popular on International Computers Limited ( ICL ) machines , and in teaching roles . Outside these circles , use was relatively limited . Nevertheless , the contributions of ALGOL 68 to the field of computer science have been deep , wide-ranging and enduring , although many of these contributions were only publicly identified when they had reappeared in subsequently developed programming languages . Many languages were developed specifically as a response to the perceived complexity of the language , the most notable being Pascal , or were reimplementations for specific roles , like Ada . Many languages of the 1970s trace their design specifically to ALGOL 68 , selecting some features while abandoning others that were considered too complex or out-of-scope for given roles . Among these is the language C , which was directly influenced by ALGOL 68 , especially by its strong typing and structures . Most modern languages trace at least some of their syntax to either C or Pascal , and thus directly or indirectly to ALGOL 68 .",

JOSS was initially implemented on the JOHNNIAC machine at Rand Corporation and put online in 1963 . It proved very popular , and the users quickly bogged the machine down . By 1964 a replacement was sought with higher performance . JOHNNIAC was retired in 1966 and replaced by a PDP-6 , which ultimately grew to support hundreds of computer terminals based on the IBM Selectric . The terminals used green ink for user input and black for the computer 's response . Any command that was not understood elicited the response Eh ? or SORRY . The system was highly influential , spawning a variety of ports and offshoots . Some remained similar to the original , like TELCOMP and STRINGCOMP , CAL , CITRAN , ISIS , PIL/I , JEAN ( ICT 1900 series ) , AID ( PDP-10 ) ; while others , such as FOCAL and MUMPS , developed in distinctive directions .

The original version was designed by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz and released at Dartmouth College in 1964 . They wanted to enable students in fields other than science and mathematics to use computers . At the time , nearly all use of computers required writing custom software , which was something only scientists and mathematicians tended to learn . In addition to the language itself , Kemeny and Kurtz developed the Dartmouth Time Sharing System ( DTSS ) , which allowed multiple users to edit and run BASIC programs at the same time . This general model became very popular on minicomputer systems like the PDP-11 and Data General Nova in the late 1960s and early 1970s . Hewlett-Packard produced an entire computer line for this method of operation , introducing the HP2000 series in the late 1960s and continuing sales into the 1980s . Many early video games trace their history to one of these versions of BASIC . The emergence of early microcomputers in the mid-1970s led to the development of the original Microsoft BASIC in 1975 . Due to the tiny main memory available on these machines , often 4 kB , a variety of Tiny BASIC dialects was also created . BASIC was available for almost any system of the era , and naturally became the de facto programming language for the home computer systems that emerged in the late 1970s . These machines almost always had a BASIC interpreter installed by default , often in the machine 's firmware or sometimes on a ROM cartridge .",

It was initially conceived to work on mainframes ( the only kind of computers at that time ) , and was subsequently ported to new platforms ( minicomputers , personal computers ) as they became available . The porting of the same code on different platforms was made easier by using Mortran metalanguage macros to face systems dependencies and compilers deficiencies and differences .

In the post-war era the lab focused primarily on non-weapon related nuclear physics , designing and building the first power-producing nuclear reactors , helping design the reactors used by the USA 's nuclear navy , and a wide variety of similar projects . In 1994 , the lab 's nuclear mission ended , and today it maintains a broad portfolio in basic science research , energy storage and renewable energy , environmental sustainability , supercomputing , and national security . UChicago Argonne , LLC , the operator of the laboratory , brings together the expertise of the University of Chicago ( the sole member of the LLC ) with Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. Argonne is a part of the expanding Illinois Technology and Research Corridor . Argonne formerly ran a smaller facility called Argonne National Laboratory-West ( or simply Argonne-West ) in Idaho next to the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory . In 2005 , the two Idaho-based laboratories merged to become the Idaho National Laboratory .",
