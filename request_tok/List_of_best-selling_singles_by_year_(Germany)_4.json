  "/wiki/Moldova": "Moldova ( /m\u0252l\u02c8do\u028av\u0259/ ( listen ) , sometimes UK : /\u02c8m\u0252ld\u0259v\u0259/ ) , officially the Republic of Moldova ( Romanian : Republica Moldova ) , is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe , bordered by Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north , east , and south . The capital city is Chi\u0219in\u0103u . Most of the Moldovan territory was a part of the Principality of Moldavia from the 14th century until 1812 , when it was ceded to the Russian Empire by the Ottoman Empire ( to which Moldavia was a vassal state ) and became known as Bessarabia . In 1856 , southern Bessarabia was returned to Moldavia , which three years later united with Wallachia to form Romania , but Russian rule was restored over the whole of the region in 1878 . During the 1917 Russian Revolution , Bessarabia briefly became an autonomous state within the Russian Republic , known as the Moldavian Democratic Republic . In February 1918 , the Moldavian Democratic Republic declared independence and then integrated into Romania later that year following a vote of its assembly . The decision was disputed by Soviet Russia , which in 1924 established , within the Ukrainian SSR , a Moldavian autonomous republic ( MASSR ) on partially Moldovan-inhabited territories to the east of Bessarabia . In 1940 , as a consequence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact , Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia to the Soviet Union , leading to the creation of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic ( Moldavian SSR ) , which included the greater part of Bessarabia and the westernmost strip of the former MASSR ( east of the Dniester River ) . On 27 August 1991 , as the dissolution of the Soviet Union was underway , the Moldavian SSR declared independence and took the name Moldova . The constitution of Moldova was adopted in 1994 . The strip of the Moldovan territory on the east bank of the Dniester has been under the de facto control of the breakaway government of Transnistria since 1990 . Due to a decrease in industrial and agricultural output following the dissolution of the Soviet Union , the service sector has grown to dominate Moldova 's economy and is over 60% of the nation 's GDP .",
