  "/wiki/Gauntlet_(1985_video_game)": "Gauntlet is a fantasy-themed hack and slash 1985 arcade game by Atari Games . It is noted as being one of the first multi-player dungeon crawl arcade games . The core design of Gauntlet comes from Dandy , a 1983 Atari 8-bit family dungeon crawl , which resulted in a threat of legal action . The arcade version of Gauntlet was released in November 1985 and was initially available only as a dedicated four-player cabinet . A total of 7,848 units were distributed . Atari later released a two-player cabinet variant in June 1986 , aimed at operators who could not afford or did not have sufficient space for the four-player version .",

  "/wiki/Dungeons_&_Dragons": "Dungeons & Dragons ( commonly abbreviated as D & D or DnD ) is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game ( RPG ) originally designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson . It was first published in 1974 by Tactical Studies Rules , Inc. ( TSR ) . The game has been published by Wizards of the Coast ( now a subsidiary of Hasbro ) since 1997 . It was derived from miniature wargames , with a variation of the 1971 game Chainmail serving as the initial rule system . D & D 's publication is commonly recognized as the beginning of modern role-playing games and the role-playing game industry . D & D departs from traditional wargaming by allowing each player to create their own character to play instead of a military formation . These characters embark upon imaginary adventures within a fantasy setting . A Dungeon Master ( DM ) serves as the game 's referee and storyteller , while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur , and playing the role of the inhabitants of the game world . The characters form a party and they interact with the setting 's inhabitants and each other . Together they solve dilemmas , engage in battles , and gather treasure and knowledge . In the process , the characters earn experience points ( XP ) in order to rise in levels , and become increasingly powerful over a series of separate gaming sessions . The early success of D & D led to a proliferation of similar game systems .",

  "/wiki/Gotcha_(video_game)": "Gotcha is an arcade game developed by Atari and released in October 1973 . It was the fourth game by the company , after the 1972 Pong , which marked the beginning of the commercial video game industry , and the 1973 Space Race and Pong Doubles . In the game , two players move through a maze , which continually changes over time . One player , the Pursuer , attempts to catch the other , the Pursued ; if they do , a point is scored , and the players reset positions . The game emits an electronic beeping sound , which increases in pace as the Pursuer gets closer to the Pursued , and each game lasts a set amount of time . Gotcha was designed by Allan Alcorn , the designer of Pong , and a prototype was constructed by Cyan Engineering , Atari 's semi-independent research and development subsidiary . Development began in July 1973 as part of Atari 's strategy to develop multiple types of games to separate themselves from their competitors , who they saw as focused primarily on creating Pong clones . The cabinet was designed by George Faraco , initially with the joysticks encased in pink domes meant to represent breasts . Although this design inspired the advertising flyer on which it appears behind a man chasing a woman in a nightdress , it was changed to use regular joysticks soon after release . The game was not commercially successful ; later sources have termed it as arousing little more than controversy , though one source claims it sold 3,000 units . In addition to the main black-and-white game , limited runs were produced of a tinted color version and a true multi-color version of the game ; the latter is believed to be the first color arcade game .",

  "/wiki/Gran_Trak_10": "Gran Trak 10 is an arcade game developed by Atari through its subsidiary Cyan Engineering , and released by Atari in May 1974 . In the game , a single player drives a car along a race track , viewed from above , avoiding walls of pylons and trying to pass as many checkpoints as possible before time runs out . The game is controlled with a steering wheel , accelerator and brake pedals , and a gear stick , and the car crashes and spins if it hits a pylon . Gran Trak 10 began development in late 1973 ; it was initially designed by Larry Emmons of Cyan , with the mechanical design handled by Eigen Systems , though after several design and production problems were uncovered during an initial small production run in March 1974 the design was overhauled by Allan Alcorn , the designer of Pong , with wider distribution beginning in May . The game 's circuits include possibly the first instance of integrated circuit-based read-only memory ( ROM ) , which thereafter became the standard for arcade games , replacing diode-stored graphics . Gran Trak 10 was developed during a time of several internal changes at Atari ; as a result communication problems led Atari to not accurately track the expense of manufacturing the game . It was initially sold to distributors for a net loss of US $ 100 per cabinet ; although this flaw was fixed it contributed to a total loss of $ 500,000 for the company that fiscal year , placing Atari in financial difficulties . The game itself was successful , and led to several versions of the game being produced in 1974 by Atari and its subsidiary Kee Games , including a smaller cabinet version titled Trak 10 and a two-player version titled Gran Trak 20 , as well as numerous later racing games . Gran Trak 10 was the first arcade car racing game , though Atari had released the drag racing game Space Race in 1973 , and a simple racing game , Wipeout , was included with the 1972 Magnavox Odyssey console .",

  "/wiki/Shooter_game": "Shooter games are a subgenre of action video game , which often test the player 's spatial awareness , reflexes , and speed in both isolated single player or networked multiplayer environments . Shooter games encompass many subgenres that have the commonality of focusing on the actions of the avatar engaging in combat with a weapon against both code-driven NPC enemies or other avatars controlled by other players . Usually this weapon is a firearm or some other long-range weapon , and can be used in combination with other tools such as grenades for indirect offense , armor for additional defense , or accessories such as telescopic sights to modify the behavior of the weapons . A common resource found in many shooter games is ammunition , armor or health , or upgrades which augment the player character 's weapons . Most commonly , the purpose of a shooter game is to shoot opponents and proceed through missions without the player character being killed or dying as a result of the player 's actions . A shooting game is a genre of video game where the focus is almost entirely on the defeat of the character 's enemies using the weapons given to the player .",
