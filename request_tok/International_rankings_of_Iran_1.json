  "/wiki/Telephone": "A telephone ( derived from the Greek : \u03c4\u1fc6\u03bb\u03b5 , t\u0113le , far and \u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03ae , ph\u014dn\u0113 , voice , together meaning distant voice ) , or phone , is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be heard directly . A telephone converts sound , typically and most efficiently the human voice , into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another telephone which reproduces the sound to the receiving user . In 1876 , Alexander Graham Bell was the first to be granted a United States patent for a device that produced clearly intelligible replication of the human voice . This instrument was further developed by many others . The telephone was the first device in history that enabled people to talk directly with each other across large distances . Telephones rapidly became indispensable to businesses , government and households . The essential elements of a telephone are a microphone ( transmitter ) to speak into and an earphone ( receiver ) which reproduces the voice in a distant location . In addition , most telephones contain a ringer to announce an incoming telephone call , and a dial or keypad to enter a telephone number when initiating a call to another telephone . The receiver and transmitter are usually built into a handset which is held up to the ear and mouth during conversation . The dial may be located either on the handset or on a base unit to which the handset is connected . The transmitter converts the sound waves to electrical signals which are sent through a telephone network to the receiving telephone , which converts the signals into audible sound in the receiver or sometimes a loudspeaker . Telephones are duplex devices , meaning they permit transmission in both directions simultaneously .",

Originally a network of fixed-line analog telephone systems , the PSTN is now almost entirely digital in its core network and includes mobile and other networks , as well as fixed telephones . The technical operation of the PSTN adheres to the standards created by the ITU-T . These standards allow different networks in different countries to interconnect seamlessly . The E.163 and E.164 standards provide a single global address space for telephone numbers . The combination of the interconnected networks and the single numbering plan allow telephones around the world to dial each other .",
  "/wiki/Digitizing": "Digitization , less commonly digitalization , is the process of converting information into a digital ( i.e . computer-readable ) format , in which the information is organized into bits . The result is the representation of an object , image , sound , document or signal ( usually an analog signal ) by generating a series of numbers that describe a discrete set of points or samples . The result is called digital representation or , more specifically , a digital image , for the object , and digital form , for the signal . In modern practice , the digitized data is in the form of binary numbers , which facilitate computer processing and other operations , but , strictly speaking , digitizing simply means the conversion of analog source material into a numerical format ; the decimal or any other number system that can be used instead . Digitization is of crucial importance to data processing , storage and transmission , because it allows information of all kinds in all formats to be carried with the same efficiency and also intermingled . Though analog data is typically more stable , digital data can more easily be shared and accessed and can , in theory , be propagated indefinitely , provided it is migrated to stable formats as needed . This is why it is a favored way of preserving information for many organisations around the world .",

The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City ; other main offices are in Geneva , Nairobi , Vienna and The Hague . The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars , succeeding the ineffective League of Nations . On 25 April 1945 , 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter , which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945 , when the UN began operations . Pursuant to the Charter , the organization 's objectives include maintaining international peace and security , protecting human rights , delivering humanitarian aid , promoting sustainable development , and upholding international law . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; this number grew to 193 in 2011 , representing the vast majority of the world 's sovereign states . The organization 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies . Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring , reporting and confidence-building roles . UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s . Since then , 80 former colonies have gained independence , including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council .

  "/wiki/Mobile_phone": "A mobile phone , cellular phone , cell phone , cellphone , or hand phone , sometimes shortened to simply mobile , cell or just phone , is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency link while the user is moving within a telephone service area . The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator , which provides access to the public switched telephone network ( PSTN ) . Modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network architecture , and , therefore , mobile telephones are called cellular telephones or cell phones , in North America . In addition to telephony , 2000s-era mobile phones support a variety of other services , such as text messaging , MMS , email , Internet access , short-range wireless communications ( infrared , Bluetooth ) , business applications , video games , and digital photography . Mobile phones offering only those capabilities are known as feature phones ; mobile phones which offer greatly advanced computing capabilities are referred to as smartphones . The development of metal-oxide-semiconductor ( MOS ) large-scale integration ( LSI ) technology , information theory and cellular networking led to the development of affordable mobile communications . The first handheld mobile phone was demonstrated by John F. Mitchell and Martin Cooper of Motorola in 1973 , using a handset weighing c. 2 kilograms ( 4.4 lbs ) . In 1979 , Nippon Telegraph and Telephone ( NTT ) launched the world 's first cellular network in Japan .

  "/wiki/E-Government": "E-government ( short for electronic government ) is the use of technological communications devices , such as computers and the Internet to provide public services to citizens and other persons in a country or region . E-government offers new opportunities for more direct and convenient citizen access to government , and for government provision of services directly to citizens . The term consists of the digital interactions between a citizen and their government ( C2G ) , between governments and other government agencies ( G2G ) , between government and citizens ( G2C ) , between government and employees ( G2E ) , and between government and businesses/commerces ( G2B ) . E-government delivery models can be broken down into the following categories : This interaction consists of citizens communicating with all levels of government ( city , state/province , national , and international ) , facilitating citizen involvement in governance using information and communication technology ( ICT ) ( such as computers and websites ) and business process re-engineering ( BPR ) . Brabham and Guth ( 2017 ) interviewed the third party designers of e-government tools in North America about the ideals of user interaction that they build into their technologies , which include progressive values , ubiquitous participation , geolocation , and education of the public .

  "/wiki/Terrestrial_television": "Terrestrial television is a type of television broadcasting in which the television signal is transmitted by radio waves from the terrestrial ( Earth-based ) transmitter of a television station to a TV receiver having an antenna . The term terrestrial is more common in Europe and Latin America , while in the United States it is called broadcast or over-the-air television ( OTA ) . The term terrestrial is used to distinguish this type from the newer technologies of satellite television ( direct broadcast satellite or DBS television ) , in which the television signal is transmitted to the receiver from an overhead satellite , cable television , in which the signal is carried to the receiver through a cable , and Internet Protocol television , in which the signal is received over an Internet stream or on a network utilizing the Internet Protocol . Terrestrial television stations broadcast on television channels with frequencies between about 52 and 600 MHz in the VHF and UHF bands . Since radio waves in these bands travel by line of sight , reception is limited by the visual horizon to distances of 40-60 miles ( 64-97 km ) . Terrestrial television was the first technology used for television broadcasting . The BBC began broadcasting in 1929 and by 1930 many radio stations had a regular schedule of experimental television programmes . However , these early experimental systems had insufficient picture quality to attract the public , due to their mechanical scan technology , and television did not become widespread until after World War II with the advent of electronic scan television technology . The television broadcasting business followed the model of radio networks , with local television stations in cities and towns affiliated with television networks , either commercial ( in the US ) or government-controlled ( in Europe ) , which provided content . Television broadcasts were in black and white until the transition to color television in the 1950s and 60s . There was no other method of television delivery until the 1950s with the beginnings of cable television and community antenna television ( CATV ) . CATV was , initially , only a re-broadcast of over-the-air signals .",
  "/wiki/Television_studio": "A television studio , also called a television production studio , is an installation room in which video productions take place , either for the recording of live television to video tape , or for the acquisition of raw footage for post-production . The design of a studio is similar to , and derived from , movie studios , with a few amendments for the special requirements of television production . A professional television studio generally has several rooms , which are kept separate for noise and practicality reasons . These rooms are connected via 'talkback ' or an intercom , and personnel will be divided among these workplaces .",
  "/wiki/Television_channel": "A television channel is a terrestrial frequency or virtual number over which a television station or television network is distributed . For example , in North America , channel 2 refers to the terrestrial or cable band of 54 to 60 MHz , with carrier frequencies of 55.25 MHz for NTSC analog video ( VSB ) and 59.75 MHz for analog audio ( FM ) , or 55.31 MHz for digital ATSC ( 8VSB ) . Channels may be shared by many different television stations or cable-distributed channels depending on the location and service provider Depending on the multinational bandplan for a given regional n , analog television channels are typically 6 , 7 , or 8 MHz in bandwidth , and therefore television channel frequencies vary as well . Channel numbering is also different . Digital terrestrial television channels are the same as their analog predecessors for legacy reasons , however through multiplexing , each physical radio frequency ( RF ) channel can carry several digital subchannels . On satellites , each transponder normally carries one channel , however multiple small , independent channels can be on one transponder , with some loss of bandwidth due to the need for guard bands between unrelated transmissions . ISDB , used in Japan and Brazil , has a similar segmented mode . Preventing interference between terrestrial channels in the same area is accomplished by skipping at least one channel between two analog stations ' frequency allocations . Where channel numbers are sequential , frequencies are not contiguous , such as channel 6 to 7 skip from VHF low to high band , and channel 13 to 14 jump to UHF . On cable TV , it is possible to use adjacent channels only because they are all at the same power , something which could only be done terrestrially if the two stations were transmitted at the same power and height from the same location . For DTT , selectivity is inherently better , therefore channels adjacent ( either to analog or digital stations ) can be used even in the same area .",
  "/wiki/Radio": "Radio is the technology of signaling and communicating using radio waves . Radio waves are electromagnetic waves of frequency between 30 hertz ( Hz ) and 300 gigahertz ( GHz ) . They are generated by an electronic device called a transmitter connected to an antenna which radiates the waves , and received by a radio receiver connected to another antenna . Radio is very widely used in modern technology , in radio communication , radar , radio navigation , remote control , remote sensing and other applications . In radio communication , used in radio and television broadcasting , cell phones , two-way radios , wireless networking and satellite communication among numerous other uses , radio waves are used to carry information across space from a transmitter to a receiver , by modulating the radio signal ( impressing an information signal on the radio wave by varying some aspect of the wave ) in the transmitter . In radar , used to locate and track objects like aircraft , ships , spacecraft and missiles , a beam of radio waves emitted by a radar transmitter reflects off the target object , and the reflected waves reveal the object 's location . In radio navigation systems such as GPS and VOR , a mobile receiver receives radio signals from navigational radio beacons whose position is known , and by precisely measuring the arrival time of the radio waves the receiver can calculate its position on Earth . In wireless radio remote control devices like drones , garage door openers , and keyless entry systems , radio signals transmitted from a controller device control the actions of a remote device . Applications of radio waves which do not involve transmitting the waves significant distances , such as RF heating used in industrial processes and microwave ovens , and medical uses such as diathermy and MRI machines , are not usually called radio . The noun radio is also used to mean a broadcast radio receiver . Radio waves were first identified and studied by German physicist Heinrich Hertz in 1886 . The first practical radio transmitters and receivers were developed around 1895-6 by Italian Guglielmo Marconi , and radio began to be used commercially around 1900 .",
