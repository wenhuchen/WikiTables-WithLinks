  "/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild": "The Screen Actors Guild ( SAG ) was an American labor union which represented over 100,000 film and television principal and background performers worldwide . On March 30 , 2012 , the union leadership announced that the SAG membership voted to merge with the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists ( AFTRA ) to create SAG-AFTRA . According to SAG 's Mission Statement , the Guild sought to : negotiate and enforce collective bargaining agreements that establish equitable levels of compensation , benefits , and working conditions for its performers ; collect compensation for exploitation of recorded performances by its members , and provide protection against unauthorized use of those performances ; and preserve and expand work opportunities for its members . The Guild was founded in 1933 in an effort to eliminate what were described as exploitation of Hollywood actors who were being forced into oppressive multi-year contracts with the major movie studios . Opposition to these contracts included that they did not include restrictions on work hours or minimum rest periods , and often had clauses that automatically renewed at the studios ' discretion . These contracts were notorious for allowing the studios to dictate the public and private lives of the performers who signed them , and most did not have provisions to allow the performer to end the deal . [ citation needed ] The Screen Actors Guild was associated with the Associated Actors and Artistes of America ( AAAA ) , which is the primary association of performer 's unions in the United States . AAAA is affiliated with the AFL-CIO . SAG claimed exclusive jurisdiction over motion picture performances , and shared jurisdiction of radio , television , Internet , and other new media with its sister union AFTRA , with which it shared 44,000 dual members . Internationally , the SAG was affiliated with the International Federation of Actors .
