The kami are worshiped at kamidana household shrines , family shrines , and public shrines . The latter are staffed by priests who oversee offerings to the kami and the provision of religious paraphernalia such as amulets to the religion 's adherents . Other common rituals include the kagura ritual dances , age specific celebrations , and seasonal festivals . These festivals and rituals are collectively called matsuri . A major conceptual focus in Shinto is ensuring purity by cleansing practices of various types including ritual washing or bathing . Shinto does not emphasize specific moral codes other than ritual purity , reverence for kami , and regular communion following seasonal practices . Shinto has no single creator or specific doctrinal text , but exists in a diverse range of localized and regionalised forms ."
