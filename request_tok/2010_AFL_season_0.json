Rawlings completed year 12 ( final year of school ) whilst in his first year at the club ( 1999 ) . Rawlings made a name for himself becoming one of the league 's best taggers , but as his game grew in 2003 he started to win much more of his own ball , to hurt the opposition defensively and offensively . In 2004 , he had his best season to date , gaining selection for the International rules series and taking out the Syd Barker Medal for the North Melbourne best and fairest . In 2005 , Rawlings had another solid year , albeit not as good as the previous , but 2006 saw him recapture the career-best form to take out his second Syd Barker Medal . Rawlings was a solid contributor in 2007 and 2008 , but after some retirements , he was forced to be played in a variety of different roles . In 2009 , a rebuilding year for the club , he spent much time playing in defense shutting down some of the game 's most eluding players in Cyril Rioli and Aaron Davey . Rawlings played his 200th AFL game in North Melbourne 's five point win over St Kilda in round 21 . He continued in this defensive role in 2010 , but was also able to get the ball himself , having a career high 623 possessions and sharing his third Syd Barker Medal with Brent Harvey .",
