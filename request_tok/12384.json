  "/wiki/Clarence_Darrow_Octagon_House": "The Clarence Darrow Octagon House is a historic octagon house in the community of Kinsman , Ohio , United States . Home to lawyer Clarence Darrow in his childhood , it has been named a historic site . Born in the nearby community of Farmdale , Clarence Darrow was the son of a cabinetmaker . Together with his family , he moved to the octagon house in 1864 at the age of seven and lived in it until the family moved out of state circa 1873 . Darrow became a nationally prominent lawyer in his adulthood , and he remembered the octagon house as his home during his most significant childhood years , at a time when his interest in the law was leading him into activities such as running mock trials with his friends . Darrow 's final visit to the house occurred in 1936 , two years before his death . Constructed circa 1854 , the Darrow House is typical of octagon houses , a short-lived popular passion during the middle of the nineteenth century ; its leading proponent , Orson Squire Fowler , advocated their construction as a means of providing superior housing for the poor , and the design allowed for the interior space to be used more efficiently . The Darrow House is primarily a wooden building ; the walls are chestnut , with concrete used for chinking . There are seven rooms inside , and much of the original woodworking ( for example , the cupboards ) survives , as well as the original fireplaces and mantels . The first story of the house is surrounded by a prominent porch , which is absent from only one of the eight sides . Windows are centered in the sides on both stories , and a chimney protrudes from the center . In September 1971 , the Clarence Darrow Octagon House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places , just one week after the same distinction was awarded to Kinsman 's Congregational-Presbyterian Church and Dr. Peter Allen House .",
