Exceptionally , because of the state of emergency arising from the Second World War , the outgoing D\u00e1il was not dissolved until after the election , although it did not meet after 26 May . In April the government had proposed to postpone the election by introducing a bill to extend the maximum term of the D\u00e1il from five to six years ; however , in the absence of support from the Fine Gael opposition , the bill was withdrawn . The Emergency Powers Act 1939 was in force at the time of the election campaign , and concomitant press censorship affected coverage .",

Fine Gael is currently the governing and largest party in Ireland in terms of members of the Oireachtas and Irish members of the European Parliament . The party has a membership of 21,000 and is the senior partner governing in a minority coalition with several independent politicians , with party leader Leo Varadkar serving as Taoiseach . Varadkar succeeded Enda Kenny as party leader on 2 June 2017 and as Taoiseach on 14 June ; Kenny had been leader since 2002 , and Taoiseach since 2011 . Fine Gael was founded on 8 September 1933 following the merger of its parent party Cumann na nGaedheal , the National Centre Party and the National Guard . Its origins lie in the struggle for Irish independence and the pro-Treaty side in the Irish Civil War and Michael Collins , in particular , is often identified as the founder of the movement . Fine Gael is generally considered to be more of a proponent of market liberalism than its traditional rival , Fianna F\u00e1il . Apart from brief minority governments ( as in 1987 ) , Fine Gael has rarely governed Ireland without a coalition that also included the Labour Party , a social-democratic , centre-left party . Fine Gael describes itself as a party of the progressive centre which it defines as acting in a way that is right for Ireland , regardless of dogma or ideology . It lists its core values as equality of opportunity , free enterprise and reward , security , integrity and hope . It is strongly in favour of the European Union and opposed to physical force Irish republicanism . The party 's youth wing , Young Fine Gael , was formed in 1977 , and has approximately four thousand members .",

Since 1927 Fianna F\u00e1il has been one of Ireland 's two major parties , along with Fine Gael ; both are seen as being centre-right parties , and as being to the right of the Labour Party and Sinn F\u00e9in . The party dominated Irish political life for most of the 20th century , and since its foundation either it or Fine Gael has led every government . Between 1989 and 2011 , it led coalition governments with parties of both the left and the right . Fianna F\u00e1il was last in government from 1997 to 2011 under Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen , with a periodic high of 81 seats in 2002 , reduced to 77 in 2007 and then to 20 in 2011 ( during the post-2008 economic downturn ) , the lowest in the party 's history .

Following the funeral , Se\u00e1n MacBride , leader of Clann na Poblachta , asked O'Connor 's mother , Claire , to stand in the forthcoming by-election for her husband 's seat . When she refused , MacBride turned to O'Connor and pleaded with her to stand , saying that she was Clann na Poblachta 's only hope for survival , as the party 's fortunes had greatly soured after the first Inter-Party Government of 1951 .
