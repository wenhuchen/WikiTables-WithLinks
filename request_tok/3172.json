  "/wiki/Topaz_War_Relocation_Center": "The Topaz War Relocation Center , also known as the Central Utah Relocation Center ( Topaz ) and briefly as the Abraham Relocation Center , was an American concentration camp which housed Americans of Japanese descent and immigrants who had come to the United States from Japan , called Nikkei . President Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 in February 1942 , ordering people of Japanese ancestry to be incarcerated in what were euphemistically called , relocation centers like Topaz during World War II . Most of the people incarcerated at Topaz came from the Tanforan Assembly Center and previously lived in the San Francisco Bay Area . The camp was opened in September 1942 and closed in October 1945 . The camp , approximately 15 miles ( 24.1 km ) west of Delta , Utah , consisted of 19,800 acres ( 8,012.8 ha ) , with a 640 acres ( 259.0 ha ) main living area . Most internees lived in the main living area , though some lived off-site as agricultural and industrial laborers . The approximately 9,000 internees and staff made Topaz into the fifth-largest city in Utah at the time . The extreme temperature fluctuations of the arid area combined with uninsulated barracks made conditions very uncomfortable , even after the belated installation of pot-bellied stoves . The camp housed two elementary schools and a high school , a library , and some recreational facilities . Camp life was documented in a newspaper , Topaz Times , and in the literary publication Trek . Internees worked inside and outside the camp , mostly in agricultural labor . Many internees became notable artists .",
