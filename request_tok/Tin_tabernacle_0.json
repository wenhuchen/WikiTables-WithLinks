  "/wiki/Anglicanism": "Anglicanism is a Western Christian tradition which has developed from the practices , liturgy , and identity of the Church of England following the English Reformation . Adherents of Anglicanism are called Anglicans , or Episcopalians in some countries . The majority of Anglicans are members of national or regional ecclesiastical provinces of the international Anglican Communion , which forms the third-largest Christian communion in the world , after the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church . They are in full communion with the See of Canterbury , and thus the Archbishop of Canterbury , whom the communion refers to as its primus inter pares ( Latin , first among equals ) . He calls the decennial Lambeth Conference , chairs the meeting of primates , and is the president of the Anglican Consultative Council . Some churches that are not part of the Anglican Communion or recognised by the Anglican Communion also call themselves Anglican , including those that are part of the Continuing Anglican movement and Anglican realignment . Anglicans base their Christian faith on the Bible , traditions of the apostolic Church , apostolic succession ( historic episcopate ) , and the writings of the Church Fathers . Anglicanism forms one of the branches of Western Christianity , having definitively declared its independence from the Holy See at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement . Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Protestantism . These reforms in the Church of England were understood by one of those most responsible for them , Thomas Cranmer , the Archbishop of Canterbury , and others as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions , namely Lutheranism and Calvinism . In the first half of the 17th century , the Church of England and its associated Church of Ireland were presented by some Anglican divines as comprising a distinct Christian tradition , with theologies , structures , and forms of worship representing a different kind of middle way , or via media , between Protestantism and Catholicism - a perspective that came to be highly influential in later theories of Anglican identity and expressed in the description of Anglicanism as Catholic and Reformed . The degree of distinction between Protestant and Catholic tendencies within the Anglican tradition is routinely a matter of debate both within specific Anglican churches and throughout the Anglican Communion .",

  "/wiki/Baptists": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the 18th and 19th centuries , the First and Second Great Awakening increased church membership in the United States . Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent .",

It has not been in communion with any of the Oriental Orthodox churches since a 2015 decision to return to an independent status . The present British Orthodox Church derives from the consecration of a French former Dominican priest Jules Ferrette ( 1828-1904 ) , who in the year 1866 was consecrated as Bishop of Iona by the Syriac Orthodox Church 's Bishop of Emesa Boutros ibn Salmo Mesko ( 1799-1894 ) with the purpose of re-establishing Oriental Orthodoxy in the West . In February 1994 a delegation headed by Metropolitan Seraphim of Glastonbury , representing the Orthodox Church of the British Isles , was invited to Egypt by Pope Shenouda III , of the Coptic Orthodox Church . The Coptic Orthodox Pope & Patriarch of Alexandria , Pope Shenouda III met the delegation and discussed their dogma ( they being of Orthodox origin ) , and the matter of their uniting with the Coptic Church . On 19 March 1994 , at the Synod of Soho which met at the House of St Barnabas-in-Soho , the clergy unanimously supported proceeding towards full union with the Alexandrian patriarchate . In further detailed discussions with Pope Shenouda and senior members of the Holy Synod , held in Cairo in April , May and June in Cairo again on 2-11 April and 28 May-5 June , details of the protocol determining the relationship of the Orthodox Church of the British Isles to the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria were agreed . Pope Shenouda decided not to re-ordain Abba Seraphim but to recognise his orders and received him by economia on 4 June 1994 . Although his episcopal orders were fully recognised , Pope Shenouda decided to ordain him as a bishop in order to bring all the clergy within the Coptic line of apostolic succession . He had been enthroned as Metropolitan of Glastonbury following the death of his predecessor in 1979 , but now he would also be ordained as a metropolitan of the patriarchate . In the Coptic Orthodox tradition , metropolitans are actually ordained , as the senior episcopal rank .

  "/wiki/Methodist_Church_of_Great_Britain": "The Methodist Church of Great Britain is a Protestant Christian denomination in Britain and the mother church to Methodists worldwide . It participates in the World Methodist Council , the World Council of Churches and other ecumenical associations . Methodism began primarily through the work of John Wesley ( 1703-1791 ) , who led an evangelical revival in 18th-century Britain . An Anglican priest , Wesley adopted unconventional and controversial practices , such as open-air preaching , to reach factory labourers and newly urbanised masses uprooted from their traditional village culture at the start of the Industrial Revolution . His preaching centred upon the universality of God 's grace for all , the effect of faith on character and the possibility of perfection in love during this life . He organised the new converts locally and in a Connexion across Britain . Following Wesley 's death , the Methodist revival became a separate church and ordained its own ministers ; it is called a nonconformist church because it does not conform to the rules of the established Church of England . In the 19th century , the Wesleyan Methodist Church experienced many secessions , with the largest of the offshoots being the Primitive Methodists . The main streams of Methodism were reunited in 1932 , forming the Methodist Church as it is today . Methodist circuits , containing several local churches , are gathered into thirty districts . The supreme governing body of the church is the annual Methodist Conference ; it is headed by the president of Conference , a presbyteral minister , supported by a vice-president who can be a local preacher or deacon .

It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy .

Evangelicals believe in the centrality of the conversion or born again experience in receiving salvation , in the authority of the Bible as God 's revelation to humanity , and in spreading the Christian message . The movement has long had a presence in the Anglosphere before spreading further afield in the 19th , 20th and early 21st centuries . Its origins are usually traced to 1738 , with various theological streams contributing to its foundation , including English Methodism , the Moravian Church ( in particular its bishop Nicolaus Zinzendorf and his community at Herrnhut ) , and German Lutheran Pietism . Preeminently , John Wesley and other early Methodists were at the root of sparking this new movement during the First Great Awakening . Today , evangelicals are found across many Protestant branches , as well as in various denominations not subsumed to a specific branch . Among leaders and major figures of the evangelical Protestant movement were John Wesley , George Whitefield , Jonathan Edwards , Billy Graham , Bill Bright , Harold Ockenga , John Stott and Martyn Lloyd-Jones . The movement gained great momentum during the 18th and 19th centuries with the Great Awakenings in Great Britain and the United States .

The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early , High , and Late Middle Ages . Population decline , counterurbanisation , collapse of centralized authority , invasions , and mass migrations of tribes , which had begun in Late Antiquity , continued in the Early Middle Ages . The large-scale movements of the Migration Period , including various Germanic peoples , formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire . In the 7th century , North Africa and the Middle East - once part of the Byzantine Empire - came under the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate , an Islamic empire , after conquest by Muhammad 's successors . Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures , the break with classical antiquity was not complete . The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire , Rome 's direct continuation , survived in the Eastern Mediterranean and remained a major power . The empire 's law code , the Corpus Juris Civilis or Code of Justinian , was rediscovered in Northern Italy in 1070 and became widely admired later in the Middle Ages .
