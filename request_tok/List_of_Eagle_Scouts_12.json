  "/wiki/Battle_of_Ia_Drang": "The Battle of Ia Drang was the first major battle between the United States Army and the People 's Army of Vietnam ( PAVN ) , also referred to as the North Vietnamese Army ( NVA ) , and was part of the Pleiku Campaign conducted early in the Vietnam War . It comprised two main engagements , centered on two previously scouted helicopter landing zones ( LZs ) , known as LZ X-Ray and LZ Albany . The first involved the 1st Battalion , 7th Cavalry Regiment and supporting units under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore , and took place November 14-16 , 1965 at LZ X-Ray , located at the eastern foot of the Chu Pong Massif in the central highlands of Vietnam . The second engagement involved the 2nd Battalion , 7th Cavalry Regiment plus supporting units under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Robert McDade , and took place on November 17 at LZ Albany , farther north in the Ia Drang Valley . It is notable for being the first large scale helicopter air assault and also the first use of Boeing B-52 Stratofortress strategic bombers in a tactical support role . Surrounded and under heavy fire from a numerically superior force , the American forces at LZ X-ray were able to hold off and drive back the North Vietnamese forces over three days of battle , largely through the support of both air power and heavy artillery bombardment , which the North Vietnamese lacked . LZ X-ray was considered an American tactical victory , as the Americans were able to exact an almost 10:1 kill ratio . At LZ Albany , the American forces were ambushed in close quarters . They were unable to use air and artillery support due to the close engagement of the North Vietnamese , the American forces were badly defeated , suffering an over-50% casualty rate before being extricated from the battle . Both sides , therefore , were able to claim victory in the battle . The size of the clearing at LZ X-Ray meant that troops had to be shuttled in , the first lift landing at 10:48 . The last troops of the battalion were landed at 15:20 , by which time the troops on the ground were already heavily engaged , with one platoon cut off .",

Immediately after the disaster , NASA convened the Columbia Accident Investigation Board to determine the cause of the disintegration . The source of the failure was determined to have been caused by a piece of foam that broke off during launch and damaged the thermal protection system ( reinforced carbon-carbon panels and thermal protection tiles ) on the leading edge of the orbiter 's left wing . During re-entry the damaged wing slowly overheated and came apart , eventually leading to loss of control and disintegration of the vehicle . The cockpit window frame is now exhibited in a memorial inside the Space Shuttle Atlantis Pavilion at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida . The damage to the thermal protection system on the wing was similar to that Atlantis had sustained back in 1988 during STS-27 , the second mission after the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster . However , the damage on STS-27 occurred at a spot that had more robust metal , and that mission survived the re-entry .",

  "/wiki/Knights_of_St._John": "The Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem ( Latin : Ordo Fratrum Hospitalis Sancti Ioannis Hierosolymitani ) , commonly known as the Knights Hospitaller or the Order of Saint John , was a medieval and early modern Catholic military order . It was headquartered in the Kingdom of Jerusalem until 1291 , on the island of Rhodes from 1310 until 1522 , in Malta from 1530 until 1798 and at Saint Petersburg from 1799 until 1801 . Today several organizations continue the Hospitaller tradition , most importantly the Sovereign Military Order of Malta . The Hospitallers arose in the early 11th century , during the time of the Cluniac ( or Benedictine ) Reform , as a group of individuals associated with an Amalfitan hospital in the Muristan district of Jerusalem , dedicated to John the Baptist and founded around 1099 by Gerard Thom to provide care for sick , poor or injured pilgrims coming to the Holy Land . Some scholars , however , consider that the Amalfitan order and hospital were different from Gerard Thom 's order and its hospital . After the conquest of Jerusalem in 1099 during the First Crusade , the organisation became a military religious order under its own papal charter , charged with the care and defence of the Holy Land . Following the conquest of the Holy Land by Islamic forces , the knights operated from Rhodes , over which they were sovereign , and later from Malta , where they administered a vassal state under the Spanish viceroy of Sicily . The Hospitallers were one of the smallest groups to briefly colonise parts of the Americas : they acquired four Caribbean islands in the mid-17th century , which they turned over to France in the 1660s . The knights became divided during the Protestant Reformation , when rich commanderies of the order in northern Germany and the Netherlands became Protestant and largely separated from the Roman Catholic main stem , remaining separate to this day , although ecumenical relations between the descendant chivalric orders are amicable . The order was suppressed in England , Denmark , as well as in some other parts of northern Europe , and it was further damaged by Napoleon 's capture of Malta in 1798 , following which it became dispersed throughout Europe ."
