  "/wiki/Ribonucleic_acid": "Ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding , decoding , regulation and expression of genes . RNA and DNA are nucleic acids , and , along with lipids , proteins and carbohydrates , constitute the four major macromolecules essential for all known forms of life . Like DNA , RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides , but unlike DNA , RNA is found in nature as a single strand folded onto itself , rather than a paired double strand . Cellular organisms use messenger RNA ( mRNA ) to convey genetic information ( using the nitrogenous bases of guanine , uracil , adenine , and cytosine , denoted by the letters G , U , A , and C ) that directs synthesis of specific proteins . Many viruses encode their genetic information using an RNA genome . Some RNA molecules play an active role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions , controlling gene expression , or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals . One of these active processes is protein synthesis , a universal function in which RNA molecules direct the synthesis of proteins on ribosomes . This process uses transfer RNA ( tRNA ) molecules to deliver amino acids to the ribosome , where ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) then links amino acids together to form coded proteins .",

DNA and ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) are nucleic acids ; alongside proteins , lipids and complex carbohydrates ( polysaccharides ) , nucleic acids are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life . The two DNA strands are also known as polynucleotides as they are composed of simpler monomeric units called nucleotides . Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases ( cytosine [ C ] , guanine [ G ] , adenine [ A ] or thymine [ T ] ) , a sugar called deoxyribose , and a phosphate group . The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next , resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone . The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together , according to base pairing rules ( A with T and C with G ) , with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA . The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups , pyrimidines and purines . In DNA , the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine ; the purines are adenine and guanine . Both strands of double-stranded DNA store the same biological information . This information is replicated as and when the two strands separate . A large part of DNA ( more than 98% for humans ) is non-coding , meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences . The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are thus antiparallel .",

  "/wiki/Peptide_hormone": "Peptide hormones or protein hormones are hormones whose molecules are peptides or proteins , respectively . The latter have longer amino acid chain lengths than the former . These hormones have an effect on the endocrine system of animals , including humans . Most hormones can be classified as either amino acid-based hormones ( amine , peptide , or protein ) or steroid hormones . The former are water-soluble and act on the surface of target cells via second messengers ; the latter , being lipid-soluble , move through the plasma membranes of target cells ( both cytoplasmic and nuclear ) to act within their nuclei . Like all peptides and proteins , peptide hormones and protein hormones are synthesized in cells from amino acids according to mRNA transcripts , which are synthesized from DNA templates inside the cell nucleus . Preprohormones , peptide hormone precursors , are then processed in several stages , typically in the endoplasmic reticulum , including removal of the N-terminal signal sequence and sometimes glycosylation , resulting in prohormones . The prohormones are then packaged into membrane-bound secretory vesicles , which can be secreted from the cell by exocytosis in response to specific stimuli ( e.g . -- an increase in Ca2+ and cAMP concentration in cytoplasm ) . These prohormones often contain superfluous amino acid residues that were needed to direct folding of the hormone molecule into its active configuration but have no function once the hormone folds . Specific endopeptidases in the cell cleave the prohormone just before it is released into the bloodstream , generating the mature hormone form of the molecule . Mature peptide hormones then travel through the blood to all of the cells of the body , where they interact with specific receptor on the surfaces of their target cells .",

While working on a new type of antenna at Bell Labs in Holmdel Township , New Jersey , they found a source of noise in the atmosphere that they could not explain .

  "/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation": "The cosmic microwave background ( CMB , CMBR ) , in Big Bang cosmology , is electromagnetic radiation as a remnant from an early stage of the universe , also known as relic radiation . The CMB is faint cosmic background radiation filling all space . It is an important source of data on the early universe because it is the oldest electromagnetic radiation in the universe , dating to the epoch of recombination . With a traditional optical telescope , the space between stars and galaxies ( the background ) is completely dark . However , a sufficiently sensitive radio telescope shows a faint background noise , or glow , almost isotropic , that is not associated with any star , galaxy , or other object . This glow is strongest in the microwave region of the radio spectrum . The accidental discovery of the CMB in 1964 by American radio astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson was the culmination of work initiated in the 1940s , and earned the discoverers the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics . CMB is landmark evidence of the Big Bang origin of the universe . When the universe was young , before the formation of stars and planets , it was denser , much hotter , and filled with a uniform glow from a white-hot fog of hydrogen plasma . As the universe expanded , both the plasma and the radiation filling it grew cooler . When the universe cooled enough , protons and electrons combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms . Unlike the uncombined protons and electrons , these newly conceived atoms could not scatter the thermal radiation by Thomson scattering , and so the universe became transparent instead of being an opaque fog .",

In July 2012 , the United Nations recognised the importance of the science of crystallography by proclaiming that 2014 would be the International Year of Crystallography . Before the development of X-ray diffraction crystallography ( see below ) , the study of crystals was based on physical measurements of their geometry using a goniometer . This involved measuring the angles of crystal faces relative to each other and to theoretical reference axes ( crystallographic axes ) , and establishing the symmetry of the crystal in question . The position in 3D space of each crystal face is plotted on a stereographic net such as a Wulff net or Lambert net . The pole to each face is plotted on the net . Each point is labelled with its Miller index . The final plot allows the symmetry of the crystal to be established . Crystallographic methods now depend on analysis of the diffraction patterns of a sample targeted by a beam of some type . X-rays are most commonly used ; other beams used include electrons or neutrons . Crystallographers often explicitly state the type of beam used , as in the terms X-ray crystallography , neutron diffraction and electron diffraction .",

  "/wiki/Pharmacology": "Pharmacology is the branch of pharmaceutical sciences which is concerned with the study of drug or medication action , where a drug can be broadly or narrowly defined as any man-made , natural , or endogenous ( from within the body ) molecule which exerts a biochemical or physiological effect on the cell , tissue , organ , or organism ( sometimes the word pharmacon is used as a term to encompass these endogenous and exogenous bioactive species ) . More specifically , it is the study of the interactions that occur between a living organism and chemicals that affect normal or abnormal biochemical function . If substances have medicinal properties , they are considered pharmaceuticals . The field encompasses drug composition and properties , synthesis and drug design , molecular and cellular mechanisms , organ/systems mechanisms , signal transduction/cellular communication , molecular diagnostics , interactions , chemical biology , therapy , and medical applications and antipathogenic capabilities . The two main areas of pharmacology are pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics . Pharmacodynamics studies the effects of a drug on biological systems , and pharmacokinetics studies the effects of biological systems on a drug . In broad terms , pharmacodynamics discusses the chemicals with biological receptors , and pharmacokinetics discusses the absorption , distribution , metabolism , and excretion ( ADME ) of chemicals from the biological systems . Pharmacology is not synonymous with pharmacy and the two terms are frequently confused . Pharmacology , a biomedical science , deals with the research , discovery , and characterization of chemicals which show biological effects and the elucidation of cellular and organismal function in relation to these chemicals . In contrast , pharmacy , a health services profession , is concerned with the application of the principles learned from pharmacology in its clinical settings ; whether it be in a dispensing or clinical care role .

  "/wiki/Neutrino": "A neutrino ( /nu\u02d0\u02c8tri\u02d0no\u028a/ or /nju\u02d0\u02c8tri\u02d0no\u028a/ ) ( denoted by the Greek letter \u03bd ) is a fermion ( an elementary particle with spin of 1/2 ) that interacts only via the weak subatomic force and gravity . The neutrino is so named because it is electrically neutral and because its rest mass is so small ( -ino ) that it was long thought to be zero . The mass of the neutrino is much smaller than that of the other known elementary particles . The weak force has a very short range , the gravitational interaction is extremely weak , and neutrinos do not participate in the strong interaction . Thus , neutrinos typically pass through normal matter unimpeded and undetected . Weak interactions create neutrinos in one of three leptonic flavors : electron neutrinos ( \u03bde ) , muon neutrinos ( \u03bd\u03bc ) , or tau neutrinos ( \u03bd\u03c4 ) , in association with the corresponding charged lepton . Although neutrinos were long believed to be massless , it is now known that there are three discrete neutrino masses with different tiny values , but they do not correspond uniquely to the three flavors . A neutrino created with a specific flavor has an associated specific quantum superposition of all three mass states . As a result , neutrinos oscillate between different flavors in flight . For example , an electron neutrino produced in a beta decay reaction may interact in a distant detector as a muon or tau neutrino . Although only differences between squares of the three mass values are known as of 2019 , cosmological observations imply that the sum of the three masses must be less than one millionth that of the electron . For each neutrino , there also exists a corresponding antiparticle , called an antineutrino , which also has spin of 1/2 and no electric charge .",
  "/wiki/Lepton": "In particle physics , a lepton is an elementary particle of half-integer spin ( spin \u200b1\u20442 ) that does not undergo strong interactions . Two main classes of leptons exist , charged leptons ( also known as the electron-like leptons ) , and neutral leptons ( better known as neutrinos ) . Charged leptons can combine with other particles to form various composite particles such as atoms and positronium , while neutrinos rarely interact with anything , and are consequently rarely observed . The best known of all leptons is the electron . There are six types of leptons , known as flavours , grouped in three generations . The first-generation leptons , also called electronic leptons , comprise the electron ( e\u2212 ) and the electron neutrino ( \u03bde ) ; the second are the muonic leptons , comprising the muon ( \u03bc\u2212 ) and the muon neutrino ( \u03bd\u03bc ) ; and the third are the tauonic leptons , comprising the tau ( \u03c4\u2212 ) and the tau neutrino ( \u03bd\u03c4 ) . Electrons have the least mass of all the charged leptons . The heavier muons and taus will rapidly change into electrons and neutrinos through a process of particle decay : the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state . Thus electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the universe , whereas muons and taus can only be produced in high energy collisions ( such as those involving cosmic rays and those carried out in particle accelerators ) . Leptons have various intrinsic properties , including electric charge , spin , and mass . Unlike quarks , however , leptons are not subject to the strong interaction , but they are subject to the other three fundamental interactions : gravitation , the weak interaction , and to electromagnetism , of which the latter is proportional to charge , and is thus zero for the electrically neutral neutrinos . For every lepton flavor , there is a corresponding type of antiparticle , known as an antilepton , that differs from the lepton only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign .",

  "/wiki/Game_theory": "Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers . It has applications in all fields of social science , as well as in logic , systems science and computer science . Originally , it addressed zero-sum games , in which each participant 's gains or losses are exactly balanced by those of the other participants . Today , game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations , and is now an umbrella term for the science of logical decision making in humans , animals , and computers . Modern game theory began with the idea of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person zero-sum games and its proof by John von Neumann . Von Neumann 's original proof used the Brouwer fixed-point theorem on continuous mappings into compact convex sets , which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics . His paper was followed by the 1944 book Theory of Games and Economic Behavior , co-written with Oskar Morgenstern , which considered cooperative games of several players . The second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory of expected utility , which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision-making under uncertainty . Game theory was developed extensively in the 1950s by many scholars . It was explicitly applied to biology in the 1970s , although similar developments go back at least as far as the 1930s . Game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many fields . As of 2014 [ update ] , with the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences going to game theorist Jean Tirole , eleven game theorists have won the economics Nobel Prize .",
