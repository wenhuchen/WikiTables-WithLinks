  "/wiki/Ashley_River_(South_Carolina)": "The Ashley River is a blackwater / tidal river in South Carolina , rising from the Wassamassaw and Great Cypress Swamps in western Berkeley County . It consolidates its main channel about five miles west of Summerville , widening into a tidal estuary just south of Fort Dorchester . The river then flows for approximately 17 miles along the historical banks of the City of North Charleston before reaching peninsular Charleston . The much wider Ashley joins the Cooper River off the Battery in Charleston to form Charleston Harbor before discharging into the Atlantic Ocean . As of 2012 [ update ] the land around the Ashley River ( or in Ashley Barony , as the original land grant was called ) is mostly undeveloped . The river was named for Anthony Ashley Cooper , 1st Earl of Shaftesbury and chief Lord Proprietor of the Carolina Colony by explorer Robert Sandford . In 1675 Cooper was granted 12,000 acres of land along the river after a permanent settlement was made at Albemarle Point in 1670 . This settlement was the first permanent European settlement in South Carolina and today Albemarle Point is known as Charles Towne Landing . The settlement would be moved to its current peninsular location across the river ten years later and is well known as Charleston . The land closest to the river was developed by plantation owners throughout the eighteenth century . During the Revolutionary War the British occupied the plantations from 1780 to 1782 . The major crops grown along the Ashley River included rice , indigo , and cotton .",

  "/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina": "Charleston is the oldest and largest city in the U.S. state of South Carolina .

Charleston was founded in 1670 as Charles Town , honoring King Charles II of England . Its initial location at Albemarle Point on the west bank of the Ashley River ( now Charles Towne Landing ) was abandoned in 1680 for its present site , which became the fifth-largest city in North America within ten years . One of the key cities in the British colonization of the Americas , Charles Town played a major role in the slave trade , which laid the foundation for the city 's size and wealth , and was dominated by a slavocracy of plantation owners and slave traders . Independent Charleston slave traders like Joseph Wragg were the first to break through the monopoly of the Royal African Company , pioneering the large-scale slave trade of the 18th century . Historians estimate that nearly half of all Africans brought to America arrived in Charleston , most at Gadsden 's Wharf . Despite its size , it remained unincorporated throughout the colonial period ; its government was handled directly by a colonial legislature and a governor sent by London , England .

  "/wiki/Middleton_Place": "Middleton Place is a plantation in Dorchester County , directly across the Ashley River from North Charleston and about 15 miles ( 24 km ) northwest of Charleston , in the U.S. state of South Carolina . Built in several phases during the 18th and 19th centuries , the plantation was the primary residence of several generations of the Middleton family , many of whom played prominent roles in the colonial and antebellum history of South Carolina . The plantation , now a National Historic Landmark District , is used as a museum , and is home to the oldest landscaped gardens in the United States . John Williams , an early South Carolina planter , probably began building Middleton Place in the late 1730s . His son-in-law Henry Middleton ( 1717-1784 ) , who later served as President of the First Continental Congress , completed the house 's main section and its north and south flankers , and began work on the elaborate gardens . Middleton 's son , Arthur Middleton ( 1742-1787 ) , a signer of Declaration of Independence , was born at Middleton Place , and lived at the plantation in the last years of his life . Arthur Middleton 's son and grandson , Henry Middleton ( 1770-1846 ) and Williams Middleton ( 1809-1883 ) , oversaw Middleton Place 's transition from a country residence to a more active rice plantation . In 1865 , toward the end of the U.S. Civil War , Union soldiers burned most of the house , leaving only the south wing and gutted walls of the north wing and main house . An earthquake in 1886 toppled the walls of the main house and north wing . The restoration of Middleton Place began in 1916 when Middleton descendant John Julius Pringle Smith ( 1887-1969 ) and his wife Heningham began several decades of meticulously rebuilding the plantation 's gardens . They had New York architect Bancel LaFarge design a stableyard complex of barn , stable , work buildings , and cottages ; the buildings were constructed of brick salvaged from the ruined main house . In the early 1970s , approximately 110 acres ( 45 ha ) of the 7,000-acre ( 2,800 ha ) plantation - including the south flanker , the gardens , and several outbuildings - were placed on the National Register of Historic Places .",
