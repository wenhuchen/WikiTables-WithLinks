  "/wiki/Civil_parishes_in_England": "In England , a civil parish is a type of administrative parish used for local government . It is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties , or their combined form , the unitary authority . Civil parishes can trace their origin to the ancient system of ecclesiastical parishes which historically played a role in both civil and ecclesiastical administration ; civil and religious parishes were formally split into two types in the 19th century and are now entirely separate . The unit was devised and rolled out across England in the 1860s . A civil parish can range in size from a large town with a population of up to 95,000 to a single village with fewer than a hundred inhabitants . Eight parishes also have city status ( a status granted by the monarch ) . A civil parish may be equally known as and confirmed as a town , village , neighbourhood or community by resolution of its parish council , a right reserved not conferred on other units of English local government . Approximately 35% of the English population live in a civil parish . As of 31 December 2015 there were 10,449 parishes in England . The most populous is Sutton Coldfield , and those with cathedral city status are Chichester , Ely , Hereford , Lichfield , Ripon , Salisbury , Truro and Wells . On 1 April 2014 , Queen 's Park became the first civil parish in Greater London . Before 2008 their creation was not permitted within a London borough .",
