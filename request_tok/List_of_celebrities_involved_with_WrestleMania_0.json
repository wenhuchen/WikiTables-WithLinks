Reubens joined the Los Angeles troupe The Groundlings in the 1970s , and started his career as an improvisational comedian and stage actor . In 1982 , Reubens began appearing in a show about a character he had been developing for years . The show called The Pee-wee Herman Show , ran for five sold-out months , and HBO produced a successful special about it . Pee-wee became an instant cult figure and , for the next decade , Reubens was completely committed to his character , doing all of his public appearances and interviews as Pee-wee . His feature film , Pee-wee 's Big Adventure ( 1985 ) , directed by the then-unknown Tim Burton , was a financial and critical success , and soon developed into a cult film . Its sequel , Big Top Pee-wee ( 1988 ) , was less successful . Between 1986 and 1990 , Reubens starred as Pee-wee in the CBS Saturday-morning children 's program Pee-wee 's Playhouse . Thereafter , Reubens decided to take a sabbatical from Pee-wee . In July 1991 , Reubens was arrested for indecent exposure in an adult theater in Sarasota , Florida . The arrest set off a chain reaction of national media attention that changed the general public 's view of Reubens and Pee-wee . The arrest postponed Reubens ' involvement in major projects until 1999 , when he appeared in several big-budget projects including Mystery Men and Blow , and Reubens started giving interviews as himself rather than as Pee-wee .",

Due to negative media attention following a scandal in 1991 , Reubens decided to shelve his alter ego during the 1990s , then gradually resurrected it during the following decade . It was at that time that Reubens addressed plans to write a new Pee-wee film , Pee-wee 's Playhouse : The Movie .

  "/wiki/Ring_announcer": "A ring announcer is an in-ring ( and sometimes on-camera ) employee or contractor for a boxing , professional wrestling or mixed martial arts event or promotion , who introduces the competitors to the audience . In boxing and mixed martial arts bouts , introductions occur after both fighters have entered the ring or cage . Along with each fighter 's name , the announcer typically also announces their height , weight , town , nickname , win/loss record and any current or past titles the fighter has won . In MMA , the fighting discipline is usually announced . In professional wrestling , wrestlers are similarly introduced , though usually before or as they come to the ring . In-ring introductions are sometimes used for title matches or other major bouts , to add a big fight feel . The ring announcer often states the rules of the match . In boxing and MMA , this is usually limited to the number of scheduled rounds and the length of each round . In professional wrestling , the variations are much more numerous and so the announcer may have to explain significantly more to the audience . When an MMA or boxing bout concludes , the ring announcer announces the winner , time of finish and method . If the fight lasts all scheduled rounds , the announcer will read the fight judges ' scorecard totals , before announcing a unanimous , majority , or split decision victory for one of the fighters , or a draw .
