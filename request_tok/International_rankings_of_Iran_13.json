  "/wiki/Bribery": "Bribery is defined by Black 's Law Dictionary as the offering , giving , receiving , or soliciting of any item of value to influence the actions of an official , or other person , in charge of a public or legal duty .

However , giving a discount specifically to that employee to influence them to look favorably on the electric utility 's rate increase applications would be considered bribery . A bribe is an illegal or unethical gift bestowed to influence the recipient 's conduct . It may be money , goods , rights in action , property , preferment , privilege , emolument , objects of value , advantage , or merely a promise to induce or influence the action , vote , or influence of a person in an official or public capacity .",

Geography is a very significant factor in informing Iran 's foreign policy . Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution , the newly born Islamic Republic , under the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini , dramatically reversed the pro-American foreign policy of the last Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi . Since then the country 's policies have oscillated between the two opposing tendencies of revolutionary ardour , which would eliminate Western and non-Muslim influences while promoting the Islamic revolution abroad , and pragmatism , which would advance economic development and normalization of relations . Iran 's bilateral dealings are accordingly sometimes confused and contradictory . Iran currently maintains full diplomatic relations with 97 countries worldwide . According to data published by the Reputation Institute , Iran is the world 's second most hated country , just ahead of Iraq , and has held that position for the three consecutive years of 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Islamism and nuclear proliferation are recurring issues with Iran 's foreign relations . In a series of international polls by Pew Research in 2012 , only one country ( Pakistan ) had the majority of its population supporting Iran 's right to acquire nuclear arms ; every other population polled overwhelmingly rejected a nuclear-armed Iran ( 90-95% opposed in the polled European , North American , and South American countries ) , and majorities in most of them were in favor of military action to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran from materializing .
