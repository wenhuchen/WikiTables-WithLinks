  "/wiki/Shearwater": "Shearwaters are medium-sized long-winged seabirds . There are more than 30 species of shearwaters , a few larger ones in the genus Calonectris and many smaller species in the genus Puffinus . The Procellaria petrels and Bulweria were believed to belong to this group , but are only distantly related based on more recent studies , while the Pseudobulweria and Lugensa petrels are more closely related . The genus Puffinus can be divided into a group of small species close to Calonectris and a few larger ones more distantly related to both . These birds are most common in temperate and cold waters . They are pelagic outside the breeding season . These tubenose birds fly with stiff wings and use a shearing flight technique ( flying very close to the water and seemingly cutting or shearing the tips of waves ) to move across wave fronts with the minimum of active flight . This technique gives the group its English name . Some small species , like the Manx shearwater are cruciform in flight , with their long wings held directly out from their bodies . Many are long-distance migrants , perhaps most spectacularly sooty shearwaters , which cover distances in excess of 14,000 km ( 8,700 mi ) from their breeding colony on the Falkland Islands ( 52\u00b0S 60\u00b0W ) to as far as 70\u00b0 north latitude in the North Atlantic Ocean off northern Norway . One study found Sooty shearwaters migrating nearly 40,000 miles ( 64,000 kilometers ) a year , which would give them the longest animal migration ever recorded electronically . Short-tailed shearwaters perform an even longer figure of eight loop migration in the Pacific Ocean from Tasmania to as far north as the Arctic Ocean off northwest Alaska .",
