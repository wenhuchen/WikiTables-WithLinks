  "/wiki/Mixed_martial_artist": "Mixed martial arts ( MMA ) , also known as cage fighting , is a full-contact combat sport that allows striking and grappling , both standing and on the ground , using techniques from various combat sports and martial arts . The first documented use of the term mixed martial arts was in a review of UFC 1 by television critic Howard Rosenberg in 1993 . The term gained popularity when newfullcontact.com , then one of the largest websites covering the sport , hosted and republished the article . The question of who actually coined the term is subject to debate . During the early 20th century , various interstylistic contests took place throughout Japan and in the countries of the Four Asian Tigers . In Brazil , there was the sport of Vale Tudo , in which fighters from various styles fought with little to no rules . The Gracie family was known to promote Vale Tudo matches as a way to promote their own Brazilian jiu-jitsu style . An early high-profile mixed martial arts bout was fought in 1951 , between the judoka Masahiko Kimura and Brazilian jiu-jitsu founder H\u00e9lio Gracie in Brazil . In the West , the concept of combining elements of multiple martial arts was popularized by Bruce Lee 's Jeet Kune Do during the late 1960s to early 1970s . A precursor to modern MMA was the 1976 Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki bout , fought between boxer Muhammad Ali and wrestler Antonio Inoki in Japan , where it later inspired the foundation of Pancrase in 1993 and Pride Fighting Championships in 1997 . In 1980 , CV Productions , Inc. created the first regulated MMA league in the United States , called Tough Guy Contest , which was later renamed Battle of the Superfighters . The company sanctioned ten tournaments in Pennsylvania .",

The organization is headquartered in Indianapolis , Indiana . In its 2016-17 fiscal year the NCAA took in $ 1.06 billion in revenue , over 82% of which was generated by the Division I Men 's Basketball Tournament . In August 1973 , the current three-division system of Division I , Division II , and Division III was adopted by the NCAA membership in a special convention . Under NCAA rules , Division I and Division II schools can offer scholarships to athletes for playing a sport . Division III schools may not offer any athletic scholarships . Generally , larger schools compete in Division I and smaller schools in II and III . Division I football was further divided into I-A and I-AA in 1978 . Subsequently , the term Division I-AAA was briefly added to delineate Division I schools which do not field a football program at all , but that term is no longer officially used by the NCAA . In 2006 , Divisions I-A and I-AA were respectively renamed the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) and Football Championship Subdivision ( FCS ) . Controversially , the NCAA severely caps the benefits that collegiate athletes can receive from their schools .",
  "/wiki/Goodwill_Games": "The Goodwill Games was an international sports competition created by Ted Turner in reaction to the political troubles surrounding the Olympic Games of the 1980s .

Like the Olympics , the Goodwill Games were held every four years ( with the exception of the final Games ) , and had a summer and winter component . The Summer Goodwill Games occurred five times , between 1986 and 2001 , while the Winter Goodwill Games occurred only once , in 2000 . They were cancelled by Time Warner , which had bought ownership of them in 1996 , due to low television ratings after the 2001 games in Brisbane .",
  "/wiki/Gold_medal": "A gold medal is a medal awarded for highest achievement in a non-military field .

Others offer only the prestige of the award . Many organizations now award gold medals either annually or extraordinarily , including UNESCO and various academic societies . While some gold medals are solid gold , others are gold-plated or silver-gilt , like those of the Olympic Games , the Lorentz Medal , the United States Congressional Gold Medal and the Nobel Prize medal . Nobel Prize medals consist of 18 karat green gold plated with 24 karat gold . Before 1980 they were struck in 23 karat gold .",
  "/wiki/Freestyle_wrestling": "Freestyle wrestling is a style of amateur wrestling that is practiced throughout the world . Along with Greco-Roman , it is one of the two styles of wrestling contested in the Olympic games . American high school and college wrestling is conducted under different rules and is termed scholastic and collegiate wrestling . Freestyle wrestling , like collegiate wrestling , has its greatest origins in catch-as-catch-can wrestling . In both styles the ultimate goal is to throw and pin the opponent to the mat , which results in an immediate win . Unlike Greco-Roman , freestyle and collegiate wrestling allow the use of the wrestler 's or the opponent 's legs in offense and defense . Freestyle wrestling brings together traditional wrestling , judo , and sambo techniques . According to wrestling 's world governing body , United World Wrestling ( UWW ) , freestyle wrestling is one of the six main forms of amateur competitive wrestling practiced internationally today . The other five forms are Greco-Roman wrestling , grappling/submission wrestling , beach wrestling , pankration athlima , alysh/belt wrestling and traditional/folk wrestling .

These Games , which were the fourth Summer Olympics to be hosted by the United States , marked the centennial of the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens - the inaugural edition of the modern Olympic Games . They were also the first since 1924 to be held in a different year from a Winter Olympics , under a new IOC practice implemented in 1994 to hold the Summer and Winter Games in alternating , even-numbered years . More than 10,000 athletes from 197 National Olympic Committees competed in 26 sports , including the Olympic debuts of beach volleyball , mountain biking , and softball , as well as the new disciplines of lightweight rowing and women 's football ( soccer ) . 24 countries made their Summer Olympic debut in Atlanta , including eleven former Soviet republics participating for the first time as independent nations . The hosting United States led the medal count with a total of 101 medals , and the most gold ( 44 ) and silver ( 32 ) medals out of all countries . The U.S. topped the medal count for the first time since 1984 , and for the first time since 1968 in a non-boycotted Summer Olympics . Notable performances during competition included those of Andre Agassi - who became the first men 's singles tennis player to combine a career Grand Slam with an Olympic gold medal , Donovan Bailey - who set a new world record of 9.84 for the men 's 100 meters , and Lilia Podkopayeva - who became the second gymnast to win an individual event gold after winning the all-round title in the same Olympics . The festivities were marred by violence on July 27 , when Eric Rudolph detonated pipe bombs at Centennial Olympic Park - a downtown park that was built to serve as a public focal point for the Games ' festivities , killing 1 and injuring 111 . In 2003 , Rudolph confessed to the bombing and a series of related attacks on abortion centers and a gay bar , and was sentenced to life in prison . He claimed that the bombing was meant to protest the U.S. government 's sanctioning of abortion on demand .

In exact terms the area refers to the Mediterranean world , the extensive tracts of land centered on the Mediterranean and Black Sea basins , the swimming-pool and spa of the Greeks and Romans , i.e . one wherein the cultural perceptions , ideas and sensitivities of these peoples were dominant . This process was aided by the universal adoption of Greek as the language of intellectual culture and commerce in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea , and of Latin as the tongue for public management and forensic advocacy , especially in the Western Mediterranean . Though Greek and Latin never became the native idioms of the rural peasants who composed the great majority of the empire 's population , they were the languages of the urbanites and cosmopolitan elites , and the lingua franca , even if only as corrupt or multifarious dialects to those who lived within the large territories and populations outside the Macedonian settlements and the Roman colonies . All Roman citizens of note and accomplishment regardless of their ethnic extractions , spoke and wrote in Greek and/or Latin , such as the Roman jurist and Imperial chancellor Ulpian who was of Phoenician origin , the mathematician and geographer Claudius Ptolemy who was of Greco-Egyptian origin and the famous post-Constantinian thinkers John Chrysostom and Augustine who were of Syrian and Berber origins , respectively , and the historian Josephus Flavius who was of Jewish origin and spoke and wrote in Greek .",
