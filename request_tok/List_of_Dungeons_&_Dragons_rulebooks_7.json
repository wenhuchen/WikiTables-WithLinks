  "/wiki/Forgotten_Realms": "Forgotten Realms is a campaign setting for the Dungeons & Dragons ( D & D ) fantasy role-playing game . Commonly referred to by players and game designers alike as The Realms , it was created by game designer Ed Greenwood around 1967 as a setting for his childhood stories . Several years later , Greenwood brought the setting to publication for the D & D game as a series of magazine articles , and the first Realms game products were released in 1987 . Role-playing game products have been produced for the setting ever since , as have various licensed products including novels , role-playing video game adaptations ( including the first massively multiplayer online role-playing game to use graphics ) , and comic books . The Forgotten Realms is one of the most popular D & D settings , largely due to the success of novels by authors such as R. A. Salvatore and numerous role-playing video games , including Pool of Radiance ( 1988 ) , Eye of the Beholder ( 1991 ) , Baldur 's Gate ( 1998 ) , Icewind Dale ( 2000 ) , Baldur 's Gate II : Shadows of Amn ( 2000 ) , and Neverwinter Nights ( 2002 ) . The Forgotten Realms is a fantasy world setting , described as a world of strange lands , dangerous creatures , and mighty deities , where magic and supernatural phenomena are quite real . The premise is that , long ago , the Earth and the world of the Forgotten Realms were more closely connected . As time passed , the inhabitants of planet Earth have mostly forgotten about the existence of that other world - hence the name Forgotten Realms . On the original Forgotten Realms logo , which was used until 2000 , small runic letters read Herein lie the lost lands , an allusion to the connection between the two worlds .",
  "/wiki/Dragonlance": "Dragonlance is a shared universe created by Laura and Tracy Hickman , and expanded by Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis under the direction of TSR , Inc. into a series of fantasy novels . The Hickmans conceived Dragonlance while driving in their car on the way to TSR for a job interview . At TSR Tracy Hickman met Margaret Weis , his future writing partner , and they gathered a group of associates to play the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game . The adventures during that game inspired a series of gaming modules , a series of novels , licensed products such as board games , and lead miniature figures . In 1984 , TSR published the first Dragonlance novel , Dragons of Autumn Twilight . It began the Chronicles trilogy , a core element of the Dragonlance world . While the authoring team of Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis wrote the setting 's central books , numerous other authors contributed novels and short stories to the setting . Over 190 novels have used the Dragonlance setting , and have been accompanied by supplemental Dungeons & Dragons campaign setting material for over a decade . In 1997 , Wizards of the Coast LLC purchased TSR , and licensed Dragonlance to Sovereign Press , Inc in 2001 to produce game materials ; this licensing agreement expired in 2007 . The fictional Dragonlance world of Krynn contains numerous characters , an extensive timeline , and a detailed geography . The history of Krynn consists of five ages . The novels and related game products are primarily set in the fourth age , The Age of Despair .",
  "/wiki/Greyhawk": "Greyhawk , also known as the World of Greyhawk , is a fictional world designed as a campaign setting for the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy roleplaying game . Although not the first campaign world developed for Dungeons & Dragons - Dave Arneson 's Blackmoor campaign predated it by over a year - the world of Greyhawk closely identified with the development of the game from 1972 until 2008 . The world itself started as a simple dungeon under a castle designed by Gary Gygax for the amusement of his children and friends , but it rapidly expanded to include not only a complex multi-layered dungeon environment , but also the nearby city of Greyhawk , and eventually an entire world . In addition to the campaign world , which was published in several editions over twenty years , Greyhawk was also used as the setting for many adventures published in support of the game , as well as for RPGA 's massively shared Living Greyhawk campaign from 2000-2008 .",
  "/wiki/Kara-Tur": "Kara-Tur is a fantasy world created by David Cook which first appeared in the Oriental Adventures rulebook for the first edition of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game in 1986 . Kara-Tur 's cultures and peoples are fantasy analogues of medieval China , Korea , Japan , the Ryukyu Islands , Tibet , and other regions of East Asia . In 1987 , Kara-Tur was placed on the same fictional world as the Forgotten Realms campaign setting .",
  "/wiki/Spelljammer": "Spelljammer is a campaign setting for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons ( 2nd edition ) role-playing game , which features a fantastic ( as opposed to scientific ) outer space environment . Spelljammer introduced into the AD & D universe a comprehensive system of fantasy astrophysics , including the Ptolemaic concept of crystal spheres . Crystal spheres may contain multiple worlds and are navigable using ships equipped with spelljamming helms . Ships powered by spelljamming helms are capable of flying into not only the sky but into space . With their own fields of gravity and atmosphere , the ships have open decks and tend not to resemble the spaceships of science fiction , but instead look more like galleons , animals , birds , fish or even more wildly fantastic shapes . The Spelljammer setting is designed to allow the usual sword and sorcery adventures of Dungeons & Dragons to take place within the framework of outer space tropes . Flying ships travel through the vast expanses of interplanetary space , visiting moons and planets and other stellar objects . Like the Planescape setting , Spelljammer unifies most of the other AD & D settings and provides a canonical method for allowing characters from one setting ( such as Dragonlance ) to travel to another ( such as the Forgotten Realms ) . However , unlike Planescape it keeps all of the action on the Prime Material Plane and uses the crystal spheres , and the phlogiston between them , to form natural barriers between otherwise incompatible settings . Though the cosmology is derived largely from the Ptolemaic system of astronomy , many of the ideas owe much to the works of Jules Verne and his contemporaries , and to related games and fiction with a steampunk or planetary romance flavor . A strong Age of Sail flavor is also present .",
  "/wiki/Outer_Plane": "In the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons , an Outer Plane is one of a number of general types of planes of existence . They can also be referred to as godly planes , spiritual planes or divine planes . The Outer Planes are home to beings such as deities and otherworldly creatures such as demons , celestials and devils . Each Outer Plane is usually the physical manifestation of a particular moral and ethical alignment and the entities that dwell there often embody the traits related to that alignment . The intangible and esoteric Outer Planes - the realms of ideals , philosophies , and gods - stand in contrast to the Inner Planes , which compose the material building blocks of reality and the realms of energy and matter . All Outer Planes are spatially infinite but are composed of features and locations of finite scope . Many of these planes are often split into a collection of further infinites called layers , which are essentially sub-planes that represent one particular facet or theme of the plane . For example , Baator 's geography is reminiscent of Hell as depicted in Dante 's The Divine Comedy . In addition , each layer may also contain a number of realms . Each realm is the home to an individual deity , or occasionally a collection of deities .",
  "/wiki/Ravenloft": "Ravenloft is a fictional place , a campaign setting for the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game . It is an alternate time-space existence known as a pocket dimension or demiplane , called the Demiplane of Dread , which consists of a collection of land pieces called domains , brought together by a mysterious force known only as the Dark Powers . Each domain is tailored to and mystically ruled by a being called a Darklord who is forever trapped and surrounded by magical mists surrounding the domain . Strahd Von Zarovich , a vampire in the original AD & D Ravenloft I6 module 1983 , became the first Darklord , both ruler and prisoner of his own personal domain of Barovia . How Count Von Zarovich became the darklord of Barovia was detailed in the novel , I , Strahd : The Memoirs of a Vampire . As originally established in the Ravenloft : Realm of Terror boxed set known as the Black Box released in 1990 , The Ravenloft campaign setting was located in the Ethereal Plane . As a physical manifestation of that plane , lands , monsters and even people were created out of the mysterious mists , and the realm acted as a prison where one could enter or be transported , but means of escape were few . Other Ravenloft Domains and Darklords were eventually added in various AD & D 2nd edition ( and then later in 3rd edition ) products establishing a core continent attached around Barovia which could be traveled to by others if their respective lords allowed entering or leaving their borders ; while some Domains remained isolated in the mists and were referred to as Islands .",
  "/wiki/Dark_Sun": "Dark Sun is an original Dungeons & Dragons ( D & D ) campaign setting set in the fictional , post-apocalyptic desert world of Athas . Dark Sun featured an innovative metaplot , influential art work , dark themes , and a genre-bending take on traditional fantasy role-playing . The product line began with the original Dark Sun Boxed Set released for D & D 's 2nd edition in 1991 , originally ran until 1996 , and was one of TSR 's most successful releases . Dark Sun deviated from the feudalistic backdrops of its Tolkienesque pseudo-medieval contemporaries , such as Greyhawk or Forgotten Realms , in favor of a composite of dark fantasy , planetary romance , and the Dying Earth subgenre . Dark Sun 's designers presented a savage , magic-ravaged desert world where resources are scarce and survival is a daily struggle . The traditional fantasy races and character classes were altered or omitted to better suit the setting 's darker themes . Dark Sun differs further in that the game has no deities , arcane magic is reviled for causing the planet 's current ecological fragility , and psionics are extremely common . The artwork of Brom established a trend of game products produced under the direction of a single artist . The setting was also the first TSR setting to come with an established metaplot out of the box . Dark Sun 's popularity endured long after the setting was no longer supported , with a lively online community developing around it . Only third-party material was produced for the third edition D & D rules , but a new official edition of Dark Sun was released in 2010 for the fourth edition .",
  "/wiki/Al-Qadim": "Al-Qadim is a campaign setting for the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game which was developed by Jeff Grubb with Andria Hayday for TSR , Inc. , and was first released in 1992 . Al-Qadim uses One Thousand and One Nights as a theme and is set in the land of Zakhara , called the Land of Fate . Thematically , the land of Zakhara is a blend of the historical Muslim Caliphates , the stories of legend , and a wealth of Hollywood cinematic history . Zakhara is a peninsula on the continent of Faer\u00fbn in the world of Toril , the locale of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting , although Al-Qadim is designed to stand on its own or be added to any existing campaign setting . The basic campaign setting was divided between two game products : Al-Qadim : Arabian Adventures , a sourcebook describing character creation rules , equipment , and spells unique to the setting , and Al-Qadim : Land of Fate , a boxed set describing the land of Zakhara , with separate sourcebooks for the players and the Dungeon Master .",
  "/wiki/Fiend_Folio": "Fiend Folio is any of three products published for successive editions of the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons ( D & D ) . All three are collections of monsters . The bulk of the material in the first edition came from the British gaming magazine White Dwarf , rather than being authored by Gary Gygax , the game 's co-creator . Readers and gamers had submitted creatures to the Fiend Factory department of the magazine , and the most highly regarded of those appearing in the first thirteen issues were selected to be in the publication .",
  "/wiki/Planescape": "Planescape is a campaign setting for the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game , originally designed by Zeb Cook . The Planescape setting was published in 1994 . As its name suggests , the setting crosses and comprises the numerous planes of existence , encompassing an entire cosmology called the Great Wheel , as originally developed in the original 1987 Manual of the Planes by Jeff Grubb . This includes many of the other Dungeons & Dragons worlds , linking them via inter-dimensional magical portals ."
