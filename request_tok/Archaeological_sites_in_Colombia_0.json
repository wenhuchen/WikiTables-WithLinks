The end of the Pleistocene corresponds with the end of the last glacial period and also with the end of the Paleolithic age used in archaeology . The Pleistocene is the first epoch of the Quaternary Period or sixth epoch of the Cenozoic Era . In the ICS timescale , the Pleistocene is divided into four stages or ages , the Gelasian , Calabrian , Chibanian , and Upper Pleistocene ( unofficially the Tarantian ) . [ note 1 ] In addition to these international subdivisions , various regional subdivisions are often used . Before a change finally confirmed in 2009 by the International Union of Geological Sciences , the time boundary between the Pleistocene and the preceding Pliocene was regarded as being at 1.806 million years Before Present ( BP ) , as opposed to the currently accepted 2.58 million years BP . Publications from the preceding years may use either definition of the period .",

  "/wiki/Herrera_Period": "The Herrera Period is a phase in the history of Colombia . It is part of the Andean preceramic and ceramic , time equivalent of the North American pre-Columbian formative and classic stages and age dated by various archaeologists . The Herrera Period predates the age of the Muisca , who inhabited the Altiplano Cundiboyacense before the Spanish conquest of the Muisca and postdates the prehistory of the region in Colombia . The Herrera Period is usually defined as ranging from 800 BCE to 800 CE , although some scholars date it as early as 1500 BCE . Ample evidence of the Herrera Period has been uncovered on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense . The main archaeologists contributing to the present knowledge about the Herrera Period are the scholars Ana Mar\u00eda Groot , Gonzalo Correal Urrego , Thomas van der Hammen , Carl Henrik Langebaek Rueda , Sylvia M. Broadbent , and Marianne Cardale de Schrimpff .",
  "/wiki/Muisca_people": "The Muisca ( also called Chibcha ) are an indigenous people and culture of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense , Colombia , that formed the Muisca Confederation before the Spanish conquest . The people spoke Muysccubun , a language of the Chibchan language family , also called Muysca and Mosca . As one out of four advanced civilizations of the Americas ( apart from the Aztec , Maya , and Incas ) , they were encountered by conquistadors ordered by the Spanish Empire in 1537 at the time of the conquest . Subgroupings of the Muisca were mostly identified by their allegiances to three great rulers : the zaque , centered in Hunza , ruling a territory roughly covering modern southern and northeastern Boyac\u00e1 and southern Santander ; the zipa , centered in Bacat\u00e1 and encompassing most of modern Cundinamarca , the western Llanos ; and the iraca , religious ruler of Suamox and modern northeastern Boyac\u00e1 and southwestern Santander . The territory of the Muisca spanned an area of around 25,000 km2 ( 9,700 sq mi ) from the north of Boyac\u00e1 to the Sumapaz P\u00e1ramo and from the summits to the western portion of the Eastern Ranges . Their territory bordered the lands of the Panche in the west , the Muzo in the northwest , the Guane in the north , the Lache in the northeast , the Achagua in the east , and the Sutagao in the south . At the time of the spaniard invasion , the area had a large population , although the precise number of inhabitants is not known . Estimates vary from half a million to up to three million inhabitants . Their subsistence economy was based on agriculture , salt mining , trading , metalworking , and manufacturing . In modern times , the population of the Muisca has drastically decreased , although in the municipalities and districts Cota , Ch\u00eda , Tenjo , Suba , Engativ\u00e1 , Tocancip\u00e1 , Gachancip\u00e1 , and Ubat\u00e9 , descendants of the Muisca are present . A census by the Ministry of Interior Affairs in 2005 provided a total of 14,051 Muisca people in Colombia . Important contributors to the knowledge about the Muisca have been their main conquistador , Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada ; Spanish poet , soldier , and priest Juan de Castellanos ( 16th century ) ; bishop Lucas Fern\u00e1ndez de Piedrahita and franciscan Pedro Sim\u00f3n ( 17th century ) ; and Javier Ocampo L\u00f3pez and Gonzalo Correal Urrego ( recent ) .",

The division lasted until the transitional period of the Chalcolithic from about 6,500 years ago ( 4500 BC ) , marked by the development of metallurgy , leading up to the Bronze Age and Iron Age . In Northern Europe , the Neolithic lasted until about 1700 BC , while in China it extended until 1200 BC . Other parts of the world ( including the New World ) remained broadly in the Neolithic stage of development until European contact . The Neolithic comprises a progression of behavioral and cultural characteristics and changes , including the use of wild and domestic crops and of domesticated animals .

  "/wiki/Puerto_Hormiga_archaeological_site": "The Puerto Hormiga archaeological site is located in the Bolivar department , Colombia , in the lower Magdalena basin near the Caribbean coast . It is dated 4000 - 3100 BC . Its traces provide evidence of a semi-sedentary agricultural society in the making , whose members were involved in hunting and gathering shellfish . Middens of shells were found there . According to other findings , such as ceramic remains and abundant stone material , the nomadic peoples were beginning to complement their activities with small-scale horticulture and agriculture . A shell ring of the Late Archaic period has been described at Puerto Hormiga . The Puerto Hormiga ring is composed primarily of clam shells , and is located in a marsh . It has an outside diameter of 280 feet ( 85 m ) , a height of about 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) , and the base of the ring mound is 52 feet ( 16 m ) to 75 feet ( 23 m ) wide . It has a clear interior plaza . Sherds of fiber-tempered and sand-tempered pottery , as well as stone tools , were found associated with the shell ring . The earliest have been dated to 3794 BC . The fiber-tempered pottery is crude , formed from a single lump of clay .",
  "/wiki/Aguazuque": "Aguazuque is a pre-Columbian archaeological site located in the western part of the municipality Soacha , close to the municipalities Mosquera and San Antonio del Tequendama in Cundinamarca , Colombia . It exists of evidences of human settlement of hunter-gatherers and in the ultimate phase primitive farmers . The site is situated on the Bogot\u00e1 savanna , the relatively flat highland of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense close to the present-day course of the Bogot\u00e1 River at an altitude of 2,600 metres ( 8,500 ft ) above sea level . Aguazuque is just north of another Andean preceramic archaeological site ; the rock shelter Tequendama and a few kilometres south of Lake Herrera . The artefacts found mostly belong to the preceramic period , and have been dated to 5025 to 2725 BP ( 3000 to 700 BCE ) . Thus , the younger finds also pertain to the later ceramic Herrera Period . There were some difficulties in dating of the uppermost layer due to modern agricultural activity in the area ; the sediments of the shallower parts were disturbed . At Aguazuque multiple palaeoantropological finds have been made ; stone and bone tools , remains of fireplaces and a multitude of pre-Columbian foods , primitive circular housing , various burial sites of individual and group interments and in the youngest dated layers , evidences of ceramics . The site represents a transition from a hunter-gatherer culture towards the earliest evidence of agriculture . A phase of settlement is attested where the people moved away from the caves and rock shelters and started inhabiting open area grounds . Investigation of Aguazuque has been conducted since 1986 , mainly by archaeologist Gonzalo Correal Urrego who published the results of his studies in the book Aguazuque - evidencias de cazadores , recolectores y plantadores en la altiplanicie de la Cordillera Oriental in 1990 .",

The pyramid dates to at least 1535 , as the Spanish Empire found it abandoned when they arrived in that year . Research suggests that the individuals buried there came from the very top of the social classes of their society . The pyramid was constructed in the pre-Columbian period , approximately between 1600 - 500 BC ; the period which is now known as the Delayed Cacicales Societies .

These lands lie within the departments of C\u00f3rdoba and Sucre . The Zen\u00fa culture existed from about 200 BCE to about 1600 CE , constructing major water works and producing gold ornaments . The gold that was often buried with their dead lured the Spanish conquerors , who looted much of the gold . With the arrival of the Spaniards , the tribe all but died out . The 16th-century Spanish chroniclers wrote about the Zen\u00fa who were still living there , but recorded little or nothing about the history of the Zen\u00fa . In 1966 the geographer James Parsons drew attention to rake-like patterns that were visible on aerial photographs of the wetlands in the lower reaches of the river San Jorge , patterns that could not have arisen naturally . Ten years later a major reconstructive research started .",

  "/wiki/Tairona": "Tairona was a Pre-Columbian culture of Colombia , which consisted in a group of chiefdoms in the region of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in present-day Cesar , Magdalena and La Guajira Departments of Colombia , South America , which goes back at least to the 1st century AD and had significant demographic growth around the 11th century . The Tairona people formed one of the two principal linguistic groups of the Chibchan family , the other being the Muisca . Genetic and archaeological evidence shows a relatively dense occupation of the region by at least 200 BC . Pollen data compiled by Luisa Fernanda Herrera in 1980 shows considerable deforestation and the use of cultigens such as yuca and maiz since possibly 1200 BC . However , occupation of the Colombian Caribbean coast by sedentary or semi-sedentary populations has been documented to have occurred by c. 4000 BC . Ethnohistorical data shows that initial contact with the Spanish was tolerated by the Tairona ; but by 1600 AD confrontations grew , and a small part of the Tairona population moved to the higher stretches of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta . This movement allowed them to evade the worst of the Spanish colonial system during the 17th and 18th centuries . The indigenous Kogi , Wiwa , Arhuacos ( Ijka , Ifca ) and Kankuamo people who live in the area today are believed to be direct descendants of the Tairona .",
