Their first official production Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil was a success in 1984 , and after securing a second year of funding , Lalibert\u00e9 hired Guy Caron from the National Circus School to recreate it as a proper circus . Its theatrical , character-driven approach and the absence of performing animals helped define Cirque du Soleil as the contemporary circus ( nouveau cirque ) that it remains today . After financial successes and failures in the late 1980s , Nouvelle Exp\u00e9rience was created - with the direction of Franco Dragone - which not only made Cirque du Soleil profitable by 1990 , but allowed it to create new shows . Cirque du Soleil expanded rapidly through the 1990s and 2000s , growing from one show to 19 shows in over 300 cities on every continent except Antarctica .

The Grand Canyon is 277 miles ( 446 km ) long , up to 18 miles ( 29 km ) wide and attains a depth of over a mile ( 6,093 feet or 1,857 meters ) . The canyon and adjacent rim are contained within Grand Canyon National Park , the Kaibab National Forest , Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument , the Hualapai Indian Reservation , the Havasupai Indian Reservation and the Navajo Nation . President Theodore Roosevelt was a major proponent of preservation of the Grand Canyon area , and visited it on numerous occasions to hunt and enjoy the scenery . Nearly two billion years of Earth 's geological history have been exposed as the Colorado River and its tributaries cut their channels through layer after layer of rock while the Colorado Plateau was uplifted . While some aspects about the history of incision of the canyon are debated by geologists , several recent studies support the hypothesis that the Colorado River established its course through the area about 5 to 6 million years ago . Since that time , the Colorado River has driven the down-cutting of the tributaries and retreat of the cliffs , simultaneously deepening and widening the canyon . For thousands of years , the area has been continuously inhabited by Native Americans , who built settlements within the canyon and its many caves . The Pueblo people considered the Grand Canyon a holy site , and made pilgrimages to it . The first European known to have viewed the Grand Canyon was Garc\u00eda L\u00f3pez de C\u00e1rdenas from Spain , who arrived in 1540 .",
