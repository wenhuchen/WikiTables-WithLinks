  "/wiki/Fiber_Channel": "Fibre Channel ( FC ) is a high-speed data transfer protocol ( commonly running at 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , and 128 gigabit per second rates ) providing in-order , lossless delivery of raw block data . Fibre Channel is primarily used to connect computer data storage to servers in storage area networks ( SAN ) in commercial data centers . Fibre Channel networks form a switched fabric because the switches in a network operate in unison as one big switch . Fibre Channel typically runs on optical fiber cables within and between data centers , but can also run on copper cabling . There are various upper level protocols for Fibre Channel , including two for block storage . Fibre Channel Protocol ( FCP ) is a protocol that transports SCSI commands over Fibre Channel networks . FICON is a protocol that transports ESCON commands , used by Mainframe computers , over Fibre Channel . Fibre Channel can be used to transport data from storage systems that use solid-state flash memory storage medium by transporting NVMe protocol commands .",
  "/wiki/ISCSI": "In essence , iSCSI allows two hosts to negotiate and then exchange SCSI commands using Internet Protocol ( IP ) networks . By doing this , iSCSI takes a popular high-performance local storage bus and emulates it over a wide range of networks , creating a storage area network ( SAN ) . Unlike some SAN protocols , iSCSI requires no dedicated cabling ; it can be run over existing IP infrastructure . As a result , iSCSI is often seen as a low-cost alternative to Fibre Channel , which requires dedicated infrastructure except in its FCoE ( Fibre Channel over Ethernet ) form . However , the performance of an iSCSI SAN deployment can be severely degraded if not operated on a dedicated network or subnet ( LAN or VLAN ) , due to competition for a fixed amount of bandwidth . Although iSCSI can communicate with arbitrary types of SCSI devices , system administrators almost always use it to allow servers ( such as database servers ) to access disk volumes on storage arrays . iSCSI SANs often have one of two objectives :",
