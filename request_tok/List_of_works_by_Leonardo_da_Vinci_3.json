It is housed in the National Gallery , London . This painting is similar to an earlier painting depicting Tobias and the Angel , by Antonio del Pollaiolo . According to Oxford art historian Martin Kemp , Leonardo da Vinci , who was a member of Verrocchio 's studio , may have painted some part of this work , most likely the fish . David Alan Brown , of the National Gallery in Washington , attributes the painting of the fluffy little dog to him as well .

  "/wiki/La_Bella_Principessa": "La Bella Principessa ( English : The Beautiful Princess ) , also known as Portrait of Bianca Sforza , Young Girl in Profile in Renaissance Dress and Portrait of a Young Fianc\u00e9e , is a portrait in coloured chalks and ink , on vellum , of a young lady in fashionable costume and hairstyle of a Milanese of the 1490s . Some scholars have attributed it to Leonardo da Vinci but the attribution and the work 's authenticity have been disputed . Some of those who disagree with the attribution to Leonardo believe the portrait is by an early 19th-century German artist imitating the style of the Italian Renaissance , although radiocarbon dating tests show a much earlier date for the vellum . It has also been denounced as a forgery . The white lead has been dated to be at least 225 years old . The work sold for just under $ 22,000 at auction in 1998 , and was bought by its current owner Peter Silverman in 2007 . He has championed the attribution to Leonardo , supported by the analysis of academics Martin Kemp and Pascal Cotte . The drawing was shown as a Leonardo in an exhibition in Sweden in 2010 and was estimated by various newspaper reports to be worth more than $ 160 million . The Bella Principessa remains locked in a vault in a secret Swiss location . According to Kemp and Cotte , the sheet was cut from a Milanese vellum book , La Sforziada , in Warsaw , which celebrates the marriage in 1496 of Galeazzo Sanseverino with Bianca , the illegitimate daughter of Ludovico Sforza , Leonardo 's employer . It has subsequently been exhibited in Urbino , Monza and Nanjing ; and a facsimile edition of the portrait and the book in Warsaw has been published .",

Ingres was profoundly influenced by past artistic traditions and aspired to become the guardian of academic orthodoxy against the ascendant Romantic style . Although he considered himself a painter of history in the tradition of Nicolas Poussin and Jacques-Louis David , it is his portraits , both painted and drawn , that are recognized as his greatest legacy . His expressive distortions of form and space made him an important precursor of modern art , influencing Picasso , Matisse and other modernists . Born into a modest family in Montauban , he travelled to Paris to study in the studio of David . In 1802 he made his Salon debut , and won the Prix de Rome for his painting The Ambassadors of Agamemnon in the tent of Achilles . By the time he departed in 1806 for his residency in Rome , his style - revealing his close study of Italian and Flemish Renaissance masters - was fully developed , and would change little for the rest of his life . While working in Rome and subsequently Florence from 1806 to 1824 , he regularly sent paintings to the Paris Salon , where they were faulted by critics who found his style bizarre and archaic . He received few commissions during this period for the history paintings he aspired to paint , but was able to support himself and his wife as a portrait painter and draughtsman . He was finally recognized at the Salon in 1824 , when his Raphaelesque painting of the Vow of Louis XIII was met with acclaim , and Ingres was acknowledged as the leader of the Neoclassical school in France . Although the income from commissions for history paintings allowed him to paint fewer portraits , his Portrait of Monsieur Bertin marked his next popular success in 1833 . The following year , his indignation at the harsh criticism of his ambitious composition The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian caused him to return to Italy , where he assumed directorship of the French Academy in Rome in 1835 .",

Marco , and his original name Baccio della Porta , was an Italian Renaissance painter of religious subjects . He spent all his career in Florence until his mid-forties , when he travelled to work in various cities , as far south as Rome . He trained with Cosimo Roselli and in the 1490s fell under the influence of Savonarola , which led him to become a Dominican friar in 1500 , renouncing painting for several years . He was instructed to resume painting for the benefit of his order in 1504 , and then developed an idealized High Renaissance style , seen in his Vision of St Bernard of that year , now in poor condition but whose figures and drapery move with a seraphic grace that must have struck the young Raphael with the force of revelation . He remained friends with Raphael , and each influenced the other . His portrait of Savonarola remains the best known image of the reformer .

  "/wiki/Lucretia": "According to Roman tradition , Lucretia ( /lu\u02d0\u02c8kri\u02d0\u0283\u0259/ loo-KREE-sh\u0259 , Classical Latin : [ l\u028a\u02c8kre\u02d0t\u026a.a ] ; died c. 510 BC ) , anglicized as Lucrece , was a noblewoman in ancient Rome whose rape by Sextus Tarquinius ( Tarquin ) , an Etruscan king 's son , was the cause of a rebellion that overthrew the Roman monarchy and led to the transition of Roman government from a kingdom to a republic . There are no contemporary sources ; information regarding Lucretia , her rape and suicide , and the consequence of this being the start of the Roman Republic , come from the later accounts of Roman historian Livy and Greco-Roman historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus . The incident kindled the flames of dissatisfaction over the tyrannical methods of the last king of Rome , Lucius Tarquinius Superbus . As a result , the prominent families instituted a republic , drove the extensive royal family of Tarquin from Rome , and successfully defended the republic against attempted Etruscan and Latin intervention . As a result of its sheer impact , the rape itself became a major theme in European art and literature . One of the first two consuls of the Roman Republic , Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus was Lucretia 's husband . All the numerous sources on the establishment of the republic reiterate the basic events of Lucretia 's story , though accounts vary slightly . Lucretia 's story is not considered a myth by most historians , but rather a historical legend about an early history that was already a major part of Roman folklore before it was first written about . The evidence points to the historical existence of a woman named Lucretia and a historical incident that played a critical part in the real downfall of a real monarchy . Many of the specific details , though , are debatable , and vary depending on the writer . Post-Roman uses of the legend typically became mythical in portrayal , being of artistic rather than historical merit . As the events of the story move rapidly , the date of the incident is probably the same year as the first of the fasti .",

  "/wiki/Archimedean_solid": "In geometry , an Archimedean solid is one of the 13 solids first enumerated by Archimedes . They are the convex uniform polyhedra composed of regular polygons meeting in identical vertices , excluding the 5 Platonic solids ( which are composed of only one type of polygon ) and excluding the prisms and antiprisms . They differ from the Johnson solids , whose regular polygonal faces do not meet in identical vertices . Identical vertices means that each two vertices are symmetric to each other : A global isometry of the entire solid takes one vertex to the other while laying the solid directly on its initial position . Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum ( 2009 ) observed that a 14th polyhedron , the elongated square gyrobicupola ( or pseudo-rhombicuboctahedron ) , meets a weaker definition of an Archimedean solid , in which identical vertices means merely that the faces surrounding each vertex are of the same types ( i.e . each vertex looks the same from close up ) , so only a local isometry is required . Gr\u00fcnbaum pointed out a frequent error in which authors define Archimedean solids using this local definition but omit the 14th polyhedron . If only 13 polyhedra are to be listed , the definition must use global symmetries of the polyhedron rather than local neighborhoods . Prisms and antiprisms , whose symmetry groups are the dihedral groups , are generally not considered to be Archimedean solids , even though their faces are regular polygons and their symmetry groups act transitively on their vertices . Excluding these two infinite families , there are 13 Archimedean solids . All the Archimedean solids ( but not the elongated square gyrobicupola ) can be made via Wythoff constructions from the Platonic solids with tetrahedral , octahedral and icosahedral symmetry .",

In a monograph published shortly thereafter , Blaker 's stepfather , John R.

The painting was subsequently bought by Henry F. Pulitzer , who argued that it was Leonardo 's only real portrait of Lisa Gherardini .

It strongly resembles a portrait of Leonardo da Vinci by Cristofano dell'Altissimo held by the Uffizi Gallery . The painting was previously thought by its owners to represent Galileo but on its discovery a claim was made that it is a self-portrait by Leonardo da Vinci . Alessandro Vezzosi , director of the Museo Ideale Leonardo da Vinci at Vinci said in 2011 that he had excluded the possibility that it was a self-portrait , but that the painting remains intriguing because it adds a new element to the Leonardo puzzle . Painted in tempera grassa on panel , 60 by 40 centimetres ( 24 in \u00d7 16 in ) , it depicts a man in three-quarter view , with a long beard and wearing a dark hat . In 2019 it is being exhibited in Madrid along with other material related to Leonardo . It is usually in the Museo delle Antiche Genti di Lucania ( Museum of the Ancient People of Lucania ) in Vaglio Basilicata , a region of Southern Italy . In 2008 Nicola Barbatelli , Director of the Museo , discovered the painting , attributed it to Leonardo , and gave it the name Lucan portrait , from Lucania , the ancient name of Basilicata .

  "/wiki/Bacchus_(Leonardo)": "Bacchus , formerly Saint John the Baptist , is a painting in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre , Paris , France , based on a drawing by the Italian Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci . It is presumed to have been executed by an unknown follower , perhaps in Leonardo 's workshop . Sydney J. Freedberg assigns the drawing to Leonardo 's second Milan period . Among the Lombard painters who have been suggested as possible authors are Cesare da Sesto , [ a ] Marco d'Oggiono , Francesco Melzi , and Cesare Bernazzano . The painting shows a male figure with garlanded head and leopard skin , seated in an idyllic landscape . He points with his right hand off to his left , and with his left hand grasps his thyrsus and also points down to earth . The painting originally depicted John the Baptist . In the late 17th century , between the years 1683 and 1693 , it was overpainted and altered to serve as Bacchus . [ b ] Cassiano dal Pozzo remarked of the painting in its former state , which he saw at Fontainebleau in 1625 , that it had neither devotion , decorum nor similitude , the suavely beautiful , youthful and slightly androgynous Giovannino was so at variance with artistic conventions in portraying the Baptist - neither the older ascetic prophet nor the Florentine baby Giovannino , but a type of Leonardo 's invention , of a disconcerting , somewhat ambiguous sensuality , familiar in Leonardo 's half-length and upward-pointing Saint John the Baptist , also in the Louvre . The overpainting transformed the image of St. John into one of a pagan deity , by converting the long-handled cross-like staff of the Baptist to a Bacchic thyrsus and adding a vine wreath . The fur robe is the legacy of John the Baptist , but has been overpainted with leopard-spots relating , like the wreath , to Bacchus , the Roman god of wine and intoxication ."
