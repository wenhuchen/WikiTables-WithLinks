  "/wiki/Caliber": "In guns , particularly firearms , caliber ( or calibre in British English ) is the specified nominal internal diameter of the gun barrel bore regardless of how or where the bore is measured and whether or not the finished bore matches that specification . It is measured in inches to an accuracy of hundredths or thousandths of an inch or in millimeters . For example , a .45 caliber firearm has a barrel diameter of roughly 0.45 inches ( 11 mm ) . Barrel diameters can also be expressed using metric dimensions . For example , a 9 mm pistol has a barrel diameter of about 9 millimeters . Due to the inaccuracy and imprecision of imperial dimensions converted to metric units , metric designations are typically far out of specifications published in decimal inches . True caliber specifications require imperial measure , and even when cartridge designations ( often mistakenly referred to as caliber ) only specify caliber to even tenths or hundredths of an inch , actual barrel/chamber/projectile dimensions are published to at least thousandths of an inch and frequently tolerances extend into ten-thousandths of an inch . In a rifled barrel , the distance is measured between opposing lands or between opposing grooves ; groove measurements are common in cartridge designations originating in the United States , while land measurements are more common elsewhere in the world . Measurements across the grooves are used for maximum precision because rifling and the specific caliber so-measured is the result of final machining process which cuts grooves into the rough bore leaving the lands behind . Good performance requires a concentric , straight bore that accurately centers the projectile within , in preference to a tight fit which can be achieved even with off-center , crooked bores that cause excessive friction , fouling and an out-of-balance , wobbling projectile in flight . While modern firearms are generally referred to by the name of the cartridge the gun is chambered for , they are still categorized together based on bore diameter . For example , a firearm might be described as a 30 caliber rifle , which could be any of a wide range of cartridges using a roughly 0.30 inches ( 7.6 mm ) projectile ; or a 22 rimfire , referring to any rimfire firearms firing cartridges with a .22 caliber projectile .",

  "/wiki/German_Empire": "The German Empire ( German : Deutsches Kaiserreich , officially Deutsches Reich ) , sometimes referred to as Imperial Germany , was the German nation state that existed from the unification of Germany in 1871 until the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II in 1918 . It was founded on 1 January 1871 when the south German states , except for Austria , joined the North German Confederation and the new constitution came into force changing the name of the federal state to the German Empire and introduced the title of German Emperor for Wilhelm I , King of Prussia from the House of Hohenzollern . Berlin remained its capital , and Otto , Prince of Bismarck , Minister-President of Prussia became Chancellor , the head of government . As these events occurred , the Prussian-led North German Confederation and its southern German allies were still engaged in the Franco-Prussian War . The German Empire consisted of 26 states , most of them ruled by royal families . They included four kingdoms , six grand duchies , five duchies ( six before 1876 ) , seven principalities , three free Hanseatic cities , and one imperial territory . Although Prussia was one of several kingdoms in the realm , it contained about two thirds of Germany 's population and territory . Prussian dominance had also been established constitutionally . After 1850 , the states of Germany had rapidly become industrialized , with particular strengths in coal , iron ( and later steel ) , chemicals , and railways . In 1871 , Germany had a population of 41 million people ; by 1913 , this had increased to 68 million . A heavily rural collection of states in 1815 , the now united Germany became predominantly urban . During its 47 years of existence , the German Empire was an industrial , technological , and scientific giant , gaining more Nobel Prizes in science than any other country .",
  "/wiki/World_War_I": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",

  "/wiki/Canon_de_75_mod\u00e8le_1897": "The French 75 mm field gun was a quick-firing field artillery piece adopted in March 1898 . Its official French designation was : Mat\u00e9riel de 75mm Mle 1897 . It was commonly known as the French 75 , simply the 75 and Soixante-Quinze ( French for seventy-five ) . The French 75 was designed as an anti-personnel weapon system for delivering large volumes of time-fused shrapnel shells on enemy troops advancing in the open . After 1915 and the onset of trench warfare , other types of battlefield missions demanding impact-detonated high-explosive shells prevailed . By 1918 the 75s became the main agents of delivery for toxic gas shells . The 75s also became widely used as truck mounted anti-aircraft artillery . They were also the main armament of the Saint-Chamond tank in 1918 . The French 75 is widely regarded as the first modern artillery piece . It was the first field gun to include a hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism , which kept the gun 's trail and wheels perfectly still during the firing sequence . Since it did not need to be re-aimed after each shot , the crew could reload and fire as soon as the barrel returned to its resting position . In typical use , the French 75 could deliver fifteen rounds per minute on its target , either shrapnel or melinite high-explosive , up to about 8,500 m ( 5.3 mi ) away .",

  "/wiki/Mexican_Revolution": "The Mexican Revolution ( Spanish : Revoluci\u00f3n Mexicana ) was a major armed struggle , lasting roughly from 1910 to 1920 , that transformed Mexican culture and government . Although recent research has focused on local and regional aspects of the Revolution , it was a genuinely national revolution . Its outbreak in 1910 resulted from the failure of the 31-year-long regime of Porfirio D\u00edaz to find a managed solution to presidential succession . This meant there was a political crisis among competing elites and the opportunity for agrarian insurrection . Wealthy landowner Francisco I. Madero challenged D\u00edaz in the 1910 presidential election , and following the rigged results , revolted under the Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed . Armed conflict broke out in northern Mexico and D\u00edaz was forced out . In the Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez , D\u00edaz resigned and went into exile , new elections were to occur in the fall , and an Interim Presidency under Francisco Le\u00f3n de la Barra was installed . A new election was held in 1911 , bringing Madero to the presidency . The origins of the conflict were broadly based in opposition to the D\u00edaz regime , with the 1910 election becoming the catalyst for the outbreak of political rebellion . The revolution was begun by elements of the Mexican elite hostile to D\u00edaz , led by Madero , Pascual Orozco , and Pancho Villa ; it expanded to the middle class , the peasantry in some regions and organized labor . In October 1911 , Madero was overwhelmingly elected in a free and fair election and took office in November . Opposition to his regime then grew from both the conservatives , who saw him as too weak and too liberal , and from former revolutionary fighters and the dispossessed , who saw him as too conservative .",
  "/wiki/Arab-Israeli_War": "The ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict refers to the political tension , military conflicts and disputes between Arab countries and Israel , which climaxed during the 20th century . The roots of the Arab-Israeli conflict have been attributed to the support by Arab League member countries for the Palestinians , a fellow-League member , in the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict , which in turn has been attributed to the simultaneous rise of Zionism and Arab nationalism towards the end of the 19th century , though the two national movements had not clashed until the 1920s . In 2002 , the Arab League offered recognition of Israel by Arab countries as part of the resolution of the Palestine-Israel conflict in the Arab Peace Initiative . The initiative , which has been reconfirmed since , calls for normalizing relations between the Arab region and Israel , in exchange for a full withdrawal by Israel from the occupied territories ( including East Jerusalem ) and a just settlement of the Palestinian refugee problem based on UN Resolution 194 . Part of the Palestine-Israel conflict arose from the conflicting claims by these movements to the land that formed the British Mandatory Palestine , which was regarded by the Jewish people as their ancestral homeland , while at the same time it was regarded by the Pan-Arab movement as historically and currently belonging to the Arab Palestinians , and in the Pan-Islamic context , as Muslim lands . There was sectarian conflict within the British Mandate territory between Palestinian Jews and Arabs commencing in the 1920s , escalating into a full-scale Palestinian civil war in 1947 . Taking the side of the Palestinian Arabs , especially following the Israeli Declaration of Independence , the neighbouring Arab countries invaded in May 1948 the by-then former Mandate territory , commencing the First Arab-Israeli War . Large-scale hostilities mostly ended with ceasefire agreements after the 1973 Yom Kippur War . Peace agreements were signed between Israel and Egypt in 1979 , resulting in Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula and the abolition of the military governance system in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , in favor of Israeli Civil Administration and consequent unilateral annexation of the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem . The nature of the conflict has shifted over the years from the large-scale , regional Arab-Israeli conflict to a more local Israeli-Palestinian conflict , which peaked during the 1982 Lebanon War . With the decline of the First Palestinian Intifada , the interim Oslo Accords led to the creation of the Palestinian National Authority in 1994 , within the context of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process . The same year Israel and Jordan reached a peace accord .",

This union formed the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , one of the largest ( over 1,000,000 square kilometres - 400,000 square miles ) and most populous countries of 16th and 17th century Europe , with a uniquely liberal political system which adopted Europe 's first written national constitution , the Constitution of 3 May 1791 .",

  "/wiki/Italy": "Italy ( Italian : Italia [ i\u02c8ta\u02d0lja ] ( listen ) ) , officially the Italian Republic ( Italian : Repubblica Italiana [ re\u02c8pubblika ita\u02c8lja\u02d0na ] ) , is a European country consisting of a peninsula delimited by the Alps and surrounded by several islands . Italy is located in south-central Europe , and it is also considered a part of Western Europe . The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",
  "/wiki/Cannone_da_75/27_modello_11": "The Cannone da 75/27 modello 11 was a French-designed field gun produced in Italy prior to World War I . It was introduced in 1912 , designed by Colonel Deport . It was taken into service by Italy for use with its Alpine and cavalry troops going into World War I , and was built there in large numbers . The gun was designed with two notable features . It was the first artillery piece to introduce the split trail , as well as the last to utilize its novel dual-recoil system . The former became a very popular feature on artillery pieces through to the modern day . The later , while functional , did not get repeated . The dual-recoil system consisted of a small tubular recoil under the barrel which in turn traveled in a traditional rectangular cradle . This lessened heat transfer from the gun barrel to the recoil mechanism effectively , but was not necessary for the added complexity . Some guns had two crew seats on the front of the gun shield . The gun was used by the Italian army throughout World War I and remained on strength well into World War II . Many pieces even saw service with German forces fighting in Northern Italy from 1943 until the end of the war , as the 7.5 cm Feldkanone 244 ( i ) ."
