  "/wiki/Telegraphic_address": "A telegraphic address or cable address was a unique identifier code for a recipient of telegraph messages . Operators of telegraph services regulated the use of telegraphic addresses to prevent duplication . Rather like a uniform resource locator ( URL ) , the telegraph address did not contain any routing information ( aside from possibly a city name ) , but instead could be looked up by telegraph office personnel , who would then manually direct the message to the office nearest the destination or to an intermediate office . Since the destination address of a telegram counted as part of the message , using a short registered address code saved the expense of sending a complete street address . Telegraph addresses were chosen either as versions of a company 's name or as a memorable short word somehow associated with the recipient . Occasionally , an organization would come to be best known by its telegraphic address , for example Interflora , Interpol and Oxfam . A telegraphic address was a valuable part of a company 's corporate identity , and disputes sometimes arose when a competitor registered a telegraphic address similar to a trade name or identifier used by a rival .",

Its rail network also serves Minneapolis-St. Paul , Milwaukee , Detroit , Chicago , and New York City in the United States .

It was Canada 's first transcontinental railway , but no longer reaches the Atlantic coast . Primarily a freight railway , the CPR was for decades the only practical means of long-distance passenger transport in most regions of Canada , and was instrumental in the settlement and development of Western Canada . The CPR became one of the largest and most powerful companies in Canada , a position it held as late as 1975 . Its primary passenger services were eliminated in 1986 , after being assumed by Via Rail Canada in 1978 . A beaver was chosen as the railway 's logo in honour of Sir Donald A Smith ( 1st .

Humboldt 's quantitative work on botanical geography laid the foundation for the field of biogeography . Humboldt 's advocacy of long-term systematic geophysical measurement laid the foundation for modern geomagnetic and meteorological monitoring . Between 1799 and 1804 , Humboldt travelled extensively in the Americas , exploring and describing them for the first time from a modern scientific point of view . His description of the journey was written up and published in an enormous set of volumes over 21 years . Humboldt was one of the first people to propose that the lands bordering the Atlantic Ocean were once joined ( South America and Africa in particular ) . Humboldt resurrected the use of the word cosmos from the ancient Greek and assigned it to his multivolume treatise , Kosmos , in which he sought to unify diverse branches of scientific knowledge and culture . This important work also motivated a holistic perception of the universe as one interacting entity . He was the first person to describe the phenomenon and cause of human-induced climate change , in 1800 and again in 1831 , based on observations generated during his travels .",

The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England .

Born in the Saxon duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld to a family connected to many of Europe 's ruling monarchs , at the age of twenty Albert married his cousin , Victoria ; they had nine children . Initially he felt constrained by his role of prince consort , which did not afford him power or responsibilities . He gradually developed a reputation for supporting public causes , such as educational reform and the abolition of slavery worldwide , and was entrusted with running the Queen 's household , office and estates . He was heavily involved with the organisation of the Great Exhibition of 1851 , which was a resounding success . Victoria came to depend more and more on Albert 's support and guidance . He aided the development of Britain 's constitutional monarchy by persuading his wife to be less partisan in her dealings with Parliament - although he actively disagreed with the interventionist foreign policy pursued during Lord Palmerston 's tenure as Foreign Secretary . Albert died following a long illness at the relatively young age of 42 . Victoria was so devastated at the loss of her husband that she entered into a deep state of mourning and wore black for the rest of her life .

Victoria was the daughter of Prince Edward , Duke of Kent and Strathearn ( the fourth son of King George III ) , and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld .

Unlike other planned cities in the Canadian West , on its treeless flat plain Regina has few topographical features other than the small spring run-off , Wascana Creek .

  "/wiki/Governor_General_of_Canada": "The Governor General of Canada ( French : Gouverneure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada [ n 1 ] ) is the federal viceregal representative of the Canadian monarch , currently Queen Elizabeth II . The person of the sovereign is shared equally both with the 15 other Commonwealth realms and the 10 provinces of Canada , but resides predominantly in her oldest and most populous realm , the United Kingdom . The Queen , on the advice of her Canadian prime minister , appoints a governor general to carry out most of her constitutional and ceremonial duties . The commission is for an unfixed period of time - known as serving at Her Majesty 's pleasure - though five years is the normal convention . Beginning in 1959 , it has also been traditional to rotate between anglophone and francophone officeholders - although many recent governors general have been bilingual . Once in office , the governor general maintains direct contact with the Queen , wherever she may be at the time . The office began in the 16th and 17th centuries with the Crown-appointed governors of the French colony of Canada followed by the British governors of Canada in the 18th and 19th centuries . Subsequently , the office is , along with the Crown , the oldest continuous institution in Canada . The present incarnation of the office emerged with Canadian Confederation and the passing of the British North America Act , 1867 , which defines the role of the governor general as carrying on the Government of Canada on behalf and in the Name of the Queen , by whatever Title he is designated . Although the post initially still represented the government of the United Kingdom ( that is , the monarch in her British council ) , the office was gradually Canadianized until , with the passage of the Statute of Westminster in 1931 and the establishment of a separate and uniquely Canadian monarchy , the governor general became the direct personal representative of the independently and uniquely Canadian sovereign , the monarch in his Canadian council . Throughout this process of gradually increasing Canadian independence , the role of governor general took on additional responsibilities . For example , in 1904 , the Militia Act granted permission for the governor general to use the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian militia , while Command-in-Chief remained vested in the sovereign , and in 1927 the first official international visit by a governor general was made .",
