  "/wiki/Jesse_James": "Jesse Woodson James ( September 5 , 1847 - April 3 , 1882 ) was an American outlaw , bank and train robber , guerrilla , and leader of the James-Younger Gang . Raised in the Little Dixie area of western Missouri , James and his family maintained strong Southern sympathies . He and his brother Frank James joined pro-Confederate guerrillas known as bushwhackers operating in Missouri and Kansas during the American Civil War . As followers of William Quantrill and Bloody Bill Anderson , they were accused of participating in atrocities against Union soldiers and civilian abolitionists , including the Centralia Massacre in 1864 . After the war , as members of various gangs of outlaws , Jesse and Frank robbed banks , stagecoaches , and trains across the Midwest , gaining national fame and often popular sympathy despite the brutality of their crimes . The James brothers were most active as members of their own gang from about 1866 until 1876 , when as a result of their attempted robbery of a bank in Northfield , Minnesota , several members of the gang were captured or killed . They continued in crime for several years afterward , recruiting new members , but came under increasing pressure from law enforcement seeking to bring them to justice . On April 3 , 1882 , Jesse James was shot and killed by Robert Ford , a new recruit to the gang who hoped to collect a reward on James ' head and a promised amnesty for his previous crimes . Already a celebrity in life , James became a legendary figure of the Wild West after his death . Despite popular portrayals of James as an embodiment of Robin Hood , robbing from the rich and giving to the poor , there is no evidence that he and his gang shared any loot from their robberies with anyone outside their close kinship network . Scholars and historians have characterized James as one of many criminals inspired by the regional insurgencies of ex-Confederates following the Civil War , rather than as a manifestation of alleged economic justice or of frontier lawlessness . James continues to be one of the most iconic figures from the era , and his life has been dramatized and memorialized numerous times .",

He began his career as a comedy writer in the 1950s , writing jokes and scripts for television and publishing several books of short humor pieces . In the early 1960s , he performed as a stand-up comedian , emphasizing monologues rather than traditional jokes , where he developed the persona of an insecure , intellectual , fretful nebbish , which he maintains is quite different from his real-life personality . In 2004 Comedy Central ranked Allen fourth on a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians , while a UK survey ranked Allen the third-greatest comedian .
