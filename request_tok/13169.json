  "/wiki/Pitcher": "In baseball , the pitcher is the player who throws the baseball from the pitcher 's mound toward the catcher to begin each play , with the goal of retiring a batter , who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the pitcher is assigned the number 1 . The pitcher is often considered the most important player on the defensive side of the game , and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum . There are many different types of pitchers , such as the starting pitcher , relief pitcher , middle reliever , lefty specialist , setup man , and the closer . Traditionally , the pitcher also bats . Starting in 1973 with the American League and spreading to further leagues throughout the 1980s and 1990s , the hitting duties of the pitcher have generally been given over to the position of designated hitter , a cause of some controversy . The National League in Major League Baseball and the Japanese Central League are among the remaining leagues that have not adopted the designated hitter position .",

  "/wiki/Catcher": "Catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player . When a batter takes his/her turn to hit , the catcher crouches behind home plate , in front of the ( home ) umpire , and receives the ball from the pitcher . In addition to this primary duty , the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well . The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket , but in cricket , wicketkeepers are increasingly known for their batting abilities . Positioned behind home plate , the catcher can see the whole field , and is therefore in the best position to direct and lead the other players in a defensive play . The catcher typically calls for pitches using hand signals . The calls are based on the pitcher 's mechanics and strengths , as well as the batter 's tendencies and weaknesses . Foul tips , bouncing balls in the dirt , and contact with runners during plays at the plate are all events to be handled by the catcher , necessitating the use of protective equipment . This includes a mask , chest and throat protectors , shin guards , and a heavily padded catcher 's mitt . Because the position requires a comprehensive understanding of the game 's strategies , the pool of former catchers yields a disproportionate number of managers in both Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball , including such prominent examples as Connie Mack , Steve O'Neill , Al L\u00f3pez , Mike Scioscia , and Joe Torre . The physical and mental demands of being involved on every defensive play can wear catchers down over a long season , and can have a negative effect on their offensive output . Because of the strategic defensive importance of catching , if a catcher has exceptional defensive skills , teams are often willing to overlook their relative offensive weaknesses .",
  "/wiki/Larry_Isbell": "Lawrence Dale Isbell ( January 8 , 1930 - October 31 , 1978 ) was an American baseball and gridiron football player . He was one of the rare players to be All-American in both baseball and in football . He was an All-American quarterback in 1951 , when he guided the Baylor Bears football team to the Orange Bowl ; he threw for 26 career touchdowns in college . In 1952 , he was named the All-American catcher by the American Baseball Coaches Association . That season , he set a school record with a .431 average ; through 2008 , he still ranked second in Baylor Bears baseball annals for best single-season average , behind Mickey Sullivan . Isbell played minor league baseball for the Boston Red Sox and Brooklyn Dodgers organizations .

  "/wiki/First_baseman": "First base , or 1B , is the first of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a baserunner to score a run for that player 's team . A first baseman is the player on the team playing defense who fields the area nearest first base , and is responsible for the majority of plays made at that base . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the first baseman is assigned the number 3 . Also called first sacker or cornerman , the first baseman is ideally a tall player who throws left-handed and possesses good flexibility and quick reflexes . Flexibility is needed because the first baseman receives throws from the other infielders , the catcher and the pitcher after they have fielded ground balls . In order for the runner to be called out , the first baseman must be able to stretch towards the throw and catch it before the runner reaches first base . First base is often referred to as the other hot corner - the hot corner being third base - and therefore , like the third baseman , he must have quick reflexes to field the hardest hit balls down the foul line , mainly by left-handed pull hitters and right-handed hitters hitting to the opposite field . They often are power hitters who have a substantial number of home runs and extra base hits while maintaining a .270 plus batting average . [ citation needed ]",

  "/wiki/Second_baseman": "In baseball and softball , second baseman is a fielding position in the infield , between second and first base . The second baseman often possesses quick hands and feet , needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly , and must be able to make the pivot on a double play . In addition , second basemen are usually right-handed ; only four left-handed throwing players have ever played second base in Major League Baseball since 1950 . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the second baseman is assigned the number 4 . Good second basemen need to have very good range since they have to field balls closer to the first baseman who is often holding runners on , or moving towards the base to cover . On a batted ball to right field , the second baseman goes out towards the ball for the relay . Due to these requirements , second base is sometimes a primarily defensive position in the modern game , but there are hitting stars as well .",
  "/wiki/USC_Trojans_baseball": "The USC Trojans baseball program represents the University of Southern California in college baseball . Established in 1888 , the team is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the Pac-12 Conference . USC home 's field is Dedeaux Field , which is named in honor of former head coach and National College Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Rod Dedeaux . The USC Trojans are one of the most successful programs in the history of college baseball . The Trojans have won more baseball national championships than any other program across all divisions of college baseball . With 12 national championships , USC is far and away the leader in that category ; no other Division I school has more than six . As of June 30 , 2018 , USC also ranked fifth in all-time College World Series ( CWS ) appearances with 21 , trailing only Texas ( 36 ) , Miami ( FL ) ( 25 ) , and Arizona State ( 22 ) , and Florida State ( 22 ) . The Trojans have won more individual CWS games ( 74 ) than any program but Texas ( 85 ) . USC also ranked fourth in all-time NCAA Tournament wins with 173 - trailing only Texas ( 240 ) , Miami ( 192 ) , and Florida State ( 192 ) - and eighth in total NCAA Tournament appearances with 37 . The Trojans have compiled an all-time record of 2,884-1,685-28 ( .630 ) - ranking fifth in all-time wins and 18th in all-time win percentage - and have captured outright or tied for 38 conference championships , as of the end of the 2018 season . USC 's most notable baseball coach was Rod Dedeaux , who coached from 1942 from 1986 and led the school to 11 of its NCAA championships , including five straight from 1970 to 1974 . The first Trojan national championship came in 1948 .",
  "/wiki/Third_baseman": "A third baseman , abbreviated 3B , is the player in baseball whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base - the third of four bases a baserunner must touch in succession to score a run . In the scoring system used to record defensive plays , the third baseman is assigned the number ' 5 ' . The third baseman requires good reflexes in reacting to batted balls , as he is often the closest infielder ( roughly 90-120 feet ) to the batter . The third base position requires a strong and accurate arm , as the third baseman often makes long throws to first base . The third baseman sometimes must throw quickly to second base in time to start a double play . The third baseman must also field fly balls in fair and foul territory . Third base is known as the hot corner , because the third baseman is relatively close to the batter and most right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball hard in this direction . A third baseman must possess good hand-eye coordination and quick reactions in order to catch hard line drives sometimes in excess of 125 miles per hour ( 201 km/h ) . Third basemen often must begin in a position even closer to the batter if a bunt is expected , creating a hazard if the ball is instead hit sharply . As with middle infielders , right-handed throwing players are standard at the position because they do not need to turn their body before throwing across the infield to first base . Mike Squires , who played fourteen games at third base in 1982 and 1983 , is a very rare example of a third baseman who threw lefty . Some third basemen have been converted from middle infielders or outfielders because the position does not require them to run as fast .",
  "/wiki/Dick_Groat": "Richard Morrow Groat ( born November 4 , 1930 ) is a former two-sport athlete best known as a shortstop in Major League Baseball . He played for four National League teams , mainly the Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals , and was named the league 's Most Valuable Player in 1960 after winning the batting title with a .325 average for the champion Pirates . From 1956 to 1962 he teamed with second baseman Bill Mazeroski to give Pittsburgh one of the game 's strongest middle infields . Groat led the NL in double plays a record five times , in putouts four times and in assists twice . At the end of his career he ranked ninth in major league history in games at shortstop ( 1,877 ) and fourth in double plays ( 1,237 ) , and was among the NL career leaders in putouts ( 10th , 3,505 ) , assists ( 8th , 5,811 ) and total chances ( 9th , 9,690 ) .

  "/wiki/Shortstop": "Shortstop , abbreviated SS , is the baseball or softball fielding position between second and third base , which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions . Historically the position was assigned to defensive specialists who were typically poor at batting and were often placed at the bottom of the batting order . Today shortstops are often able to hit well and many are placed at the top of the lineup . In the numbering system used by scorers to record defensive plays , the shortstop is assigned the number 6 . More hit balls go to the shortstop than to any other position , as there are more right-handed hitters in baseball than left-handed hitters , and most hitters have a tendency to pull the ball slightly . Like a second baseman , a shortstop must be agile , for example when performing a 4-6-3 double play . Also , like a third baseman , the shortstop fields balls hit to the left side of the infield , where a strong arm is needed to throw out a batter-runner before they reach the safety of first base .",
