About 70 miles ( 110 km ) of recreational trails , including the Wildwood Trail segment of the city 's 40-Mile Loop system , crisscross the park . As early as the 1860s , civic leaders sought to create a natural preserve in the woods near Portland . Their efforts led to the creation of a municipal park commission that in 1903 hired the Olmsted Brothers landscape architectural firm to develop a plan for Portland 's parks . Acquiring land through donations , transfers from Multnomah County , and delinquent tax foreclosures , the city eventually acted on a proposal by the City Club of Portland and combined parcels totaling about 4,000 acres ( 1,600 ha ) to create the reserve . Formally dedicated in 1948 , it ranks 19th in size among parks within U.S. cities , according to The Trust for Public Land . More than 112 bird species and 62 mammal species frequent the park and its wide variety of trees and shade-loving plants . About 40 inches ( 1,000 mm ) of rain falls on the forest each year .
