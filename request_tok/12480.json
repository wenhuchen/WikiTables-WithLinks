  "/wiki/Francis_Crick": "Francis Harry Compton Crick OM FRS ( 8 June 1916 - 28 July 2004 ) was a British molecular biologist , biophysicist , and neuroscientist . In 1953 , he co-authored with James Watson the academic paper proposing the double helix structure of the DNA molecule . Together with Watson and Maurice Wilkins , he was jointly awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material . The results were based partly on fundamental studies done by Rosalind Franklin , Raymond Gosling and Wilkins . Crick was an important theoretical molecular biologist and played a crucial role in research related to revealing the helical structure of DNA . He is widely known for the use of the term central dogma to summarize the idea that once information is transferred from nucleic acids ( DNA or RNA ) to proteins , it can not flow back to nucleic acids . In other words , the final step in the flow of information from nucleic acids to proteins is irreversible . During the remainder of his career , he held the post of J.W . Kieckhefer Distinguished Research Professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla , California . His later research centered on theoretical neurobiology and attempts to advance the scientific study of human consciousness . He remained in this post until his death ; he was editing a manuscript on his death bed , a scientist until the bitter end according to Christof Koch .",

Holley completed his PhD studies in 1947 . Following his graduate studies Holley remained associated with Cornell . He became an Assistant Professor of organic chemistry in 1948 , and was appointed as Professor of Biochemistry in 1962 . He began his research on RNA after spending a year 's sabbatical ( 1955-1956 ) studying with James F. Bonner at the California Institute of Technology . Holley 's research on RNA focused first on isolating transfer RNA ( tRNA ) , and later on determining the sequence and structure of alanine tRNA , the molecule that incorporates the amino acid alanine into proteins . Holley 's team of researchers determined the tRNA 's structure by using two ribonucleases to split the tRNA molecule into pieces . Each enzyme split the molecule at location points for specific nucleotides .",

Monod and Jacob became famous for their work on the E. coli lac operon , which encodes proteins necessary for the transport and breakdown of the sugar lactose ( lac ) . From their own work and the work of others , they came up with a model for how the levels of some proteins in a cell are controlled . In their model , the manufacture of proteins , such as the ones encoded within the lac ( lactose ) operon , is prevented when a repressor , encoded by a regulatory gene , binds to its operator , a specific site in the DNA sequence that is close to the genes encoding the proteins . ( It is now known that a repressor bound to an operator physically blocks RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter , the site where transcription of the adjacent genes begins . ) Study of the control of expression of genes in the lac operon provided the first example of a system for the regulation of transcription . Monod also suggested the existence of messenger RNA molecules that link the information encoded in DNA and proteins . For these contributions he is widely regarded as one of the founders of molecular biology .",
