It is also sometimes called the Jurchen dynasty or the Jurchen Jin , because its founding leader Aguda ( reign 1115-1123 ) was of Wanyan Jurchen descent . The Jin emerged from Taizu 's rebellion against the Liao dynasty ( 907-1125 ) , which held sway over northern China until the nascent Jin drove the Liao to the Western Regions , where they became known as the Western Liao . After vanquishing the Liao , the Jurchen Jin launched an over hundred-year struggles against the Chinese Song dynasty ( 960-1279 ) , which was based in southern China . Over the course of their rule , the Jurchens of Jin quickly adapted to Chinese customs , and even fortified the Great Wall against the rising Mongols . Domestically , the Jin oversaw a number of cultural advancements , such as the revival of Confucianism . After spending centuries as vassals of the Jin , the Mongols invaded under Genghis Khan in 1211 and inflicted catastrophic defeats on the Jin armies .

  "/wiki/Bronze_Age": "The Bronze Age is a historical period that was characterized by the use of bronze , and in some areas proto-writing , and other early features of urban civilization . The Bronze Age is the second principal period of the three-age Stone-Bronze-Iron system , as proposed in modern times by Christian J\u00fcrgensen Thomsen , for classifying and studying ancient societies . An ancient civilization is defined to be in the Bronze Age either by producing bronze by smelting its own copper and alloying with tin , arsenic , or other metals , or by trading for bronze from production areas elsewhere . Bronze itself is harder and more durable than other metals available at the time , allowing Bronze Age civilizations to gain a technological advantage . Whilst terrestrial iron is naturally abundant , its high melting point of 1,538 \u00b0C ( 2,800 \u00b0F ) placed it out of reach of common use until the end of the second millennium BC . Tin 's low melting point of 231.9 \u00b0C ( 449.4 \u00b0F ) and copper 's relatively moderate melting point of 1,085 \u00b0C ( 1,985 \u00b0F ) placed them within the capabilities of the Neolithic pottery kilns , which date back to 6000 BC and were able to produce temperatures greater than 900 \u00b0C ( 1,650 \u00b0F ) . Copper-tin ores are rare , as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in Western Asia before trading in bronze began in the third millennium BC . Worldwide , the Bronze Age generally followed the Neolithic period , with the Chalcolithic serving as a transition . Although the Iron Age generally followed the Bronze Age , in some areas ( such as Sub-Saharan Africa ) , the Iron Age began as early as 2500 BC . Bronze Age cultures differed in their development of the first writing . According to archaeological evidence , cultures in Mesopotamia ( cuneiform script ) and Egypt ( hieroglyphs ) developed the earliest viable writing systems .",

Spanning over four centuries , the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history . To this day , China 's majority ethnic group refers to themselves as the Han Chinese ( Han Zu ) and the Chinese script is referred to as Han characters . It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang , known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han , and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty ( 9-23 AD ) of the former regent Wang Mang . This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods : the Western Han or Former Han ( 206 BC - 9 AD ) and the Eastern Han or Later Han ( 25-220 AD ) . The emperor was at the pinnacle of Han society . He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class . The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government using an innovation inherited from the Qin known as commanderies , and a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms . These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence , particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States . From the reign of Emperor Wu ( r. 141-87 BC ) onward , the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics , synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu .

By the middle of the dynasty , the newly unified empire entered a golden age of prosperity with vast agricultural surplus that supported rapid population growth . A lasting legacy of the Sui dynasty was the Grand Canal . With the eastern capital Luoyang at the center of the network , it linked the west-lying capital Chang'an to the economic and agricultural centers of the east towards Hangzhou , and to the northern border near modern Beijing . While the pressing initial motives were for shipment of grains to the capital , and for transporting troops and military logistics , the reliable inland shipment links would facilitate domestic trades , flow of people and cultural exchange for centuries . Along with the extension of the Great Wall , and the construction of the eastern capital city of Luoyang , these mega projects , led by an efficient centralized bureaucracy , would amass millions of conscripted workers from the large population base , at heavy cost of human lives . After a series of costly and disastrous military campaigns against Goguryeo , one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea , ended in defeat by 614 , the dynasty disintegrated under a series of popular revolts culminating in the assassination of Emperor Yang by his ministers in 618 .",
  "/wiki/Liao_dynasty": "The Liao dynasty ( /lja\u028a/ ; Khitan : Mos J\u00e6lud ; traditional Chinese : \u907c\u671d ; simplified Chinese : \u8fbd\u671d ; pinyin : Li\u00e1o ch\u00e1o ) , also known as the Liao Empire , officially the Great Liao ( \u5927\u907c ; \u5927\u8fbd ; D\u00e0 Li\u00e1o ) , or the Khitan ( Qidan ) State ( Khitan : Mos diau-d kitai huld\u0292i gur ) , was an empire and imperial dynasty in East Asia that ruled from 916 to 1125 over present-day Northern and Northeast China , Mongolia and portions of the Russian Far East and North Korea . The empire was founded by Yel\u00fc Abaoji ( Emperor Taizu of Liao ) , Khagan of the Khitans around the time of the collapse of the Tang dynasty and was the first state to control all of Manchuria . Being ruled by the Khitan Yel\u00fc clan , the Liao dynasty is considered by historians to be a conquest dynasty of China . Almost immediately after its founding , the Liao dynasty began a process of territorial expansion , with Abaoji leading a successful conquest of Balhae . Later emperors would gain the Sixteen Prefectures by fueling a proxy war that led to the collapse of the Later Tang ( 923-936 ) and would establish tributary relationships with Goryeo after losing the Goryeo-Khitan Wars . In 1004 , the Liao dynasty launched an imperial expedition against the Northern Song dynasty . After heavy fighting and large casualties between the two empires , both sides worked out the Chanyuan Treaty . Through the treaty , the Liao dynasty forced the Northern Song to recognize them as peers and heralded an era of peace and stability between the two powers that lasted approximately 120 years . Tension between traditional Khitan social and political practices and Chinese influence and customs was a defining feature of the dynasty . This tension led to a series of succession crises ; Liao emperors favored the Chinese concept of primogeniture , while much of the rest of the Khitan elite supported the traditional method of succession by the strongest candidate . So different were Khitan and Chinese practices that Abaoji set up two parallel governments . The Northern Administration governed Khitan areas following traditional Khitan practices , while the Southern Administration governed areas with large non-Khitan populations , adopting traditional Chinese governmental practices .",

It followed the Song dynasty and preceded the Ming dynasty . Although the Mongols had ruled territories including modern-day North China for decades , it was not until 1271 that Kublai Khan officially proclaimed the dynasty in the traditional Chinese style , and the conquest was not complete until 1279 when the Southern Song dynasty was defeated in the Battle of Yamen . His realm was , by this point , isolated from the other Mongol khanates and controlled most of modern-day China and its surrounding areas , including modern Mongolia . It was the first non-Han Chinese dynasty to rule all of China and lasted until 1368 when the Ming dynasty defeated the Yuan forces . Following that , the rebuked Genghisid rulers retreated to their Mongolian homeland and continued to rule as the Northern Yuan dynasty . Some of the Mongolian Emperors of the Yuan mastered the Chinese language , while others only used their native language ( i.e . Mongolian ) and the 'Phags-pa script . The Yuan dynasty was the khanate ruled by the successors of M\u00f6ngke Khan after the division of the Mongol Empire . In official Chinese histories , the Yuan dynasty bore the Mandate of Heaven . The dynasty was established by Kublai Khan , yet he placed his grandfather Genghis Khan on the imperial records as the official founder of the dynasty as Taizu . [ note 3 ] In the Proclamation of the Dynastic Name , Kublai announced the name of the new dynasty as Great Yuan and claimed the succession of former Chinese dynasties from the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors to the Tang dynasty .",
