  "/wiki/House_show": "A house show or live event is a professional wrestling event produced by a major promotion that is not televised , though they can be recorded . Promotions use house shows mainly to cash in on the exposure that they and their wrestlers receive during televised events , as well as to test reactions to matches , wrestlers , and gimmicks that are being considered for the main televised programming and upcoming pay-per-views . House shows are similar to dark matches - an untelevised match that occurs as part of an event that was already being televised . House shows are also often designed to make the face wrestlers to win most matches , largely to send the crowd home happy . Though , if a heel defends a title , the face may win by disqualification if this is the case ."
