  "/wiki/Cash_crop": "A cash crop or profit crop is an agricultural crop which is grown to sell for profit . It is typically purchased by parties separate from a farm . The term is used to differentiate marketed crops from subsistence crops , which are those fed to the producer 's own livestock or grown as food for the producer 's family . In earlier times cash crops were usually only a small ( but vital ) part of a farm 's total yield , while today , especially in developed countries , almost all crops are mainly grown for revenue . In the least developed countries , cash crops are usually crops which attract demand in more developed nations , and hence have some export value . Prices for major cash crops are set in commodity markets with global scope , with some local variation ( termed as basis ) based on freight costs and local supply and demand balance . A consequence of this is that a nation , region , or individual producer relying on such a crop may suffer low prices should a bumper crop elsewhere lead to excess supply on the global markets . This system has been criticized by traditional farmers . Coffee is an example of a product that has been susceptible to significant commodity futures price variations .",

  "/wiki/Round_barn": "A round barn is a historic barn design that could be octagonal , polygonal , or circular in plan . Though round barns were not as popular as some other barn designs , their unique shape makes them noticeable . The years from 1880-1920 represent the height of round barn construction . Round barn construction in the United States can be divided into two overlapping eras . The first , the octagonal era , spanned from 1850-1900 . The second , the true circular era , spanned from 1889-1936 . The overlap meant that round barns of both types , polygonal and circular , were built during the latter part of the nineteenth century . Numerous round barns in the United States are listed on the National Register of Historic Places .",
  "/wiki/Swedish_American": "Swedish Americans ( Swedish : Svenskamerikaner ) are Americans of at least partial Swedish ancestry . They primarily include the 1.2 million Swedish immigrants during 1885-1915 and their descendants . They formed tight-knit communities , primarily in the American Midwest , and intermarried with other Swedish-Americans . Most were Lutheran Christians with origins in the state Church of Sweden who were affiliated with predecessor bodies of what are now the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America ( ELCA ) from the mergers of 1988 or the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod ( 1847 ) , or the recent North American Lutheran Church ( NALC ) of 2010 ; some were Methodists following Wesleyan doctrine . Today , Swedish Americans are found throughout the United States , with Minnesota , California and Illinois being the top three states with the highest number of Swedish Americans .

  "/wiki/Colonial_Revival_architecture": "The Colonial Revival architectural style seeks to revive elements of American colonial architecture . The beginnings of the Colonial Revival style are often attributed to the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 , which reawakened Americans to the architectural traditions of their colonial past . Fairly small numbers of Colonial Revival homes were built c. 1880-1910 , a period when Queen Anne-style architecture was dominant in the United States . From 1910-1930 , the Colonial Revival movement was ascendant , with about 40% of U.S. homes built during this period in the Colonial Revival style . In the immediate post-war period ( c. 1950s-early 1960s ) , Colonial Revival homes continued to be constructed , but in simplified form . In the present-day , many New Traditional homes draw from Colonial Revival styles . While the dominant influences in Colonial Revival style are Georgian and Federal architecture , Colonial Revival homes also draw , to a lesser extent , from the Dutch Colonial style and post-medieval English styles . Colonial Revival homes are often eclectic in style , freely combining aspects from several of these prototypes . Although associated with the architectural movement , Colonial Revival also refers to historic preservation , landscape architecture and garden design , and decorative arts movements that emulate or draw inspiration from colonial forms . Cyril M. Harris 's American Architecture : An Illustrated Encyclopedia noted that Colonial Revival houses are usually the result of a rather free interpretation of their prototypes ; they tend to be larger , may differ significantly from the houses they seek to emulate , and often exaggerate architectural details .",
  "/wiki/St._John's_Lutheran_Church_(Isanti,_Minnesota)": "Historic St. John 's Lutheran Church ( German Evangelical Lutheran Church ) is an historic church in Bradford Township , Minnesota , United States . The church was built by German immigrants , who were among the earliest settlers in Isanti County , Minnesota . German settlers in the southeastern portion of Bradford Township wanted their own church with services in their native language . Church services were held in members ' homes until the church was formally organized in 1882 and a building was built on donated land . The building is one story high , built in the Greek Revival style , with white clapboard siding on the exterior . The interior was heated with a simple wood stove at the back of the church , and lit with kerosene lamps and Coleman Quick-Lite chandeliers . It also did not have running water or inside bathrooms . The chancel and pulpit were donated by a church in Osseo , Minnesota , that was doing its own renovations . The community never had a congregation large enough to justify having a full-time pastor . The church relied on lay people to do readings , as well as sharing a pastor with St. John 's of Weber , Minnesota . Pastor F.J. Mack , who served from 1924 through 1945 , began offering services in English and stopped offering services in German . In 1959 , the congregation decided to merge with St. John 's of Weber after facing declining membership .",

With an estimated size of approximately 44 million in 2016 , German Americans are the largest of the self-reported ancestry groups by the US Census Bureau in its American Community Survey . German-Americans account for about one third of the total ethnic German population in the world . None of the German states had American colonies . In the 1670s , the first significant groups of German immigrants arrived in the British colonies , settling primarily in Pennsylvania , New York , and Virginia . Immigration continued in very large numbers during the 19th century , with eight million arrivals from Germany . Between 1820 and 1870 more than seven and a half million German immigrants came to the United States . By 2010 , their population grew to 49.8 million German Americans , reflecting a jump of six million people since 2000 . There is a German belt that extends all the way across the United States , from eastern Pennsylvania to the Oregon coast . Pennsylvania has the largest population of German-Americans in the U.S. and is home to one of the group 's original settlements , Germantown ( Philadelphia ) , founded in 1683 and the birthplace of the American antislavery movement in 1688 , as well as the revolutionary Battle of Germantown . The state of Pennsylvania has 3.5 million people of German ancestry .

  "/wiki/Reformed": "Calvinism ( also called the Reformed tradition , Reformed Christianity , Reformed Protestantism , or the Reformed faith ) is a major branch of Protestantism that follows the theological tradition and forms of Christian practice set down by John Calvin and other Reformation-era theologians . Calvinists broke from the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century . Calvinists differ from Lutherans on the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist , theories of worship , and the use of God 's law for believers , among other things . The term Calvinism can be misleading , because the religious tradition which it denotes has always been diverse , with a wide range of influences rather than a single founder ; however almost all of them drew heavily from the writings of Augustine of Hippo a millennium prior . In the context of the Reformation , Huldrych Zwingli began the Reformed tradition in 1519 in the city of Z\u00fcrich . His followers were instantly labeled Zwinglians , consistent with the Catholic practice of naming heresy after its founder . Very soon , Zwingli was joined by Martin Bucer , Wolfgang Capito , William Farel , Johannes Oecolampadius and other early Reformed thinkers . The namesake of the movement , French reformer John Calvin , renounced Roman Catholicism and embraced Protestant views in the late 1520s or early 1530s , as the earliest notions of later Reformed tradition were already espoused by Huldrych Zwingli . The movement was first called Calvinism , referring to John Calvin , by Lutherans who opposed it . Many within the tradition find it either an indescriptive or an inappropriate term and would prefer the word Reformed to be used instead . The most important Reformed theologians include Calvin , Zwingli , Martin Bucer , William Farel , Heinrich Bullinger , Peter Martyr Vermigli , Theodore Beza , and John Knox .

  "/wiki/One-room_school": "One-room schools were commonplace throughout rural portions of various countries , including Prussia , Norway , Sweden , the United States , Canada , Australia , New Zealand , the United Kingdom , Ireland , and Spain . In most rural and small town schools , all of the students met in a single room . There , a single teacher taught academic basics to several grade levels of elementary-age children . While in many areas one-room schools are no longer used , it is not uncommon for them to remain in developing nations and rural or remote areas . Examples include remote parts of the American West , the Falklands , and the Shetland Islands ."
