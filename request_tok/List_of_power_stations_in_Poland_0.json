With a population of approximately 128,137 ( December 2018 ) , it is the capital of Opole Voivodeship and the seat of Opole County . With its long history dating back to the 8th century , Opole is one of the oldest cities in Poland . It is also the smallest city in Poland to be the largest city in a voivodeship . The origins of the first settlement are connected with the town being granted Magdeburg Rights in 1217 by Casimir I of Opole , the great-grandson of Polish Duke Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth . During the Medieval Period and the Renaissance the city was known as a centre of commerce due to its position on the intersection of several main trade routes , which helped to generate steady profits from transit trade . The rapid development of the town was also caused by the establishment of a seat of regency in Opole in 1816 . The first railway connection between Oppeln , Brieg and Breslau was opened in 1843 and the first manufacturing plants were constructed in 1859 , which greatly contributed to the city 's regional significance . The city 's extensive heritage entails almost all cultures of Central Europe including years of Polish , Bohemian , Prussian and German rule . Opole formally became part of Poland again in 1945 under the Potsdam Agreement . Many German Upper Silesians and Poles of German ancestry still reside in the Opole region ; in the city itself , however , ethnic Germans today make up less than 3% of the population following the 1945-6 expulsions . Today there are four higher education establishments in the city : The Opole University , Opole University of Technology , a Medical College and the private Higher College of Management and Administration .",
