Bengal was the economic , cultural and educational hub of the British Raj . During the period of proto-industrialization , Bengal made direct significant contributions to the Industrial revolution in Britain , although it was soon undertaken by the Kingdom of Mysore ruled by Tipu Sultan as South Asia 's dominant economic power . It was the centre of the late 19th and early 20th century Bengali Renaissance and a hotbed of the Indian Independence Movement .

The islands provided the British with a sheltered harbour for trade , in addition to a relatively sequestered location that reduced the chances of land-based attacks . Over the next two centuries , the British dominated the region , first securing the archipelago from the Portuguese , and later defeating the Marathas to secure the hinterland . Bombay Presidency was one of the three Presidencies of British India ; the other two being Madras Presidency , and Bengal Presidency . It was in the centre-west of the Indian subcontinent on the Arabian Sea . It was bordered to the north-west , north , and north-east by Baluchistan , the British province of Punjab , and the Princely state of Rajputana ; to the east by the Princely states of Central India Agency , the Central Provinces , Berar and Hyderabad ; and to the south by Madras Presidency and Mysore State .

Various portions of Burmese territories , including Arakan ( Rakhine State ) or Tenasserim were annexed by the British after their victory in the First Anglo-Burmese War ; Lower Burma was annexed in 1852 after the Second Anglo-Burmese War .
