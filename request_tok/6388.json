It was founded by Marcus Morris , an Anglican vicar from Lancashire . Morris edited a Southport parish magazine called The Anvil , but felt that the church was not communicating its message effectively . Simultaneously disillusioned with contemporary children 's literature , he and Anvil artist Frank Hampson created a dummy comic based on Christian values . Morris proposed the idea to several Fleet Street publishers , with little success , until Hulton Press took it on . Following a huge publicity campaign , the first issue of Eagle was released in April 1950 . Revolutionary in its presentation and content , it was enormously successful ; the first issue sold about 900,000 copies . Featured in colour on the front cover was its most recognisable story , Dan Dare , Pilot of the Future , created by Hampson with meticulous attention to detail .

  "/wiki/Wham!_(comics)": "Wham ! was a weekly British comic book magazine published by Odhams Press . It ran for 187 issues from 20 June 1964 to 13 January 1968 , when it merged into its sister title Pow ! . Although Wham ! was superficially a typical British comic in the mould of The Beano , its later issues ( under the Power Comics imprint ) included short instalments of The Fantastic Four reprinted from American Marvel Comics . The initial success of Wham ! prompted the creation of sister titles Pow ! and Smash ! with similar intent , and led to the formation of the Power Comics line . But as costs rose in 1968 , the inevitable adjustment of content , followed by mergers of titles , made the Power Comics more like those they were attempting to replace . Created by Leo Baxendale , in its early issues Wham ! presented both clear imitations of Beano strips , such as a clone of his Bash Street Kids in the shape of The Tiddlers , and new original strips such as Eagle Eye , Junior Spy and Georgie 's Germs in which he attempted to break the mould of older strips by the use of bizarre humour , outrageous puns , and surreal plots .",
  "/wiki/Smash!_(comics)": "Smash ! was a weekly British comic book , published in London by Odhams Press Ltd from 64 Long Acre and subsequently by IPC Magazines Ltd from ( initially ) 189 High Holborn and ( latterly ) Fleetway House in nearby Farringdon Street . It ran for 257 issues , between 5 February 1966 and 3 April 1971 ( although , due to strikes and industrial disputes , publication was not continuous during that period ) . It then merged into Valiant . But the Smash ! Annual , published mainly under the Fleetway imprint , continued to appear every year : the final Annual , cover-dated 1976 , was published in the autumn of 1975 . During 1967 and 1968 Smash ! was part of Odhams ' Power Comics line ( from # 44 to # 143 ) , absorbing its sister titles Pow ! on 14 September 1968 ( issue 137 ) and Fantastic on 2 November 1968 ( issue 144 ) .

Part of their Power Comics imprint , it was printed on newsprint stock , in black-and-white except for its colour front and back covers , and initially comprised 28 pages .

The 89th and final issue of Fantastic appeared on 7 September 1968 , after which it was merged into Smash ! . Fantastic was different from the earlier Power Comics such as Smash ! and Pow ! , which were essentially traditional Beano-style British comic papers supplemented by a small amount of material reprinted from Marvel Comics . In contrast , Fantastic ( and later Terrific as well ) were more American in appearance , resembling the black-and-white comic anthologies of the time such as Creepy and Eerie . However , they were aimed at a younger audience than such magazines ( although an older audience than the Beano-style British fare ) .",
  "/wiki/Terrific_(comics)": "Terrific was a weekly British comic published by Odhams Press under the Power Comics imprint . It ran for 43 issues from 15 April 1967 until 3 February 1968 , when it was merged with its sister title Fantastic . Terrific was very similar in format to Fantastic , which had started publication two months earlier . The two titles were quite unlike other British comics of the time , consisting mainly of material reprinted from American Marvel Comics . In this respect they can be considered a precursor of the Marvel UK weeklies , such as The Mighty World of Marvel , that appeared during the 1970s . The Marvel titles which were reprinted in Terrific included The Avengers , the Doctor Strange strips from Strange Tales , and the Sub-Mariner and Giant-Man strips from Tales to Astonish .",
  "/wiki/Action_(comics)": "Action is a controversial weekly British anthology comic that was published by IPC Magazines , starting on 14 February 1976 .

It reappeared the following month , in toned-down form , and continued publication until 12 November 1977 , at which point it was merged with Battle Picture Weekly .

As a comics anthology it serialises stories in each issue ( known as progs ) [ note 1 ] and was first published by IPC Magazines in 1977 , the first issue dated 26 February .

Other characters in 2000 AD include Rogue Trooper , Strontium Dog and the ABC Warriors .",
  "/wiki/Starlord_(comics)": "Starlord was a short-lived weekly British science fiction comic book magazine published by IPC in 1978 as a sister title to 2000 AD , which had been launched the previous year in anticipation of a science fiction boom surrounding Star Wars . Starlord was planned as a fortnightly title for older readers , with longer stories and higher production values than 2000 AD and the rest of the IPC boys ' comics stable , but this proved too ambitious . Episodes were shortened , the number of colour pages was reduced , although the better quality paper and printing were retained , and Starlord was published weekly at a higher cover price than 2000 AD .",
  "/wiki/Tornado_(comics)": "Tornado was a short-lived weekly British comic magazine published for 22 issues by IPC Magazines between March 1979 and August 1979 . After the cancellations of the Starlord and Action titles , IPC launched Tornado as a way to use up stories already commissioned for the other titles . Like Action it was a mixed title featuring war , detective , horror and science fiction stories . Its first editor was Kelvin Gosnell , who was followed by Dave Hunt . Tornado was printed on the low quality newsprint stock used by 2000 AD and also had five stories of four to six pages per issue . The title also had a 'superpowered ' editor , like Tharg , 'Big E ' who was portrayed in photo-strips by a rather portly Dave Gibbons .",

It was edited by Dez Skinn and published by his company Quality Communications . It featured early work by comics writer Alan Moore , including V for Vendetta and Marvelman .

Rivalling 2000 AD , Warrior won 17 Eagle Awards during its short run ( including nine Eagles in 1983 alone ) . Because of traditional distribution and its format , it was one of the comic books in the British market that did n't just rely upon distribution through then format-driven specialist shops and expensive subscriptions for its sales base .",
  "/wiki/Scream!_(comics)": "Scream ! was a British weekly horror comic anthology that was published for 15 issues by IPC Magazines in 1984 . Controversy over horror comics had led to the introduction of the Children and Young Persons ( Harmful Publications ) Act 1955 , under which the first prosecution occurred in 1970 . The editorial approach to Scream ! was to de-emphasise the horror label and deliberately not repeat the style of its more controversial precursors , making it more tongue-in-cheek for younger readers , as evidenced by its coverline not for the nervous .",
  "/wiki/Oink!_(comics)": "Oink ! was a British comic book magazine for children which was published from 3 May 1986 to 22 October 1988 . It set out to be deliberately anarchic , reminiscent of Viz but for children . The creators also cited Mad magazine as a major influence . Part of its difference in the marketplace was that it attracted writers and cartoonists from a wide range of previous disciplines . It was devised , launched and edited by Patrick Gallagher , Private Eye regular contributor Tony Husband and Mark Rodgers , although within the fiction of the comic it was edited by a character called Uncle Pigg ( similar to 2000 AD 's Tharg the Mighty ) . The comic also followed 2000 AD 's lead in crediting its contributors for their work , still a rarity in British comics at that time . Featured artists and writers included Husband 's Private Eye colleague David Haldane , ex-The Fall member and future BBC Radio 1 radio host Marc Lard Riley , Malcolm Douglas , Brickman creator Lew Stringer , future Beano writer/artist Kev F Sutherland , future Marvel artist , writer and editor & current SpongeBob SquarePants Magazine editor David Leach , future Financial Times cartoonist Jeremy Banks , and satirical media commentator-to-be Charlie Brooker . Viz founders Davy Thorp and Chris Donald also contributed some one-off strips , as did The Beano 's Tom Paterson and John Geering . Oink ! proved somewhat controversial , with various conservative groups and a chain of newsagents branding it offensive and unsuitable for children . A notably controversial item was the story Janice and John and the Parachute Jump , a parody of the Janet and John readers which appeared in issue 7 , which prompted an official complaint to the Press Council ."
