  "/wiki/Acre": "The acre is a unit of land area used in the imperial and US customary systems . It is traditionally defined as the area of one chain by one furlong ( 66 by 660 feet ) , which is exactly equal to 10 square chains , \u200b1\u2044640 of a square mile , or 43,560 square feet , and approximately 4,047 m2 , or about 40% of a hectare . Based upon the International yard and pound agreement of 1959 , an acre may be declared as exactly 4,046.8564224 square metres . An internationally recognised symbol for the acre is ac . The acre is a statute measure in the United States , in the United Kingdom and in almost all countries of the former British Empire : in most it is lawful to 'use for trade ' if given as supplementary information and is not used for land registration . In the United States both the international acre and the US survey acre are in use , but they differ by only two parts per million : see below . The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land . Traditionally , in the Middle Ages , an acre was defined as the area of land that could be ploughed in one day by a yoke of oxen .",
  "/wiki/Hectare": "The hectare ( /\u02c8h\u025bkt\u025b\u0259r , -t\u0251\u02d0r/ ; SI symbol : ha ) is a non-SI metric unit of area equal to a square with 100-metre sides ( 1 hm2 ) , or 10,000 m2 , and is primarily used in the measurement of land . There are 100 hectares in one square kilometre . An acre is about 0.405 hectare and one hectare contains about 2.47 acres . In 1795 , when the metric system was introduced , the are was defined as 100 square metres and the hectare ( hecto- + are ) was thus 100 ares or \u200b1\u2044100 km2 ( 10,000 square metres ) . When the metric system was further rationalised in 1960 , resulting in the International System of Units ( SI ) , the are was not included as a recognised unit . The hectare , however , remains as a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI and whose use is expected to continue indefinitely . Though the dekare/decare daa ( 1,000 m2 ) and are a ( 100 m2 ) are not officially accepted for use , they are still used in some contexts .",
