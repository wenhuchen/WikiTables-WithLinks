  "/wiki/Land_speculator": "Speculation is the purchase of an asset ( a commodity , goods , or real estate ) with the hope that it will become more valuable in the near future . In finance , speculation is also the practice of engaging in risky financial transactions in an attempt to profit from short term fluctuations in the market value of a tradable financial instrument - rather than attempting to profit from the underlying financial attributes embodied in the instrument such as capital gains , dividends , or interest . Many speculators pay little attention to the fundamental value of a security and instead focus purely on price movements . Speculation can in principle involve any tradable good or financial instrument . Speculators are particularly common in the markets for stocks , bonds , commodity futures , currencies , fine art , collectibles , real estate , and derivatives . Speculators play one of four primary roles in financial markets , along with hedgers , who engage in transactions to offset some other pre-existing risk , arbitrageurs who seek to profit from situations where fungible instruments trade at different prices in different market segments , and investors who seek profit through long-term ownership of an instrument 's underlying attributes .",

  "/wiki/Queen_Anne_style_architecture_in_the_United_States": "In the United States , Queen Anne-style architecture was popular from roughly 1880 to 1910 . Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles . The style bears almost no relationship to the Queen Anne style architecture , a toned-down version of English Baroque mostly used for gentry houses , produced in the actual reign of Queen Anne from 1702 to 1714 . It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s .",

The movement is generally considered part of the late Victorian period in terms of broad antique furniture designations . In architecture the Eastlake Style or Eastlake architecture is part of the Queen Anne style of Victorian architecture . Eastlake 's book Hints on Household Taste in Furniture , Upholstery , and Other Details posited that furniture and decor in people 's homes should be made by hand or machine workers who took personal pride in their work . Manufacturers in the United States used the drawings and ideas in the book to create mass-produced Eastlake Style or Cottage furniture . The geometric ornaments , spindles , low relief carvings , and incised lines were designed to be affordable and easy to clean ; nevertheless , many of the designs which resulted are artistically complex .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",
  "/wiki/Akron_Plan": "The Akron Plan was a scheme for the design of churches and other religious buildings that housed Sunday schools . It was characterized by a set of wedge-shaped classrooms that radiated from the direction of a central superintendent 's platform . Doors or movable partitions could be closed to separate the classes , or opened to allow the entire body of pupils to participate in school-wide exercises . Until about 1860 , Sunday-school pupils of all ages were taught together in a single large room . After that , there was an increasing tendency for pupils to be taught separately , with instruction tailored to their ages , for most of the session . However , the superintendent conducted all-school exercises at the beginning and end of the session . To facilitate this , the building 's interior layout had to enable the students to be quickly and efficiently divided into classes or brought together in a single body . The Akron Plan was devised to address this need . It took its name from the city of Akron in the state of Ohio in the Great Lakes region of the United States , where it was developed for the construction of a church built in 1866-67 . It was quickly adopted by Protestant churches across the United States . The plan fell out of favor in the early 20th century , when Sunday schools changed their approach to one in which pupils were taught separately for the entire session , eliminating the school-wide exercises . The awkwardly shaped and imperfectly soundproofed rooms were poorly adapted for this new approach , and many of them underwent extensive remodelling .",

  "/wiki/Beer": "Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drinks in the world . It is also the third most popular drink overall after water and tea . Beer is brewed from cereal grains - most commonly from malted barley , though wheat , maize ( corn ) , and rice are also used . During the brewing process , fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer . Most modern beer is brewed with hops , which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent . Other flavouring agents such as gruit , herbs , or fruits may be included or used instead of hops . In commercial brewing , the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation . Some of humanity 's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer : the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours , and The Hymn to Ninkasi , a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer , served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people . Beer is distributed in bottles and cans and is also commonly available on draught , particularly in pubs and bars . The brewing industry is a global business , consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries . The strength of modern beer is usually around 4% to 6% alcohol by volume ( ABV ) , although it may vary between 0.5% and 20% , with some breweries creating examples of 40% ABV and above . Beer forms part of the culture of many nations and is associated with social traditions such as beer festivals , as well as a rich pub culture involving activities like pub crawling and pub games .",
  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",

A Republican lawyer from New England , born in Vermont , Coolidge worked his way up the ladder of Massachusetts state politics , eventually becoming governor of Massachusetts . His response to the Boston Police Strike of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight and gave him a reputation as a man of decisive action . The next year , he was elected vice president of the United States , and he succeeded to the presidency upon the sudden death of Warren G. Harding in 1923 . Elected in his own right in 1924 , he gained a reputation as a small government conservative and also as a man who said very little and had a rather dry sense of humor . Coolidge restored public confidence in the White House after the scandals of his predecessor 's administration , and left office with considerable popularity . As a Coolidge biographer wrote : He embodied the spirit and hopes of the middle class , could interpret their longings and express their opinions . That he did represent the genius of the average is the most convincing proof of his strength . Scholars have ranked Coolidge in the lower half of those presidents that they have assessed .

  "/wiki/Silent_film": "A silent film is a film with no synchronized recorded sound ( and in particular , no audible dialogue ) . In silent films for entertainment , the plot may be conveyed by the use of title cards , written indications of the plot and key dialogue lines . The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself , but because of the technical challenges involved , the introduction of synchronized dialogue became practical only in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the advent of the Vitaphone system . The term silent film is something of a misnomer , as these films were almost always accompanied by live sounds . During the silent era that existed from the mid-1890s to the late 1920s , a pianist , theater organist - or even , in large cities , a small orchestra - would often play music to accompany the films . Pianists and organists would play either from sheet music , or improvisation . Sometimes a person would even narrate the intertitle cards for the audience . Though at the time the technology to synchronize sound with the video did not exist , music was seen as an essential part of the viewing experience . The term is also frequently used to describe sound-era films that have a recorded music-only soundtrack without dialogue , such as City Lights and The Artist . The term silent film is a retronym - a term created to retroactively distinguish something . Early sound films , starting with The Jazz Singer in 1927 , were variously referred to as the talkies , sound films , or talking pictures . Within a decade , the widespread production of silent films for popular entertainment had ceased , and the industry had moved fully into the sound era , in which movies were accompanied by synchronized sound recordings of spoken dialogue , music and sound effects .",
