The Primetime Emmy Awards generally air in mid-September , on the Sunday before the official start of the fall television season . They are currently seen in rotation among the four major networks ( ABC , CBS , FOX , NBC ) . The ceremony is typically moved to late-August if it is broadcast by NBC ( such as in 2006 , 2010 , and 2014 ) , so that it does not conflict with NBC 's commitment to broadcasting Sunday-night NFL games ( due to another conflict , this time with the MTV Video Music Awards , the 2014 ceremony was also shifted to a Monday ) . However , the 2018 ceremony , broadcast by NBC , was moved back to September and aired on a Monday .

After he and his family narrowly manage to escape , they ultimately abandon Homer for his selfishness , and he works to redeem his folly by stopping Russ Cargill , the head of the EPA , from destroying Springfield . Although previous attempts to create a Simpsons film had been made , they all failed due to the lack of a script of appropriate length and production crew members . Eventually in 2001 , producers James L. Brooks , Matt Groening , Al Jean , Richard Sakai and Mike Scully began development of the film and a writing team consisting of Brooks , Groening , Jean , Scully , Ian Maxtone-Graham , George Meyer , David Mirkin , Mike Reiss , Matt Selman , John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti was assembled . They conceived numerous plot ideas , with Groening 's being the one developed into a film . The script was rewritten over a hundred times , with rewrites continuing after work on the animation began in 2006 . Consequently , hours of finished material was cut from the final release , including cameo roles from Erin Brockovich , Minnie Driver , Isla Fisher , Kelsey Grammer and Edward Norton . Tom Hanks and the members of Green Day voice their own animated counterparts in the final cut of the film , while Albert Brooks , a frequent guest performer on the series , provides the voice of the villain Cargill . Tie-in promotions were made with several companies to promote the film 's release , including Burger King and 7-Eleven , the latter of which transformed selected stores into Kwik-E-Marts . The film premiered in Springfield , Vermont on July 21 , 2007 and was released theatrically six days later by 20th Century Fox across the United States ."
