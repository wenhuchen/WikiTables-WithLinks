  "/wiki/Taoism": "Daoism ( /\u02c8da\u028a\u026az\u0259m/ , /\u02c8da\u028a-/ ) , or Taoism ( /\u02c8ta\u028a-/ ) , is a philosophical or religious tradition of Chinese origin which emphasises living in harmony with the Dao ( Chinese : \u9053 ; pinyin : D\u00e0o ; literally : 'the Way ' , also romanized as Tao ) . The Dao is a fundamental idea in most Chinese philosophical schools ; in Daoism , however , it denotes the principle that is the source , pattern and substance of everything that exists . Daoism differs from Confucianism by not emphasising rigid rituals and social order , but is similar in the sense that it is a teaching about the various disciplines for achieving perfection by becoming one with the unplanned rhythms of the universe called the way or dao . Daoist ethics vary depending on the particular school , but in general tend to emphasise wu wei ( action without intention ) , naturalness , simplicity , spontaneity , and the Three Treasures : \u6148 compassion , \u5109 frugality , and \u4e0d\u6562\u70ba\u5929\u4e0b\u5148 humility . The roots of Daoism go back at least to the 4th century BCE . Early Daoism drew its cosmological notions from the School of Yinyang ( Naturalists ) , and was deeply influenced by one of the oldest texts of Chinese culture , the I Ching ( Yi Jing ) , which expounds a philosophical system about how to keep human behavior in accordance with the alternating cycles of nature . The Legalist Shen Buhai ( c. 400 - c. 337 BCE ) may also have been a major influence , expounding a realpolitik of wu wei . The Dao De Jing , a compact book containing teachings attributed to Laozi ( \u8001\u5b50 ; L\u01ceoz\u01d0 ; Lao\u00b3 Tz\u016d\u00b3 ) , is widely considered the keystone work of the Daoist tradition , together with the later writings of Zhuangzi . Daoism has had a profound influence on Chinese culture in the course of the centuries , and Daoists ( \u9053\u58eb ; d\u00e0oshi , masters of the Dao ) , a title traditionally attributed only to the clergy and not to their lay followers , usually take care to note distinction between their ritual tradition and the practices of Chinese folk religion and non-Taoist vernacular ritual orders , which are often mistakenly identified as pertaining to Daoism . Chinese alchemy ( especially neidan ) , Chinese astrology , Chan ( Zen ) Buddhism , several martial arts , traditional Chinese medicine , feng shui , and many styles of qigong have been intertwined with Daoism throughout history . Beyond China , Taoism also had influence on surrounding societies in Asia . Today , the Daoist tradition is one of the five religious doctrines officially recognised in the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) as well as the Republic of China ( ROC ) , and although it does not travel readily from its East Asian roots , [ citation needed ] it claims adherents in a number of societies , in particular in Hong Kong , Macau , and in Southeast Asia .",
  "/wiki/Amulet": "An amulet , also known as a good luck charm , is an object believed to confer protection upon its possessor . The word amulet comes from the Latin word amuletum , which Pliny 's Natural History describes as an object that protects a person from trouble . Anything can function as an amulet ; items commonly so used include gems , statues , coins , drawings , plant parts , animal parts , and written words . Amulets which are said to derive their extraordinary properties and powers from magic or those which impart luck are typically part of folk religion or paganism , whereas amulets or sacred objects of formalised mainstream religion as in Christianity are believed to have no power of their own without being blessed by a clergyman , and they supposedly will also not provide any preternatural benefit to the bearer who does not have an appropriate disposition . Talismans and charms may differ from amulets by having alleged magical powers other than protection . Amulets are sometimes confused with pendants , small aesthetic objects that hang from necklaces . Any given pendant may indeed be an amulet but so may any other object that purportedly protects its holder from danger .",

They enabled Mongol nobles and officials to demand goods and services from civilian populations . Although only someone with a paiza was required to be supplied with mounts and served specified rations , those carrying military rarities used the yam even without a paiza . The officials and nobles of the Mongol Empire issued paizas unofficially and abused civilians . Therefore , \u00d6gedei Khan ( r. 1229-1241 ) prohibited the nobility from issuing paizas and jarliqs . To attract foreign or overseas merchants and talents , the Great Khans gave them paiza exempting them from taxes and allowing them to use relay stations . Most of these merchants were business partners of the Mongols , known as ortoq . However , M\u00f6ngke Khan ( r. 1251-1259 ) limited notorious abuses and sent imperial investigators to supervise the business of the merchants who were sponsored by the Mongols . He prohibited them from using the imperial relay stations or yam ( zam ) and paizas . Marco Polo , who visited the Yuan Dynasty during the reign of Kublai Khan ( r. 1260-1294 ) , left a good description of the paiza . The Ilkhan Ghazan ( r. 1295-1304 ) reformed the issuance of jarliqs , creating set forms and graded seals , ordering that all jarliqs be kept on file at court and canceling jarliqs older than 30 years and old paizas . He fashioned new paizas into two ranks , ordered that they bear the names of the bearers on them to prevent them from being transferred and required them to be relinquished at the end of the official 's term .",
