  "/wiki/Chesapeake_and_Ohio_Railway": "The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway ( reporting marks C & O , CO ) was a Class I railroad formed in 1869 in Virginia from several smaller Virginia railroads begun in the 19th century . Led by industrialist Collis P. Huntington , it reached from Virginia 's capital city of Richmond to the Ohio River by 1873 , where the railroad town ( and later city ) of Huntington , West Virginia , was named for him . Tapping the coal reserves of West Virginia , the C & O 's Peninsula Extension to new coal piers on the harbor of Hampton Roads resulted in the creation of the new City of Newport News . Coal revenues also led the forging of a rail link to the Midwest , eventually reaching Columbus , Cincinnati and Toledo in Ohio and Chicago , Illinois . By the early 1960s the C & O was headquartered in Cleveland , Ohio , USA . In 1972 , under the leadership of Cyrus Eaton , it became part of the Chessie System , along with the Baltimore and Ohio and Western Maryland Railway . The Chessie System was later combined with the Seaboard Coast Line and Louisville and Nashville , both the primary components of the Family Lines System , to become a key portion of CSX Transportation ( CSXT ) in the 1980s . C & O 's passenger services ended in 1971 with the formation of Amtrak . Today Amtrak 's tri-weekly Cardinal passenger train follows the historic and scenic route of the C & O through the New River Gorge in one of the more rugged sections of the Mountain State .
