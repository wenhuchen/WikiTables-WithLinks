Al-Fawwaz appeared on the UN 1267 Committee 's list of individuals belonging to or associated with al-Qaeda , and was embargoed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the US Treasury 's Office of Foreign Assets Control . According to the Treasury statement , al-Fawwaz was born on August 25 , 1962 . He moved to London in 1994 . He was appointed by Osama bin Laden as the first head of the media organ called the Advice and Reform Committee in London , where he met Adel Abdel Bari and Abu Qatada , amongst others . In 1995 , while bin Laden was in Sudan , al-Fawwaz was said to be attempting to pave the way for bin Laden to move to Britain . He was arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989 , as part of Operation Challenge , which resulted in the arrest of seven UK-resident men , who were accused of links to al-Jihad . One of the men was charged with possession of a weapon . Six months after the arrests , British Muslims staged a demonstration in front of 10 Downing Street to protest against the continued incarceration of the seven men . L'Houssaine Kherchtou , testifying for the United States , claimed that al-Fawwaz had been the leader of an Abu Bakr Siddique camp , which he contradictingly placed in Hayatabad , Pakistan , or Khost , Afghanistan . His trial , along with his co-defendant Abu Anas al Libi , also known as Nazih al Raghie or Anas al Sebai , was scheduled to begin on 3 November 2014 , before Judge Lewis A. Kaplan .",

Al-Qaeda operates as a network of Islamic extremists and Salafist jihadists . The organization has been designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations Security Council , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , the European Union , the United States , the United Kingdom , Russia , India , and various other countries ( see below ) . Al-Qaeda has mounted attacks on non-military and military targets in various countries , including the 1998 United States embassy bombings , the September 11 attacks , and the 2002 Bali bombings . The United States government responded to the September 11 attacks by launching the War on Terror , which sought to undermine al-Qaeda and its allies . The deaths of key leaders , including that of Osama bin Laden , have led al-Qaeda 's operations to shift from the top down organization and planning of attacks , to the planning of attacks which are carried out by associated groups and lone-wolf operators . Al-Qaeda characteristically employs attacks which include suicide attacks and the simultaneous bombing of several targets . Activities which are ascribed to al-Qaeda involve the actions of those who have made a pledge of loyalty to bin Laden , or to the actions of al-Qaeda-linked individuals who have undergone training in one of its camps in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iraq or Sudan . Al-Qaeda ideologues envision the removal of all foreign influences in Muslim countries . Al-Qaeda members believe that a Christian-Jewish alliance is conspiring to destroy Islam . As Salafist jihadists , members of al-Qaeda believe that the killing of non-combatants is religiously sanctioned . This belief ignores the aspects of religious scripture which forbid the murder of non-combatants and internecine fighting .",
  "/wiki/Conspiracy_(crime)": "In criminal law , a conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime at some time in the future . Criminal law in some countries or for some conspiracies may require that at least one overt act be undertaken in furtherance of that agreement , to constitute an offense . There is no limit on the number participating in the conspiracy and , in most countries , no requirement that any steps have been taken to put the plan into effect ( compare attempts which require proximity to the full offense ) . For the purposes of concurrence , the actus reus is a continuing one and parties may join the plot later and incur joint liability and conspiracy can be charged where the co-conspirators have been acquitted or can not be traced . Finally , repentance by one or more parties does not affect liability ( unless , in some cases , it occurs before the parties have committed overt acts ) but may reduce their sentence . An unindicted co-conspirator , or unindicted conspirator , is a person or entity that is alleged in an indictment to have engaged in conspiracy , but who is not charged in the same indictment . Prosecutors choose to name persons as unindicted co-conspirators for a variety of reasons including grants of immunity , pragmatic considerations , and evidentiary concerns .",

The attacks , which were linked to local members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad , brought Osama bin Laden , Ayman al-Zawahiri , and their terrorist organization , al-Qaeda , to the attention of the U.S. public for the first time , and resulted in the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) placing bin Laden on its ten most-wanted fugitives list . The FBI also connected the attack to Azerbaijan , as 60 calls were placed via satellite phone by bin Laden to associates in the country 's capital Baku .

He is considered to have been the most powerful drug trafficker in the world . Guzm\u00e1n was born in Sinaloa and raised in a poor farming family . He endured physical abuse at the hands of his father , and also entered the drug trade through his father , helping him grow marijuana for local dealers during his early adulthood . Guzm\u00e1n began working with H\u00e9ctor Luis Palma Salazar by the late 1970s , one of the nation 's rising drug lords . He helped Salazar map routes to move drugs through Sinaloa and into the United States . He later supervised logistics for Miguel \u00c1ngel F\u00e9lix Gallardo , one of the nation 's leading kingpins in the mid 1980s , but Guzm\u00e1n founded his own cartel in 1988 after Gallardo 's arrest . Guzm\u00e1n oversaw operations whereby mass cocaine , methamphetamine , marijuana , and heroin were produced , smuggled into , and distributed throughout the United States and Europe , the world 's largest users . He achieved this by pioneering the use of distribution cells and long-range tunnels near borders , which enabled him to export more drugs to the United States than any other trafficker in history . Guzm\u00e1n 's leadership of the cartel also brought immense wealth and power ; Forbes ranked him as one of the most powerful people in the world between 2009 and 2013 , while the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) estimated that he matched the influence and wealth of Pablo Escobar . Guzm\u00e1n was first captured in 1993 in Guatemala and was extradited and sentenced to 20 years in prison in Mexico for murder and drug trafficking . He bribed prison guards and escaped from a federal maximum-security prison in 2001 .",

The FCPA is applicable worldwide and extends specifically to publicly traded companies and their personnel , including officers , directors , employees , shareholders , and agents . Following amendments made in 1998 , the Act also applies to foreign firms and persons who , either directly or through intermediaries , help facilitate or carry out corrupt payments in U.S. territory . Pursuant to its anti-bribery purpose , the FCPA amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require all companies with securities listed in the U.S. to meet certain accounting provisions , such as ensuring accurate and transparent financial records and maintaining internal accounting controls . The FCPA is jointly enforced by the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , which apply criminal and civil penalties , respectively . Since its passage , the FCPA has been subject to controversy and criticism , namely whether its enforcement discourages U.S. companies from investing abroad . The Act was subsequently amended in 1988 to raise the standard of proof for a finding of bribery .",

  "/wiki/Silk_Road": "The Silk Road was a network of trade routes which connected the East and West , and was central to the economic , cultural , political , and religious interactions between these regions from the 2nd century BCE to the 18th century . The Silk Road primarily refers to the land routes connecting East Asia and Southeast Asia with South Asia , Persia , the Arabian Peninsula , East Africa and Southern Europe . The Silk Road derives its name from the lucrative trade in silk carried out along its length , beginning in the Han dynasty in China ( 207 BCE-220 CE ) . The Han dynasty expanded the Central Asian section of the trade routes around 114 BCE through the missions and explorations of the Chinese imperial envoy Zhang Qian , as well as several military conquests . The Chinese took great interest in the security of their trade products , and extended the Great Wall of China to ensure the protection of the trade route . The Silk Road trade played a significant role in the development of the civilizations of China , Korea , Japan , the Indian subcontinent , Iran , Europe , the Horn of Africa and Arabia , opening long-distance political and economic relations between the civilizations . Though silk was the major trade item exported from China , many other goods and ideas were exchanged , including religions ( especially Buddhism ) , syncretic philosophies , sciences , and technologies like paper and gunpowder . So in addition to economic trade , the Silk Road was a route for cultural trade among the civilizations along its network . Diseases , most notably plague , also spread along the Silk Road . In June 2014 , UNESCO designated the Chang'an-Tianshan corridor of the Silk Road as a World Heritage Site . The Indian portion is on the tentative site list .",
