  "/wiki/Georg_Philipp_Telemann": "Georg Philipp Telemann ( 24 March [ O.S . 14 March ] 1681 - 25 June 1767 ) ( German pronunciation : [ \u02c8te\u02d0l\u0259man ] ) was a German Baroque composer and multi-instrumentalist . Almost completely self-taught in music , he became a composer against his family 's wishes . After studying in Magdeburg , Zellerfeld , and Hildesheim , Telemann entered the University of Leipzig to study law , but eventually settled on a career in music . He held important positions in Leipzig , Sorau , Eisenach , and Frankfurt before settling in Hamburg in 1721 , where he became musical director of that city 's five main churches . While Telemann 's career prospered , his personal life was always troubled : his first wife died only a few months after their marriage , and his second wife had extramarital affairs and accumulated a large gambling debt before leaving him . Telemann is one of the most prolific composers in history ( at least in terms of surviving oeuvre ) and was considered by his contemporaries to be one of the leading German composers of the time - he was compared favorably both to his friend Johann Sebastian Bach , who made Telemann the godfather and namesake of his son Carl Philipp Emanuel , and to George Frideric Handel , whom Telemann also knew personally . As part of his duties , he wrote a considerable amount of music for educating organists under his direction . This includes 48 chorale preludes and 20 small fugues ( modal fugues ) to accompany his chorale harmonizations for 500 hymns . His music incorporates French , Italian , and German national styles , and he was at times even influenced by Polish popular music . He remained at the forefront of all new musical tendencies , and his music stands as an important link between the late Baroque and early Classical styles . The Telemann Museum in Hamburg is dedicated to him .",
  "/wiki/Pimpinone": "Pimpinone , TWV 21:15 , is a comic opera by the German composer Georg Philipp Telemann with a libretto by Johann Philipp Praetorius . Its full title is Die Ungleiche Heirat zwischen Vespetta und Pimpinone oder Das herrsch-s\u00fcchtige Camer M\u00e4gden ( The Unequal Marriage Between Vespetta and Pimpinone or The Domineering Chambermaid ) . The work is described as a Lustiges Zwischenspiel ( comic intermezzo ) in three parts . It was first performed at the Oper am G\u00e4nsemarkt in Hamburg on 27 September 1725 as light relief between the acts of Telemann 's adaptation of Handel 's opera seria Tamerlano . Pimpinone was highly successful and pointed the way forward to later intermezzi , particularly Giovanni Battista Pergolesi 's La serva padrona .",

Handel received important training in Halle and worked as a composer in Hamburg and Italy before settling in London in 1712 ; he became a naturalised British subject in 1727 . He was strongly influenced both by the great composers of the Italian Baroque and by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition . Within fifteen years , Handel had started three commercial opera companies to supply the English nobility with Italian opera . Musicologist Winton Dean writes that his operas show that Handel was not only a great composer ; he was a dramatic genius of the first order . As Alexander 's Feast ( 1736 ) was well received , Handel made a transition to English choral works . After his success with Messiah ( 1742 ) he never composed an Italian opera again . Almost blind , and having lived in England for nearly fifty years , he died in 1759 , a respected and rich man . His funeral was given full state honours , and he was buried in Westminster Abbey in London . Born the same year as Johann Sebastian Bach and Domenico Scarlatti , Handel is regarded as one of the greatest composers of the Baroque era , with works such as Messiah , Water Music , and Music for the Royal Fireworks remaining steadfastly popular .",

  "/wiki/Claudio_Monteverdi": "Claudio Giovanni Antonio Monteverdi ( /\u02ccm\u0252nt\u026a\u02c8v\u025b\u0259rdi/ , also US : /-\u02c8v\u025c\u02d0rd-/ , Italian : [ \u02c8klaudjo monte\u02c8verdi ] ( listen ) ; baptized 15 May 1567 - 29 November 1643 ) was an Italian composer , string player , choirmaster , and priest . A composer of both secular and sacred music , and a pioneer in the development of opera , he is considered a crucial transitional figure between the Renaissance and the Baroque periods of music history . Born in Cremona , where he undertook his first musical studies and compositions , Monteverdi developed his career first at the court of Mantua ( c. 1590-1613 ) and then until his death in the Republic of Venice where he was maestro di cappella at the basilica of San Marco . His surviving letters give insight into the life of a professional musician in Italy of the period , including problems of income , patronage and politics . Much of Monteverdi 's output , including many stage works , has been lost . His surviving music includes nine books of madrigals , large-scale sacred works such as his Vespro della Beata Vergine ( Vespers ) of 1610 , and three complete operas . His opera L'Orfeo ( 1607 ) is the earliest of the genre still widely performed ; towards the end of his life he wrote works for Venice , including Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria and L'incoronazione di Poppea . While he worked extensively in the tradition of earlier Renaissance polyphony , as evidenced in his madrigals , he undertook great developments in form and melody , and began to employ the basso continuo technique , distinctive of the Baroque . No stranger to controversy , he defended his sometimes novel techniques as elements of a seconda pratica , contrasting with the more orthodox earlier style which he termed the prima pratica . Largely forgotten during the eighteenth and much of the nineteenth centuries , his works enjoyed a rediscovery around the beginning of the twentieth century . He is now established both as a significant influence in European musical history and as a composer whose works are regularly performed and recorded .",
  "/wiki/L'Orfeo": "L'Orfeo ( SV 318 ) ( Italian pronunciation : [ lor\u02c8f\u025b\u02d0o ] ) , sometimes called La favola d'Orfeo [ la \u02c8fa\u02d0vola dor\u02c8f\u025b\u02d0o ] , is a late Renaissance/early Baroque favola in musica , or opera , by Claudio Monteverdi , with a libretto by Alessandro Striggio . It is based on the Greek legend of Orpheus , and tells the story of his descent to Hades and his fruitless attempt to bring his dead bride Eurydice back to the living world . It was written in 1607 for a court performance during the annual Carnival at Mantua . While Jacopo Peri 's Dafne is generally recognised as the first work in the opera genre , and the earliest surviving opera is Peri 's Euridice , L'Orfeo is the earliest that is still regularly performed . By the early 17th century the traditional intermedio - a musical sequence between the acts of a straight play - was evolving into the form of a complete musical drama or opera . Monteverdi 's L'Orfeo moved this process out of its experimental era and provided the first fully developed example of the new genre . After its initial performance the work was staged again in Mantua , and possibly in other Italian centres in the next few years . Its score was published by Monteverdi in 1609 and again in 1615 . After the composer 's death in 1643 the opera went unperformed for many years , and was largely forgotten until a revival of interest in the late 19th century led to a spate of modern editions and performances . At first these performances tended to be concert ( unstaged ) versions within institutes and music societies , but following the first modern dramatised performance in Paris , in 1911 , the work began to be seen in theatres . After the Second World War many recordings were issued , and the opera was increasingly staged in opera houses , although some leading venues resisted it . In 2007 , the quatercentenary of the premiere was celebrated by performances throughout the world .",
  "/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach": "Johann Sebastian Bach [ a ] ( 31 March [ O.S . 21 March ] 1685 - 28 July 1750 ) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period . He is known for instrumental compositions such as the Brandenburg Concertos and the Goldberg Variations , and for vocal music such as the St Matthew Passion and the Mass in B minor . Since the 19th-century Bach Revival he has generally been regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time . The Bach family already counted several composers when Johann Sebastian was born as the last child of a city musician in Eisenach . After being orphaned at age 10 , he lived for five years with his eldest brother Johann Christoph , after which he continued his musical formation in L\u00fcneburg . From 1703 he was back in Thuringia , working as a musician for Protestant churches in Arnstadt and M\u00fchlhausen and , for longer stretches of time , at courts in Weimar , where he expanded his organ repertory , and K\u00f6then , where he was mostly engaged with chamber music . From 1723 he was employed as Thomaskantor ( cantor at St. Thomas ) in Leipzig . He composed music for the principal Lutheran churches of the city , and for its university 's student ensemble Collegium Musicum . From 1726 he published some of his keyboard and organ music . In Leipzig , as had happened during some of his earlier positions , he had difficult relations with his employer , a situation that was little remedied when he was granted the title of court composer by his sovereign , Augustus , Elector of Saxony and King of Poland , in 1736 . In the last decades of his life he reworked and extended many of his earlier compositions .",
  "/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart [ a ] ( 27 January 1756 - 5 December 1791 ) , baptised as Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart , [ b ] was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical period . Born in Salzburg , Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood . Already competent on keyboard and violin , he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty . At 17 , Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position . While visiting Vienna in 1781 , he was dismissed from his Salzburg position . He chose to stay in the capital , where he achieved fame but little financial security . During his final years in Vienna , he composed many of his best-known symphonies , concertos , and operas , and portions of the Requiem , which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35 . The circumstances of his death have been much mythologized . He composed more than 600 works , many of which are acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic , concertante , chamber , operatic , and choral music . He is among the greatest and most enduringly popular of classical composers , and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music . Ludwig van Beethoven composed his early works in the shadow of Mozart , and Joseph Haydn wrote : posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years .",
  "/wiki/Requiem_(Mozart)": "The Requiem in D minor , K. 626 , is a requiem mass by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart ( 1756-1791 ) . Mozart composed part of the Requiem in Vienna in late 1791 , but it was unfinished at his death on 5 December the same year . A completed version dated 1792 by Franz Xaver S\u00fcssmayr was delivered to Count Franz von Walsegg , who commissioned the piece for a Requiem service to commemorate the anniversary of his wife 's death on 14 February . The autograph manuscript shows the finished and orchestrated Introit in Mozart 's hand , and detailed drafts of the Kyrie and the sequence Dies irae as far as the first eight bars of the Lacrimosa movement , and the Offertory . It can not be shown to what extent S\u00fcssmayr may have depended on now lost scraps of paper for the remainder ; he later claimed the Sanctus , the Benedictus and Agnus Dei as his own . Walsegg probably intended to pass the Requiem off as his own composition , as he is known to have done with other works . This plan was frustrated by a public benefit performance for Mozart 's widow Constanze . She was responsible for a number of stories surrounding the composition of the work , including the claims that Mozart received the commission from a mysterious messenger who did not reveal the commissioner 's identity , and that Mozart came to believe that he was writing the requiem for his own funeral . In addition to the S\u00fcssmayr version , a number of alternative completions have been developed by musicologists in the 20th century .",

He has been regarded in his homeland as the father of Czech music . Internationally he is best known for his opera The Bartered Bride and for the symphonic cycle M\u00e1 vlast ( My Homeland ) , which portrays the history , legends and landscape of the composer 's native Bohemia . It contains the famous symphonic poem Vltava , also known by its English name The Moldau . Smetana was naturally gifted as a composer , and gave his first public performance at the age of 6 . After conventional schooling , he studied music under Josef Proksch in Prague . His first nationalistic music was written during the 1848 Prague uprising , in which he briefly participated . After failing to establish his career in Prague , he left for Sweden , where he set up as a teacher and choirmaster in Gothenburg , and began to write large-scale orchestral works . During this period of his life Smetana was twice married ; of six daughters , three died in infancy . In the early 1860s , a more liberal political climate in Bohemia encouraged Smetana to return permanently to Prague . He threw himself into the musical life of the city , primarily as a champion of the new genre of Czech opera . In 1866 his first two operas , The Brandenburgers in Bohemia and The Bartered Bride , were premiered at Prague 's new Provisional Theatre , the latter achieving great popularity .",

He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally , bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States . He was honored in 1884 by Emperor Alexander III , and awarded a lifetime pension . Although musically precocious , Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant . There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education . When an opportunity for such an education arose , he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory , from which he graduated in 1865 . The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five , with whom his professional relationship was mixed . Tchaikovsky 's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood . From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style - a task that did not prove easy .",

It was composed no later than July 1688 , and had been performed at Josias Priest 's girls ' school in London by the end of 1689 . Some scholars argue for a date of composition as early as 1683 . The story is based on Book IV of Virgil 's Aeneid . It recounts the love of Dido , Queen of Carthage , for the Trojan hero Aeneas , and her despair when he abandons her . A monumental work in Baroque opera , Dido and Aeneas is remembered as one of Purcell 's foremost theatrical works . It was also Purcell 's only true opera , as well as his only all-sung dramatic work . One of the earliest known English operas , it owes much to John Blow 's Venus and Adonis , both in structure and in overall effect . The influence of Cavalli 's opera Didone is also apparent .

  "/wiki/London_Symphony_Orchestra": "The London Symphony Orchestra ( LSO ) , founded in 1904 , is a British Orchestra and the oldest of London 's symphony orchestras . It was set up by a group of players who left Henry Wood 's Queen 's Hall Orchestra because of a new rule requiring players to give the orchestra their exclusive services . The LSO itself later introduced a similar rule for its members . From the outset the LSO was organised on co-operative lines , with all players sharing the profits at the end of each season . This practice continued for the orchestra 's first four decades . The LSO underwent periods of eclipse in the 1930s and 1950s when it was regarded as inferior in quality to new London orchestras , to which it lost players and bookings : the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the London Philharmonic in the 1930s and the Philharmonia and Royal Philharmonic after the Second World War . The profit-sharing principle was abandoned in the post-war era as a condition of receiving public subsidy for the first time . In the 1950s the orchestra debated whether to concentrate on film work at the expense of symphony concerts ; many senior players left when the majority of players rejected the idea . By the 1960s the LSO had recovered its leading position , which it has retained subsequently .

The influence of Tchaikovsky , Rimsky-Korsakov , Balakirev , Mussorgsky , and other Russian composers is seen in his early works , later giving way to a personal style notable for song-like melodicism , expressiveness and rich orchestral colors . Born into a musical family , Rachmaninoff took up the piano at the age of four . He graduated from the Moscow Conservatory in 1892 , having already composed several piano and orchestral pieces . In 1897 , following the negative critical reaction to his Symphony No . 1 , Rachmaninoff entered a four-year depression and composed little until successful therapy allowed him to complete his enthusiastically received Piano Concerto No . 2 in 1901 . In the course of the next sixteen years , Rachmaninoff conducted at the Bolshoi Theatre , relocated to Dresden , Germany , and toured the United States for the first time . Rachmaninoff often featured the piano in his compositions , and he explored the expressive possibilities of the instrument through his own skills as a pianist . Following the Russian Revolution , Rachmaninoff and his family left Russia ; in 1918 , they settled in the United States , first in New York City .",

He is often associated with impressionism along with his elder contemporary Claude Debussy , although both composers rejected the term . In the 1920s and 1930s Ravel was internationally regarded as France 's greatest living composer . Born to a music-loving family , Ravel attended France 's premier music college , the Paris Conservatoire ; he was not well regarded by its conservative establishment , whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal . After leaving the conservatoire , Ravel found his own way as a composer , developing a style of great clarity and incorporating elements of baroque , neoclassicism and , in his later works , jazz . He liked to experiment with musical form , as in his best-known work , Bol\u00e9ro ( 1928 ) , in which repetition takes the place of development . He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers ' music , of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky 's Pictures at an Exhibition is the best known . A slow and painstaking worker , Ravel composed fewer pieces than many of his contemporaries . Among his works to enter the repertoire are pieces for piano , chamber music , two piano concertos , ballet music , two operas and eight song cycles ; he wrote no symphonies or church music . Many of his works exist in two versions : first , a piano score and later an orchestration . Some of his piano music , such as Gaspard de la nuit ( 1908 ) , is exceptionally difficult to play , and his complex orchestral works such as Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9 ( 1912 ) require skilful balance in performance . Ravel was among the first composers to recognise the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public .",

When he was 35 , he moved to Hamburg to work as the director of music for the Johanneum and for civic musical events . The next ten years were a golden age in the musical tradition of Hamburg : Bernhard and his good friend Matthias Weckmann performed together and directed the latest compositions from Italy and Vienna , as well as composing an important collection of music in finely-wrought counterpoint . The Elector of Saxony recalled Bernhard to Dresden in 1674 , where he returned as assistant kapellmeister . Six years later , the large - and primarily Italian - musical establishment in the city was greatly reduced , until Bernhard remained the only kapellmeister at court . He continued composing , directing and caring for the music library in Dresden until his death in 1692 , at the age of 64 . Bernhard left behind many sacred vocal works , a few secular compositions , and three important treatises on music , the most famous of which is the Tractatus compositionis augmentatus ( ca . 1657 ) , which was the source of the term passus duriusculus .",

The only known contemporaneous score is for organ continuo alone though this is sometimes augmented in performance by violins and string bass , for which some support exists in other works by the composer . A 1976 version exists arranged by Hans Werner Henze for 7 solo voices , 6 part chorus , flutes , percussion and plucked strings ."
