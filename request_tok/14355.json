  "/wiki/Title_character": "The title character in a narrative work is one who is named or referred to in the title of the work . In a performed work such as a play or film , the performer who plays the title character is said to have the title role of the piece . The title of the work might consist solely of the title character 's name - such as Michael Collins or Othello - or be a longer phrase or sentence - such as The Autobiography of Malcolm X or The Adventures of Tom Sawyer . The title character is commonly - but not necessarily - the protagonist of the story . Narrative works routinely do not have a title character , and there is some ambiguity in what qualifies as one . Examples in various media include Aida in the opera of the same name , Giselle in the ballet of the same name , the Doctor in the TV series Doctor Who , Harry Potter in the series of novels and films , Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet in the play Romeo and Juliet , and Amos Jones and Andy Brown in the radio and TV dramas Amos ' n ' Andy .",

Starring Sarah Jessica Parker ( as Carrie Bradshaw ) and co-starring Kim Cattrall ( as Samantha Jones ) , Kristin Davis ( as Charlotte York ) , and Cynthia Nixon ( as Miranda Hobbes ) , the quirky series had multiple continuing storylines that tackled relevant and modern social issues such as sexuality , safe sex , promiscuity , and femininity , while exploring the difference between friendships and romantic relationships . The deliberate omission of the better part of the early lives of the four women was the writers ' way of exploring social life - from sex to relationships - through each of their four very different , individual perspectives . Sex and the City has received both acclaim and criticism for its subjects and characters , and is credited with helping to increase HBO 's popularity as a network .

  "/wiki/Film": "Film , also called movie or motion picture or ( less widely ) The Seventh Art , is a visual art-form used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas , stories , perceptions , feelings , beauty or atmosphere , by the means of recorded or programmed [ vague ] moving images , along with sound ( and more rarely ) other sensory stimulations . The word cinema , short for cinematography , is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry , and to the art form that is the result of it . The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera , by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques , by means of CGI and computer animation , or by a combination of some or all of these techniques , and other visual effects . Traditionally , films were recorded onto celluloid film through a photochemical process and then shown through a movie projector onto a large screen . Contemporary films are often fully digital through the entire process of production , distribution , and exhibition , while films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally included an analogous optical soundtrack ( a graphic recording of the spoken words , music and other sounds that accompany the images which runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it , and is not projected ) . Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures . They reflect those cultures , and , in turn , affect them . Film is considered to be an important art form , a source of popular entertainment , and a powerful medium for educating - or indoctrinating - citizens . The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication . Some films have become popular worldwide attractions through the use of dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into other languages . The individual images that make up a film are called frames . In the projection of traditional celluloid films , a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame , in turn , is moved into position to be projected , but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision , whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after its source disappears .",

A film director controls a film 's artistic and dramatic aspects and visualizes the screenplay ( or script ) while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfilment of that vision .

The film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized , or noticed . Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay within the budget . There are many pathways to becoming a film director . Some film directors started as screenwriters , cinematographers , producers , film editors or actors . Other film directors have attended a film school . Directors use different approaches . Some outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue , while others control every aspect , and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely . Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners .",

  "/wiki/Drama": "Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance : a play , opera , mime , ballet , etc. , performed in a theatre , or on radio or television . Considered as a genre of poetry in general , the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle 's Poetics ( c. 335 BC ) - the earliest work of dramatic theory . The term drama comes from a Greek word meaning action ( Classical Greek : \u03b4\u03c1\u1fb6\u03bc\u03b1 , drama ) , which is derived from I do ( Classical Greek : \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c9 , drao ) . The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy . In English ( as was the analogous case in many other European languages ) , the word play or game ( translating the Anglo-Saxon ple\u0121an or Latin ludus ) was the standard term for dramas until William Shakespeare 's time - just as its creator was a play-maker rather than a dramatist and the building was a play-house rather than a theatre . The use of drama in a more narrow sense to designate a specific type of play dates from the modern era . Drama in this sense refers to a play that is neither a comedy nor a tragedy - for example , Zola 's Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin ( 1873 ) or Chekhov 's Ivanov ( 1887 ) . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted to describe drama as a genre within their respective media . The term radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance . May also refer to the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio . The enactment of drama in theatre , performed by actors on a stage before an audience , presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception . The structure of dramatic texts , unlike other forms of literature , is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception .",
  "/wiki/Terminal_illness": "Terminal illness or end-stage disease is a disease that can not be cured or adequately treated and is reasonably expected to result in death of the patient . This term is more commonly used for progressive diseases such as cancer or advanced heart disease than for trauma . In popular use , it indicates a disease that will progress until death with near absolute certainty , regardless of treatment . A patient who has such an illness may be referred to as a terminal patient , terminally ill or simply terminal . There is no standardized life expectancy for a patient to be considered terminal , although it is generally months or less . Life expectancy for terminal patients is a rough estimate given by the physician based on previous data and does not always reflect true longevity . An illness which is lifelong but not fatal is a chronic condition . Terminal patients have options for disease management after diagnosis . Examples include caregiving , continued treatment , hospice care , and physician-assisted suicide . Decisions regarding management are made by the patient and his or her family , although medical professionals may give recommendations or more about the services available to terminal patients . Lifestyle after diagnosis largely varies depending on management decisions and also the nature of the disease , and there may be living restrictions depending on the condition of the patient . Oftentimes , terminal patients may experience depression or anxiety associated with oncoming death , and family and caregivers may struggle with psychological burdens as well .",
