The site has been inhabited for the last 4,500 years , first by the Inuit peoples of the Saqqaq culture , Dorset culture , and then the Thule people , whose descendants form the majority of the current population . Artifacts from the early settlement era can be found throughout the region , favored in the past for its plentiful fauna , particularly the marine mammals providing subsistence for the early hunting societies . The population of modern Greenlanders in Sisimiut is a mix of the Inuit and Danish peoples , who first settled in the area in the 1720s , under the leadership of the Danish missionary , Hans Egede . Today , Sisimiut is the largest business center north of the national capital of Nuuk and is one of the fastest growing cities in Greenland . Fishing is the principal industry in Sisimiut , although the town has a growing industrial base . KNI and its subsidiary Pilersuisoq , a state-owned chain of all-purpose general stores in Greenland , have their base in Sisimiut .
