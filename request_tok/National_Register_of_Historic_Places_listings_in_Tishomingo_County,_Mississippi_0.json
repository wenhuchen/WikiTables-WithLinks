  "/wiki/Bear_Creek_Fishweir_No._1": "The Bear Creek Fishweir # 1 is a historic fishing weir on Bear Creek in Tishomingo State Park , in northeastern Mississippi . It consists of a fieldstone dam extending from the south bank of the creek at an angle for about 40 metres ( 130 ft ) , with evidence that a similar but shorter dam extended for some 8 metres ( 26 ft ) from the north bank . The two dams formed a V shape with a narrow chute between them . At that point there is evidence of a 20th-century fish trap constructed of wooden elements , of which only fragments remained . Its known history is that it was built ( or more likely , rebuilt ) by William Wiley Leatherwood , whose family maintained the weir . State law requiring weirs to not impede waterflow was passed in the 1920s , leading to its decreased effectiveness and eventual abandonment . The weir is one of the best-preserved such structures in northeastern Mississippi , many of the others having been destroyed to improve water flow . The weir wa listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005 .",

  "/wiki/Bear_Creek_Fishweir_No._2": "The Bear Creek Fishweir # 2 is a historic fishing weir on Bear Creek in Tishomingo State Park , northeastern Mississippi . The weir consists of a roughly V-shaped stone construction , built from readily available local sandstone . The walls of the weir meet closer to the western bank of the creek , where they form a chute estimated to be 11 metres ( 36 ft ) in length . At the end of the chute there would have been a fish trap of wooden construction , of which no traces remain . The weir was almost certainly maintained by local residents into the early 20th century , but may have been built on the site of an earlier construction by Native Americans . This weir , along with Bear Creek Fishweir # 1 , is one of the best-preserved surviving weirs in northeastern Mississippi . The weir was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007 .",

Ulysses S. Grant brought two armies to confront Price in a double envelopment : Rosecrans 's Army of the Mississippi , approaching Iuka from the southwest , and three divisions of his own Army of the Tennessee under Maj. Gen. Edward Ord , approaching from the northwest . Although Grant and Ord planned to attack in conjunction with Rosecrans when they heard the sound of battle , an acoustic shadow suppressed the sound and prevented them from realizing that the battle had begun . After an afternoon of fighting , entirely by Rosecrans 's men , the Confederates withdrew from Iuka on a road that had not been blocked by the Union army , marching to rendezvous with Confederate Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn , with whom they would soon fight the Second Battle of Corinth against Rosecrans .",
