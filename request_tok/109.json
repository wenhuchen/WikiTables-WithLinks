He is an associate professor and principal research fellow within the department of Electronics and Computer Science at the University of Southampton where he specialises in the politics , philosophy and epistemology of technology . He is also a research fellow at the Web Science Trust and the conservative think-tank , the Centre for Policy Studies . In Conservatism ( 2011 ) , O'Hara developed the philosophy of 'small-c conservatism ' that he originally outlined in After Blair ( 2005/7 ) . He argued that conservatism must be a philosophy concerned with social change , and must be defensible using public reason . To that end , he defined conservatism as the knowledge principle plus the change principle . The knowledge principle , influenced by scepticism , states that : because society and its mediating institutions are highly complex and dynamic with natures that are constantly evolving as they are co-constituted with the individuals who are their members , both data and theories about society are highly uncertain . The change principle adds : because the current state of society is typically undervalued , and because the effects of social innovations can not be known fully in advance , then social change ( a ) must always risk destroying beneficial institutions and norms and ( b ) can not be guaranteed to achieve the aims for which it was implemented . It therefore follows that societies should be risk-averse with respect to social change , and the burden of proof placed on the innovator , not his or her opponents . It also follows that change , when it does come , should ideally be ( a ) incremental , ( b ) reversible where possible and ( c ) rigorously evaluated before the next incremental step . Influenced by Edmund Burke , Adam Smith , Michael Oakeshott and Friedrich Hayek , O'Hara distanced conservative philosophy from free-market liberalism and neo-conservatism . He also developed ideas about risk and uncertainty about the environment to sketch a type of green conservatism .",

Computer scientists typically work on the theoretical side of computer systems , as opposed to the hardware side on which computer engineers mainly focus ( although there is overlap ) . Although computer scientists can also focus their work and research on specific areas ( such as algorithm and data structure development and design , software engineering , information theory , database theory , computational complexity theory , numerical analysis , programming language theory , computer graphics , and computer vision ) , their foundation is the theoretical study of computing from which these other fields derive . A primary goal of computer scientists is to develop or validate models , often mathematical , to describe the properties of computer-based systems ( processors , programs , computers interacting with people , computers interacting with other computers , etc . ) with an overall objective of discovering designs that yield useful benefits ( faster , smaller , cheaper , more precise , etc . ) .",

  "/wiki/Literary_critic": "Literary criticism ( or literary studies ) is the study , evaluation , and interpretation of literature . Modern literary criticism is often influenced by literary theory , which is the philosophical discussion of literature 's goals and methods . Though the two activities are closely related , literary critics are not always , and have not always been , theorists . Whether or not literary criticism should be considered a separate field of inquiry from literary theory , or conversely from book reviewing , is a matter of some controversy . For example , the Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism draws no distinction between literary theory and literary criticism , and almost always uses the terms together to describe the same concept . Some critics consider literary criticism a practical application of literary theory , because criticism always deals directly with particular literary works , while theory may be more general or abstract . Literary criticism is often published in essay or book form . Academic literary critics teach in literature departments and publish in academic journals , and more popular critics publish their reviews in broadly circulating periodicals such as The Times Literary Supplement , The New York Times Book Review , The New York Review of Books , the London Review of Books , the Dublin Review of Books , The Nation , Bookforum , and The New Yorker .",

The earliest recorded use of the term in English is from 1624 , in the second edition of The Anatomy of Melancholy by Robert Burton ; the form polymathist is slightly older , first appearing in the Diatribae upon the first part of the late History of Tithes of Richard Montagu in 1621 . Use in English of the similar term polyhistor dates from the late sixteenth century . In Western Europe , the first work to use polymathy in its title ( De Polymathia tractatio : integri operis de studiis veterum ) was published in 1603 by Johann von Wowern ( de ) , a Hamburg philosopher . Von Wowern defined polymathy as knowledge of various matters , drawn from all kinds of studies [ . ] ranging freely through all the fields of the disciplines , as far as the human mind , with unwearied industry , is able to pursue them . Von Wowern lists erudition , literature , philology , philomathy and polyhistory as synonyms . Polymaths include the great thinkers of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment , who excelled at several fields in science , technology , engineering , mathematics , and the arts . In the Italian Renaissance , the idea of the polymath was expressed by Leon Battista Alberti ( 1404-1472 ) in the statement that a man can do all things if he will . Embodying a basic tenet of Renaissance humanism that humans are limitless in their capacity for development , the concept led to the notion that people should embrace all knowledge and develop their capacities as fully as possible . This is expressed in the term Renaissance man , often applied to the gifted people of that age who sought to develop their abilities in all areas of accomplishment : intellectual , artistic , social , physical , and spiritual .",

By the eighteenth century , Scotland had a network of parish schools in the Lowlands and four universities . The Enlightenment culture was based on close readings of new books , and intense discussions took place daily at such intellectual gathering places in Edinburgh as The Select Society and , later , The Poker Club , as well as within Scotland 's ancient universities ( St Andrews , Aberdeen , Glasgow , and Edinburgh ) . Sharing the humanist and rationalist outlook of the European Enlightenment of the same time period , the thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment asserted the importance of human reason combined with a rejection of any authority that could not be justified by reason . In Scotland , the Enlightenment was characterised by a thoroughgoing empiricism and practicality where the chief values were improvement , virtue , and practical benefit for the individual and society as a whole . Among the fields that rapidly advanced were philosophy , political economy , engineering , architecture , medicine , geology , archaeology , botany and zoology , law , agriculture , chemistry and sociology . Among the Scottish thinkers and scientists of the period were Francis Hutcheson , David Hume , Adam Smith , Dugald Stewart , Thomas Reid , Robert Burns , Adam Ferguson , John Playfair , Joseph Black and James Hutton .

It does not include literature written in the other languages of Britain . The English language has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . The earliest forms of English , a set of Anglo-Frisian dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the fifth century , are called Old English . Beowulf is the most famous work in Old English , and has achieved national epic status in England , despite being set in Scandinavia . However , following the Norman conquest of England in 1066 , the written form of the Anglo-Saxon language became less common . Under the influence of the new aristocracy , French became the standard language of courts , parliament , and polite society . The English spoken after the Normans came is known as Middle English . This form of English lasted until the 1470s , when the Chancery Standard ( late Middle English ) , a London-based form of English , became widespread . Geoffrey Chaucer ( 1343 - 1400 ) , author of The Canterbury Tales , was a significant figure in the development of the legitimacy of vernacular Middle English at a time when the dominant literary languages in England were still French and Latin .

Research on language through the sub-branches of historical and evolutionary linguistics also focuses on how languages change and grow , particularly over an extended period of time . The earliest activities in the documentation and description of language have been attributed to the 6th-century-BC Indian grammarian P\u0101\u1e47ini who wrote a formal description of the Sanskrit language in his A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b . Related areas of study include the disciplines of semiotics ( the study of direct and indirect language through signs and symbols ) , literary criticism ( the historical and ideological analysis of literature , cinema , art , or published material ) , translation ( the conversion and documentation of meaning in written/spoken text from one language or dialect onto another ) , and speech-language pathology ( a corrective method to cure phonetic disabilities and dis-functions at the cognitive level ) .",

  "/wiki/British_Museum": "The British Museum , in the Bloomsbury area of London , United Kingdom , is a public institution dedicated to human history , art and culture . Its permanent collection of some eight million works is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence , having been widely sourced during the era of the British Empire . It documents the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present . [ a ] It was the first public national museum in the world . The British Museum was established in 1753 , largely based on the collections of the Irish physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane . It first opened to the public in 1759 , in Montagu House , on the site of the current building . Its expansion over the following 250 years was largely a result of expanding British colonisation and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions , the first being the Natural History Museum in 1881 . In 1973 , the British Library Act 1972 detached the library department from the British Museum , but it continued to host the now separated British Library in the same Reading Room and building as the museum until 1997 . The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital , Culture , Media and Sport , and as with all national museums in the UK it charges no admission fee , except for loan exhibitions . Its ownership of some of its most famous objects originating in other countries is disputed and remains the subject of international controversy , most notably in the case of the Parthenon Marbles .",
  "/wiki/Cox-Forbes_theory": "The Cox-Forbes theory is a long-debunked theory on the evolution of chess put forward by Captain Hiram Cox ( 1760-1799 ) and extended by Professor Duncan Forbes ( 1798-1868 ) . The theory states that a four-handed dice-chess game ( Chaturaji ) was originated in India in approximately 3000 BC ; and that arising from the results of certain rules , or the difficulty in getting enough players , the game evolved into a two-handed game ( Chaturanga ) . On account of religious and legal objections in Hinduism to gambling , the dice were dropped from the game , making it a game of pure skill .",

  "/wiki/Hebrew": "Hebrew ( /\u02c8hi\u02d0bru\u02d0/ ; \u05e2\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea , Ivrit Hebrew pronunciation : [ iv\u02c8\u0281it ] or [ \u0295iv\u02c8\u027eit ] ( listen ) ) is a Northwest Semitic language native to Israel . In 2013 , Modern Hebrew was spoken by over nine million people worldwide . Historically , it is regarded as the language of the Israelites and their ancestors , although the language was not referred to by the name Hebrew in the Tanakh itself . [ note 1 ] The earliest examples of written Paleo-Hebrew date from the 10th century BCE . Hebrew belongs to the West Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family . Hebrew is the only Canaanite language still spoken , and the only truly successful example of a revived dead language . Hebrew had ceased to be an everyday spoken language somewhere between 200 and 400 CE , declining since the aftermath of the Bar Kokhba revolt . [ note 2 ] Aramaic and , to a lesser extent , Greek were already in use as international languages , especially among elites and immigrants . Hebrew survived into the medieval period as the language of Jewish liturgy , rabbinic literature , intra-Jewish commerce and poetry . With the rise of Zionism in the 19th century , it was revived as a spoken and literary language , becoming the main language of the Yishuv , and subsequently of the State of Israel . According to Ethnologue , in 1998 , Hebrew was the language of five million people worldwide . After Israel , the United States has the second-largest Hebrew-speaking population , with about 220,000 fluent speakers , mostly from Israel .",
