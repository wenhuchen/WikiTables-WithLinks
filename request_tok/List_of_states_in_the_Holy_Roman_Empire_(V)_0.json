It included territory in Hesse and other parts of present-day Germany . While formally independent , it was a vassal state of the First French Empire and was ruled by Napoleon 's brother J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte . It was named after Westphalia , but this was a misnomer since the kingdom had little territory in common with that area ; rather the kingdom mostly covered territory formerly known as Eastphalia . Napoleon imposed the first written modern constitution in Germany , a French-style central administration , and agricultural reform . The Kingdom liberated the serfs and gave everyone equal rights and the right to a jury trial . In 1808 the Kingdom passed Germany 's first laws granting Jews equal rights , thereby providing a model for reform in the other German states . Westphalia seemed to be progressive in immediately enacting and enforcing the new reforms . The country was relatively poor but Napoleon demanded heavy taxes and payments and conscripted soldiers . Few of the men who marched into Russia with Napoleon in 1812 ever returned . The Kingdom was bankrupt by 1812 . When Napoleon was retreating in the face of Allied advances in 1813 , the Kingdom was overrun by the Allies and ( in 1815 ) most of its territories became Prussian ruled .",
  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hanover": "The Kingdom of Hanover ( German : K\u00f6nigreich Hannover ) was established in October 1814 by the Congress of Vienna , with the restoration of George III to his Hanoverian territories after the Napoleonic era . It succeeded the former Electorate of Hanover ( known formally as the Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg ) , and joined 38 other sovereign states in the German Confederation in June 1815 . The kingdom was ruled by the House of Hanover , a cadet branch of the House of Welf , in personal union with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland since 1714 . Since its monarch resided in London , a viceroy ( usually a younger member of the British Royal Family ) handled the administration of the Kingdom of Hanover . The personal union with the United Kingdom ended in 1837 upon the accession of Queen Victoria because females could not inherit the Hanoverian throne , so her uncle became the ruler of Hanover . Hanover backed the losing side in the Austro-Prussian War and was conquered by Prussia in 1866 , subsequently becoming a Prussian province . Along with the rest of Prussia , Hanover became part of the German Empire upon unification in January 1871 . Briefly revived as the State of Hanover in 1946 , the state was subsequently merged with some smaller states to form the current state of Lower Saxony in West Germany , later Germany .",

It was de facto dissolved by an emergency decree transferring powers of the Prussian government to German Chancellor Franz von Papen in 1932 and de jure by an Allied decree in 1947 . For centuries , the House of Hohenzollern ruled Prussia , successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army . Prussia , with its capital first in K\u00f6nigsberg and then , in 1701 , in Berlin , decisively shaped the history of Germany . In 1871 , most German states ( notably excluding Austria and Switzerland ) united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership . In November 1918 , the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 1918-19 . The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republic - the Free State of Prussia , a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933 . From 1933 , Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup , when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its Gleichschaltung laws in pursuit of a unitary state . With the end of the Nazi regime , in 1945 , the division of Germany into Allied occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the Oder-Neisse line , which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union , the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto . Prussia existed de jure until its formal abolition by the Allied Control Council Enactment No . 46 of 25 February 1947 . The name Prussia derives from the Old Prussians ; in the 13th century , the Teutonic Knights - an organized Catholic medieval military order of German crusaders - conquered the lands inhabited by them .",
