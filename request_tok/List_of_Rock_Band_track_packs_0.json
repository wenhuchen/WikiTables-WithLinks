  "/wiki/All_the_Small_Things": "All the Small Things is a song by the American rock band Blink-182 . It was the second single and eighth track released from the band 's third album Enema of the State ( 1999 ) . The track was composed primarily by guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge as an ode to his then girlfriend . Recorded in Los Angeles with producer Jerry Finn , the song was created with the intention of shipping it to radio , as the trio felt they needed a single really catchy and basic . The single was released in early 2000 and promptly charted worldwide , becoming a number one hit on Billboard 's Modern Rock Tracks chart , peaking at number two on the UK Singles Chart , and crossing over to pop radio and peaking at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 . The song remains the band 's most successful single to date , being their only song to break the Top 40 . The song charted within the top 20 in ten other countries , and gained greater significance due to its accompanying music video , which parodies and mocks the boy bands Backstreet Boys , 98 Degrees , and ' N Sync and the pop singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera . The video was popular in rotation on MTV 's Total Request Live , leading to criticism from those who felt their basis for parody was thin . All the Small Things was selected by Rolling Stone as one of the 100 Greatest Pop Songs , and is listed in the 2010 book 1001 Songs You Must Hear Before You Die .",

The current lineup features Corgan , Chamberlin , Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder . Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries , they have a diverse , densely layered , and guitar-heavy sound , containing elements of gothic rock , heavy metal , dream pop , psychedelic rock , progressive rock , shoegazing , and electronica in later recordings . Corgan is the group 's primary songwriter ; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band 's albums and songs , which have been described as anguished , bruised reports from Billy Corgan 's nightmare-land . The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album , 1993 's Siamese Dream . The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up , the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness , debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart . With 30 million albums sold worldwide , the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s . However , internal fighting , drug use , and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up . In 2006 , Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album , Zeitgeist . After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder , Chamberlin left the band in early 2009 . Later that year , Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope , which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles , compilation EP releases , and two full albums that also fell under the project 's scope - Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014 .",
