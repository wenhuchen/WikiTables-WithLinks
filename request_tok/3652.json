Citizen Kane is particularly praised for Gregg Toland 's cinematography , Robert Wise 's editing , Bernard Herrmann 's music , and its narrative structure , all of which have been considered innovative and precedent-setting . The quasi-biographical film examines the life and legacy of Charles Foster Kane , played by Welles , a character based in part upon the American newspaper magnates William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer , Chicago tycoons Samuel Insull and Harold McCormick , and aspects of the screenwriters ' own lives . Upon its release , Hearst prohibited mention of the film in any of his newspapers . After the Broadway successes of Welles 's Mercury Theatre and the controversial 1938 radio broadcast The War of the Worlds on The Mercury Theatre on the Air , Welles was courted by Hollywood . He signed a contract with RKO Pictures in 1939 . Although it was unusual for an untried director , he was given the freedom to develop his own story , to use his own cast and crew , and to have final cut privilege . Following two abortive attempts to get a project off the ground , he wrote the screenplay for Citizen Kane , collaborating on the effort with Herman Mankiewicz .",

Wells 's novel The War of the Worlds , which caused widespread panic because many listeners thought that an invasion by extraterrestrial beings was actually occurring . Although some contemporary sources say these reports of panic were mostly false and overstated , they rocketed Welles to notoriety . His first film was Citizen Kane ( 1941 ) , which is consistently ranked as the greatest film ever made , which he co-wrote , produced , directed and starred in as Charles Foster Kane . Welles released twelve other features , the most acclaimed of which include The Magnificent Ambersons ( 1942 ) , The Lady from Shanghai ( 1947 ) , Touch of Evil ( 1958 ) , The Trial ( 1962 ) , Chimes at Midnight ( 1966 ) and F for Fake ( 1973 ) .
