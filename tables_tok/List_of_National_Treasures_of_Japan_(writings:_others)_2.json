  "section_title": "Treasures -- Zen monk writings , bokuseki",
  "section_text": "The bokuseki style developed from Song Dynasty calligraphy . It was brought from China to Japan , together with Zen Buddhism , starting with Eisai in 1191 . [ 98 ] Late-12th century works imported from China were highly regarded in Japan ; subsequently Japanese priests began producing their own bokuseki in the 13th and 14th centuries . [ 97 ] Later bokuseki became part of the zen practice and served as meditation help . [ 95 ] They were often mounted on hanging scrolls , and displayed in temples and tea rooms . [ 94 ] [ 97 ] [ 99 ] The master of the Japanese tea ceremony Sen no Riky\u016b considered them crucial to the tea ceremony in the sense that they put the participants in the right frame-of-mind . [ 97 ] Bokuseki gained in importance through the chanoyu in the Muromachi and Momoyama periods . [ 98 ] Dait\u014d Kokushi and Mus\u014d Soseki , both from the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism , were the most famous bokuseki masters of the time . [ 98 ] The bokuseki style is present in a variety of Zen genres such as Buddhist sermons or Dharma talks ( h\u014dgo ) , certificates of enlightenment ( inkaj\u014d ) , death verses ( yuige ) , gatha verses ( geju ) , poetry [ nb 8 ] ( shi ) , letters , names and titles given to a monk by his master ( jigo ) , exhortory sermons ( shid\u014dgo ) , gakuji , [ nb 9 ] inscriptions on Zen paintings ( san ) and Zen circles . [ 94 ] [ 95 ] [ 101 ] There are 23 bokuseki National Treasures of various types including inkaj\u014d , h\u014dgo , letters and yuige . They date from the 12th to 14th centuries and have been mounted on hanging scrolls . [ 4 ]",
  "uid": "List_of_National_Treasures_of_Japan_(writings:_others)_2",
  "intro": "The term National Treasure has been used in Japan to denote cultural properties since 1897,\nalthough the definition and the criteria have changed since the introduction of the term. The written materials in the list adhere to the current definition, and have been designated National Treasures according to the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties that came into effect on June 9, 1951. The items are selected by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology based on their especially high historical or artistic value. The list presents 104 entries from the Western Wei dynasty to the Meiji period with most dating to the period of Classical Japan and Mid-Imperial China from the 7th to 14th century. The total number of items is higher, however, since groups of related objects have been joined as single entries. The list contains various types of written materials such as sutra copies, Buddhist commentaries and teachings, poetry and letters. Some of the designated objects originated in China, and were imported at a time when writing was being introduced to Japan. The items in this list were predominantly made with a writing brush on manuscript scrolls, which was the preferred medium until the advent of commercial printing and publishing in the 17th century. In many cases the manuscripts are noted examples of calligraphy. They are housed in temples, museums, libraries or archives, shrines, universities and in private collections. The writings in this list represent about half of the 228 National Treasures in the category writings. They are complemented by 68 Japanese and 56 Chinese book National Treasures of the List of National Treasures of Japan (writings: Japanese books) and the List of National Treasures of Japan (writings: Chinese books)."
