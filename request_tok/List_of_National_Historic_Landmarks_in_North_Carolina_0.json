  "/wiki/Bentonville,_North_Carolina": "The Battle of Bentonville ( March 19 - 21 , 1865 ) was fought in Johnston County , North Carolina , near the village of Bentonville , as part of the Western Theater of the American Civil War . It was the last battle between the armies of Union Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman and Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston . As the right wing of Sherman 's army under command of Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard marched toward Goldsboro , the left wing under command of Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum encountered the entrenched men of Johnston 's army . On the first day of the battle , the Confederates attacked the XIV Corps and routed two divisions , but the rest of Sherman 's army defended its positions successfully . The next day , as Sherman sent reinforcements to the battlefield and expected Johnston to withdraw , only minor sporadic fighting occurred . On the third day , as skirmishing continued , the division of Maj. Gen. Joseph A. Mower followed a path into the Confederate rear and attacked . The Confederates were able to repulse the attack as Sherman ordered Mower back to connect with his own corps . Johnston elected to withdraw from the battlefield that night . As a result of the overwhelming Union strength and the heavy casualties his army suffered in the battle , Johnston surrendered to Sherman little more than a month later at Bennett Place , near Durham Station . Coupled with Gen. Robert E. Lee 's surrender on April 9 , Johnston 's surrender represented the effective end of the war .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_architecture": "Gothic architecture ( Latin : francigenum opus ) is a style that flourished in Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages . It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture . Originating in 12th-century France , it was widely used , especially for cathedrals and churches , until the 16th century . Its most prominent features included the use of the rib vault and the flying buttress , which allowed the weight of the roof to be counterbalanced by buttresses outside the building , giving greater height and more space for windows . Another important feature was the extensive use of stained glass and the rose window , to bring light and color to the interior . Another feature was the use of realistic statuary on the exterior , particularly over the portals , to illustrate biblical stories for the largely illiterate parishioners . Some key architectural features , such as the pointed arch and a decorative kind of rib vault , existed earlier outside Europe , and may have been derived from Islamic architecture . These features had both existed in Romanesque architecture , but they were used more extensively and in more innovative ways to make Gothic cathedrals higher , stronger , and filled with light . The first important example is generally considered to be the Basilica of Saint-Denis , near Paris , whose choir was reconstructed with Gothic rib vaults and large stained glass windows between 1140 and 1144 .",

  "/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War": "The American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) , also known as the American War of Independence , was fought primarily between the Kingdom of Great Britain and her Thirteen Colonies in America ; it resulted in the overthrow of British rule in the colonies and the establishment of the United States of America . [ N 1 ] After 1765 , growing constitutional and political differences strained the relationship between Great Britain and its American colonies . Patriot protests against taxation without representation followed the Stamp Act and escalated into boycotts , which culminated in 1773 with the Sons of Liberty destroying a shipment of tea in Boston Harbor . Britain responded by closing Boston Harbor and passing a series of punitive measures against Massachusetts Bay Colony . Massachusetts colonists responded with the Suffolk Resolves , and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown . Twelve colonies formed a Continental Congress ( with the exception of Georgia ) to coordinate their resistance , establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power . British attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia in Concord led to open combat and a British defeat on April 19 , 1775 . Militia forces then besieged Boston , forcing a British evacuation in March 1776 , and Congress appointed George Washington to command the Continental Army . Concurrently , the Americans failed decisively in an attempt to invade Quebec and raise insurrection against the British . On July 2 , 1776 , the Second Continental Congress voted for independence , issuing its declaration on July 4 . Sir William Howe launched a British counter-offensive , capturing New York City and leaving American morale at a low ebb .

The British Army , however , lost a considerable number of men during the battle ( with estimates as high as 27% ) . The battle was the largest and most hotly contested action in the American Revolution 's southern theater , and led to the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown . Before the battle , the British had great success in conquering much of Georgia and South Carolina with the aid of strong Loyalist factions , and thought that North Carolina might be within their grasp . In fact , the British were in the process of heavy recruitment in North Carolina when this battle put an end to their recruiting drive . In the wake of the battle , Greene moved into South Carolina , while Cornwallis chose to march into Virginia and attempt to link up with roughly 3,500 men under British Major General Phillips and American turncoat Benedict Arnold . These decisions allowed Greene to unravel British control of the South , while leading Cornwallis to Yorktown and eventual surrender to General George Washington and Lieutenant General Comte de Rochambeau . The battle is commemorated at Guilford Courthouse National Military Park and associated Hoskins House Historic District .",
