  "/wiki/U.S._Route_20": "U.S. Route 20 or U.S. Highway 20 ( US 20 ) is an east-west United States highway that stretches from the Pacific Northwest all the way to New England . The 0 in its route number indicates that US 20 is a coast-to-coast route and major route . Spanning 3,365 miles ( 5,415 km ) , it is the longest road in the United States , and the route is roughly parallel to that of the newer Interstate 90 ( I-90 ) , which is in turn the longest Interstate Highway in the U.S . There is a discontinuity in the official designation of US 20 through Yellowstone National Park , with unnumbered roads used to traverse the park . US 20 and US 30 break the general U.S. Route numbering rules in Oregon , since US 30 actually starts north of US 20 in Astoria , and runs parallel to the north throughout the state ( the Columbia River and Interstate 84 ) . The two run concurrently and continue in the correct positioning near Caldwell , Idaho . This is because US 20 was not a planned coast-to-coast route while US 30 was . US 20 originally ended at the eastern entrance of Yellowstone Park ; it was extended in 1940 . The highway 's eastern terminus is in Boston , Massachusetts , at Kenmore Square , where it meets Route 2 . Its western terminus is in Newport , Oregon , at an intersection with US 101 , within a mile of the Pacific Ocean .",

  "/wiki/Snake_River": "The Snake River is a major river of the greater Pacific Northwest region in the United States . At 1,078 miles ( 1,735 km ) long , it is the largest tributary of the Columbia River , in turn the largest North American river that empties into the Pacific Ocean . The Snake River rises in western Wyoming , then flows through the Snake River Plain of southern Idaho , the rugged Hells Canyon on the Oregon-Idaho border and the rolling Palouse Hills of Washington , emptying into the Columbia River at the Tri-Cities , Washington . The Snake River drainage basin encompasses parts of six U.S. states and is known for its varied geologic history . The Snake River Plain was created by a volcanic hotspot which now lies underneath the Snake River headwaters in Yellowstone National Park . Gigantic glacial-retreat flooding episodes that occurred during the previous Ice Age carved out canyons , cliffs and waterfalls along the middle and lower Snake River . Two of these catastrophic flooding events , the Missoula Floods and Bonneville Flood , significantly affected the river and its surroundings . Prehistoric Native Americans lived along the Snake starting more than 11,000 years ago . Salmon from the Pacific Ocean spawned by the millions in the river , and were a vital resource for people living on the Snake downstream of Shoshone Falls . By the time Lewis and Clark explored the area , the Nez Perce and Shoshone were the dominant Native American groups in the region . Later explorers and fur trappers further changed and used the resources of the Snake River basin . At one point , sign language used by the Shoshones representing weaving baskets was misinterpreted to represent a snake , giving the Snake River its name .",
