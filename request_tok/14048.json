The film is a loose adaptation of the book The 120 Days of Sodom by the Marquis de Sade , set during World War II , and was Pasolini 's final film , being released three weeks after his murder . The film focuses on four wealthy , corrupt Italian libertines , in the time of the fascist Republic of Sal\u00f2 ( 1943-1945 ) . The libertines kidnap 18 teenagers and subject them to four months of extreme violence , murder , sadism and sexual and mental torture . The film explores the themes of political corruption , consumerism , capitalism , nihilism , morality , abuse of power , social darwinism , sadism , sexuality and fascism . The story is in four segments , inspired by Dante 's Divine Comedy : the Anteinferno , the Circle of Manias , the Circle of Excrement , and the Circle of Blood . The film also contains frequent references to and several discussions of Friedrich Nietzsche 's 1887 book On the Genealogy of Morality , Ezra Pound 's poem The Cantos , and Marcel Proust 's novel sequence In Search of Lost Time . Premiering at the Paris Film Festival on 23 November 1975 , the film had a brief theatrical run in Italy before being banned in January 1976 and was released in the United States the following year on 3 October 1977 . Because it depicts youths subjected to intensely graphic violence , relentless sadism , sexual deviance and brutal murder , the film was extremely controversial upon its release and has remained banned in several countries into the 21st century . The confluence of thematic content in the film - ranging from the political and socio-historical , to psychological and sexual - has led to much critical discussion of the film . It has been both praised and decried by various film historians and critics and was named the 65th scariest film ever made by the Chicago Film Critics Association in 2006 . It is also the subject of an entry in The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural ( 1986 ) .",
