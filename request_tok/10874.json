There are also several unsigned segments of MD 18 scattered along the length of the signed portions . What is now MD 18 was first paved in the 1910s from Centreville to Queenstown along with short segments in Grasonville and Chester . Gaps in the Stevensville-Queenstown highway were filled throughout the 1920s , leaving only a crossing of Kent Narrows to be completed in the early 1930s . MD 18 between Stevensville and Love Point was constructed in the early 1930s . The Stevensville-Queenstown highway was designated part of MD 404 , while the highways on both ends to Love Point and Centreville were designated MD 18 . US 50 replaced MD 404 when the former highway was extended east of Annapolis in 1949 . When US 50 was relocated as a divided highway between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Queenstown in the early 1950s , MD 18 was assigned to the bypassed highway . Since the mid-1980s , several suffixed sections of MD 18 have been created , relocated , or received new designations due to expansion of US 50 and US 301 to a freeway .",
