  "/wiki/House_of_Stuart": "The House of Stuart , originally Stewart , was a European royal house of Scotland , with historical connections to Brittany . The family name itself comes from the office of High Steward of Scotland , which had been held by the family scion Walter fitz Alan ( c. 1150 ) . The name Stewart and variations had become established as a family name by the time of his grandson , Walter Stewart . The first monarch of the Stewart line was Robert II whose descendants were kings and queens of Scotland from 1371 until the union with England in 1707 . Mary , Queen of Scots was brought up in France where she adopted the French spelling of the name Stuart . In 1503 , James IV married Margaret Tudor , thus linking the royal houses of Scotland and England . Elizabeth I of England died without issue in 1603 , and James IV 's great grandson James VI of Scotland succeeded to the thrones of England and Ireland as James I in the Union of the Crowns . The Stuarts were monarchs of Britain and Ireland and its growing empire until the death of Queen Anne in 1714 , except for the period of the Commonwealth between 1649 and 1660 . [ note 3 ] In total , nine Stewart/Stuart monarchs ruled Scotland alone from 1371 until 1603 , the last of which was James VI , before his accession in England . Two Stuart queens ruled the isles following the Glorious Revolution in 1688 : Mary II and Anne . Both were the Protestant daughters of James VII and II by his first wife Anne Hyde and the great-grandchildren of James VI and I . Their father had converted to Catholicism and his new wife gave birth to a son in 1688 , who was brought up a Roman Catholic and preceded his half-sisters ; so James was deposed by Parliament in 1689 , in favour of his daughters .",

The ranks of the English peerage are , in descending order , Duke , Marquess , Earl , Viscount , and Baron . While most newer English peerages descend only in the male line , many of the older ones ( particularly older baronies ) can descend through females .

Membership was once an entitlement of all hereditary peers , other than those in the peerage of Ireland , but under the House of Lords Act 1999 , the right to membership was restricted to 92 hereditary peers .

  "/wiki/Duke_of_York": "Duke of York is a title of nobility in the Peerage of the United Kingdom . Since the 15th century , it has , when granted , usually been given to the second son of English ( later British ) monarchs . The equivalent title in the Scottish peerage was Duke of Albany .

Initially granted in the 14th century in the Peerage of England , the title Duke of York has been created eight times . The title Duke of York and Albany has been created three times . These occurred during the 18th century , following the 1707 unification of the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland into a single , united realm . The double naming was done so that a territorial designation from each of the previously separate realms could be included . The current Duke of York is Prince Andrew , the second son of Queen Elizabeth II . The present Duke 's marriage produced two daughters only , and he has remained unmarried since his 1996 divorce .
