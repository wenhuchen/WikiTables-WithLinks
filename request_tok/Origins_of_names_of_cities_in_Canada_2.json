  "/wiki/Brandon_House": "Brandon House was a Hudson 's Bay Company post or posts from 1793 to 1824 . It was located at several places on the Assiniboine River between Brandon , Manitoba and the mouth of the Souris River about 21 miles southeast of Brandon . Because of its location near the Souris River it was a center for trade with the Mandans in North Dakota . It was moved four times and there were related forts nearby , so its history is necessarily complex . For background see Assiniboine River fur trade . Around 1750 a French missionary lived in the area . Before 1793 there were ill-documented independent traders in the area and perhaps in 1793 a small post was established two miles upstream from the Souris by Ronald Cameron , a clerk to Peter Grant .",

  "/wiki/Portage": "Portage or portaging ( Canada : /p\u0254\u02d0r\u02c8t\u0251\u02d0\u0292/ ; US : /\u02c8p\u0254\u02d0rt\u0259d\u0292/ ) is the practice of carrying water craft or cargo over land , either around an obstacle in a river , or between two bodies of water . A path where items are regularly carried between bodies of water is also called a portage . Early French explorers in New France and French Louisiana encountered many rapids and cascades . The Native Americans carried their canoes over land to avoid river obstacles . Over time , important portages were sometimes provided with canals with locks , and even portage railways . Primitive portaging generally involves carrying the vessel and its contents across the portage in multiple trips . Small canoes can be portaged by carrying them inverted over one 's shoulders and the center strut may be designed in the style of a yoke to facilitate this . Historically , voyageurs often employed tump lines on their heads to carry loads on their backs . Portages can be many kilometers in length , such as the 19-kilometre ( 12 mi ) Methye Portage and the 8.5-mile ( 13.7 km ) Grand Portage ( both in North America ) often covering hilly or difficult terrain . Some portages involve very little elevation change , such as the very short Mavis Grind in Shetland , which crosses an isthmus .",

Its main tributaries are the Qu'Appelle , Souris and Whitesand Rivers . For early history and exploration see Assiniboine River fur trade . The river takes its name from the Assiniboine First Nation . Robert Douglas of the Geographical Board of Canada ( 1933 ) made several comments as to its origin : The name commemorates the Assiniboine natives called by La V\u00e9rendrye in 1730 'Assiniboils ' and by Governor Knight in 1715 of the Hudson 's Bay Company 'stone Indians . ' Assiniboine is the name of an Indian tribe and is derived from 'assine ' a stone and 'bwan ' native name of the Sioux , hence Stony Sioux name was possibly given because they used heated stones in cooking their food .",

  "/wiki/Plautdietsch_language": "Plautdietsch ( IPA : [ /pla\u028at.dit\u0283/ ] ) , Plauttdietsch or Mennonite Low German , is a Low Prussian dialect of East Low German with Dutch influence that developed in the 16th and 17th centuries in the Vistula delta area of Royal Prussia . The word Plautdietsch translates to flat ( or low ) German , from plaut ( or plautt ) meaning flat ( referring to the plains of northern Germany or the simplicity of the language ) , and dietsch meaning German . In other Low German dialects , the word for Low German is usually realised as Plattd\u00fctsch/Plattd\u00fc\u00fctsch [ \u02c8platdy\u02d0t\u0283 ] or Plattd\u00fc\u00fctsk [ \u02c8platdy\u02d0tsk ] , but the spelling Plautdietsch ( or Plauttdietsch ) is used to refer specifically to the Vistula variant of the language . Plautdietsch , an East Low German dialect , was a German dialect like others until it was taken by Mennonite settlers to the southwest of the Russian Empire starting in 1789 . From there it evolved and subsequent waves of migration brought it to North America , starting in 1873 , and mostly from there to Latin America starting in 1922 . Plautdietsch is spoken by about 400,000 Russian Mennonites , most notably in the Latin American countries of Mexico , Bolivia , Paraguay , Belize , Brazil , Argentina and Uruguay , as well as in the United States and Canada ( particularly Manitoba , Saskatchewan and Ontario ) . Today Plautdietsch is spoken in two major dialects that trace their division to Ukraine . These two dialects are split between Chortitza Colony and Molotschna . Many younger Russian Mennonites in Canada and the United States today speak only English . For example , Homer Groening , the father of Matt Groening ( creator of The Simpsons ) , spoke Plautdietsch as a child in a Mennonite community in Saskatchewan in the 1920s , but Matt never learned the language . In 2007 , Mexican filmmaker Carlos Reygadas directed the film Stellet Licht ( Silent Light ) , set in a Mennonite community in Chihuahua , Mexico . Most of the film 's dialogue is in Plautdietsch , which some of the actors had to learn phonetically .",
