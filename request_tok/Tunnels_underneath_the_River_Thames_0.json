It remains the furthest tunnel downstream on the Thames . Completed in 1970 at a cost of around \u00a33 million ( equivalent to \u00a347 million in 2019 ) by the Central Electricity Generating Board , the tunnel carries 400 kV transmission cables between substations at Tilbury and Kingsnorth as part of the National Grid . The tunnel is approximately 45m deep , and was one of the first tunnels in the UK to be lined with pre-cast concrete segments rather than cast iron . A tunnel was chosen due to the high costs of building an overhead transmission line at this point in the river .",

  "/wiki/Dartford_Crossing": "The Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing , commonly known as the Dartford Crossing and until 1991 the Dartford Tunnel , is a major road crossing of the River Thames in England , carrying the A282 road between Dartford in Kent in the south and Thurrock in Essex in the north . It consists of two bored tunnels and the cable-stayed Queen Elizabeth II Bridge . The only fixed road crossing of the Thames east of Greater London , it is the busiest estuarial crossing in the United Kingdom , with an average daily use of over 130,000 vehicles . It opened in stages : the west tunnel in 1963 , the east tunnel in 1980 and the bridge in 1991 . The crossing , although not officially designated a motorway , is considered part of the M25 motorway 's route , using the tunnels northbound and bridge southbound . Described as one of the most important road crossings in Britain , it suffers from heavy traffic and congestion . The crossing 's development started in the late 1930s , but was interrupted due to the Second World War and resumed in the 1950s . The original tunnel catered for a single lane of traffic in each direction , but rising traffic levels required the second tunnel to be built . The M25 connected to the tunnels at both ends when completed in 1986 , and this increased traffic put pressure on the tunnels ' capacity . A Private Finance Initiative scheme was started in 1988 to build the bridge . The combined crossing now handles four lanes of traffic in each direction . The crossing had always been tolled , and from 1 April 2003 this became a charge , though since 2008 it has been free from 10 pm to 6 am .",

  "/wiki/Blackwall_Tunnel": "The Blackwall Tunnel is a pair of road tunnels underneath the River Thames in east London , England linking the London Borough of Tower Hamlets with the Royal Borough of Greenwich , and part of the A102 road . The northern portal lies just south of the East India Dock Road ( A13 ) in Blackwall ; A the southern entrances are just south of The O2 on the Greenwich Peninsula.B The road is managed by Transport for London ( TfL ) . The tunnel was originally opened as a single bore in 1897 by the then Prince of Wales , as a major transport project to improve commerce and trade in London 's East End , and supported a mix of foot , cycle , horse-drawn and vehicular traffic . By the 1930s , capacity was becoming inadequate , and consequently a second bore opened in 1967 , handling southbound traffic while the earlier 19th century tunnel handled northbound . The northern approach takes traffic from the A12 and the southern approach takes traffic from the A2 , making the tunnel crossing a key link for both local and longer-distance traffic between the north and south sides of the river . It forms part of a key route into Central London from South East London and Kent and was the easternmost all-day crossing for vehicles before the opening of the Dartford Tunnel in 1963 . It remains the easternmost free fixed road crossing of the Thames , and regularly suffers congestion , to the extent that tidal flow schemes were in place from 1978 until controversially removed in 2007 . Proposals to solve the traffic problems have included building a third bore , constructing alternative crossings of the Thames such as the now cancelled Thames Gateway Bridge or the Silvertown Tunnel , and providing better traffic management , particularly for heavy goods vehicles .

Greenwich is notable for its maritime history and for giving its name to the Greenwich Meridian ( 0\u00b0 longitude ) and Greenwich Mean Time . The town became the site of a royal palace , the Palace of Placentia from the 15th century , and was the birthplace of many Tudors , including Henry VIII and Elizabeth I . The palace fell into disrepair during the English Civil War and was demolished to be replaced by the Royal Naval Hospital for Sailors , designed by Sir Christopher Wren and his assistant Nicholas Hawksmoor .

The historic rooms within these buildings remain open to the public ; other buildings are used by University of Greenwich and Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance . The town became a popular resort in the 18th century and many grand houses were built there , such as Vanbrugh Castle ( 1717 ) established on Maze Hill , next to the park . From the Georgian period estates of houses were constructed above the town centre .

Rotherhithe is located 4.5 km ( 2.8 mi ) east of London 's centre point .",
  "/wiki/Limehouse": "Limehouse is a district in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in East London . It is 3.9 miles ( 6.3 km ) east of Charing Cross , on the northern bank of the River Thames . Its proximity to the river has given it a strong maritime character , which it retains through its riverside public houses and steps , such as The Grapes and Limehouse Stairs . It was part of the traditional county of Middlesex , but became part of the County of London following the passing of the Local Government Act 1888 , and then part of Greater London in 1965 . It is located between Stepney to the west and north , Mile End and Bow to the northwest , Poplar to the east , and Canary Wharf and Millwall to the south , and stretches from the end of Cable Street and Butcher Row in the west to Stainsby Road near Bartlett Park in the east , and from West India Dock ( South Dock ) and the River Thames in the south to Salmon Lane and Rhodeswell Road in the north . The area gives its name to Limehouse Reach , a section of the Thames which runs south to Millwall after making a right-angled bend at Cuckold 's Point , Rotherhithe . The west-to-east section upstream of Cuckold 's Point is properly called the Lower Pool .",
  "/wiki/Thames_Tunnel": "The Thames Tunnel is an underwater tunnel , built beneath the River Thames in London , connecting Rotherhithe and Wapping . It measures 35 feet ( 11 m ) wide by 20 feet ( 6 m ) high and is 1,300 feet ( 396 m ) long , running at a depth of 75 feet ( 23 m ) below the river surface measured at high tide . It was the first tunnel known to have been constructed successfully underneath a navigable river and was built between 1825 and 1843 using Marc Isambard Brunel 's and Thomas Cochrane 's newly invented tunnelling shield technology , by Brunel and his son Isambard Kingdom Brunel . The tunnel was originally designed for horse-drawn carriages but instead was used by pedestrians and became a tourist attraction . In 1869 it was converted into a railway tunnel as part of the East London line which , since 2010 , is part of the London Overground railway network under the ownership of Transport for London .",

  "/wiki/Tower_Subway": "The Tower Subway is a tunnel beneath the River Thames in central London , between Tower Hill on the north side of the river and Vine Lane ( off Tooley Street ) on the south . In 1869 a 1,340-foot ( 410 m ) circular tunnel was dug through the London clay using a cast iron shield , an idea that had been patented in 1864 by Peter W. Barlow but never built . A 2 ft 6 in ( 762 mm ) narrow gauge railway was laid in the tunnel and from August 1870 a cable-hauled wooden carriage conveyed passengers from one end to the other . This was uneconomic and the company went bankrupt by the end of the year . The tunnel was converted to pedestrian use and one million people a year crossed under the river , paying a toll of \u200b1\u20442d . The opening of the toll-free Tower Bridge in 1894 caused a drop in income and the tunnel closed in 1898 , after being sold to the London Hydraulic Power Company . Today the tunnel is used for water mains . The same shield method of construction was used in 1890 to dig the tunnels of the City and South London Railway , the first of London 's electrified Tube railways and the first underground electrified railway in the world .",

  "/wiki/Northern_line": "The Northern line is a London Underground line that runs from south-west to north-west London , with two branches through central London and three in north London . It runs northwards from its southern terminus at Morden in the borough of Merton to Kennington in Southwark , where it divides into two central branches , one via Charing Cross in the West End and the other via Bank in the City . The central branches re-join at Camden Town where the line again divides into two branches , one to High Barnet and the other to Edgware in the borough of Barnet . The High Barnet branch has an additional single-station spur at Finchley Central with a shuttle train to Mill Hill East . For most of its length it is a deep-level tube line . [ nb 1 ] The portion between Stockwell and Borough opened in 1890 and is the oldest section of deep-level tube line on the Underground network . About 294 million passenger journeys were recorded in 2016/17 on the Northern line , making it the busiest on the Underground . It is unique in having two different routes through central London and two northern branches . Despite its name , it does not serve the northernmost stations on the network , though it does serve the southernmost station , Morden , as well as 16 of the system 's 29 stations south of the River Thames . There are 50 stations in total on the line , of which 36 have platforms below ground . The line has a complicated history , and the current complex arrangement of two main northern branches , two central branches and the southern route reflects its genesis as three separate railways , combined in the 1920s and 1930s . An extension in the 1920s used a route originally planned by a fourth company .",
  "/wiki/London_Bridge_station": "London Bridge is a central London railway terminus and connected London Underground station in Southwark , south-east London . It occupies a large area on three levels immediately south-east of London Bridge , from which it takes its name . The main line station is the oldest railway station in London fare zone 1 and one of the oldest in the world having opened in 1836 . It is one of two main line termini in London to the south of the River Thames ( the other being Waterloo ) and is the fourth-busiest station in London , handling over 50 million customers a year . The station was originally opened by the London and Greenwich Railway as a local service . It subsequently served the London and Croydon Railway , the London and Brighton Railway and the South Eastern Railway , thus becoming an important London terminus . It was rebuilt in 1849 and again in 1864 to provide more services and increase capacity . Local services from London Bridge began to be electrified in the beginning of the 20th century , and had spread to national routes by the 1930s . The station was extensively rebuilt by British Rail during the 1970s , along with a comprehensive re-signalling scheme and track alignment . It was further redeveloped in the 2010s to better accommodate the Thameslink route which provides a connection to Gatwick Airport , Luton Airport and Crossrail . London Bridge is served by Southeastern services from Charing Cross and Cannon Street to destinations in southeast London , Kent and East Sussex and is a terminus for many Southern commuter and regional services to south London and numerous destinations in South East England . Thameslink services from Bedford , Cambridge and Peterborough to Brighton and other destinations in Sussex and Kent began serving the station in 2018 .",
