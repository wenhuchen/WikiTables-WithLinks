He has described his mental strength and physical fitness as his greatest abilities as a skier , with his main weakness being a lack of sprinting ability . Wassberg won four Olympic gold medals : in 15 km ( 1980 ) , 50 km ( 1984 ) , and the 4 \u00d7 10 km relay ( 1984 , 1988 ) , and served as the Olympic flag bearer for Sweden in 1988 .

At the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid , Wassberg edged out Finland 's Juha Mieto by 0.01 seconds in the 15 km , the closest cross-country ski race in Olympic history . Wassberg subsequently suggested to Mieto that the gold medal should be split between them as one one-hundredth of a second is nothing in a 15-kilometer race . This incident led the International Ski Federation ( FIS ) to change their timing to the nearest one-tenth of a second . It also resulted in an apocryphal urban legend that Wassberg and Mieto 's medals were cut in half and re-welded into half-gold , half-silver medals . At the 1984 Winter Olympics , Wassberg beat out fellow Swede Gunde Svan by 4.9 seconds in the 50 km , the closest margin of victory ever in that event until Giorgio Di Centa edged out Yevgeny Dementyev by 0.8 seconds at the 2006 Winter Olympics though the 2006 event was a mass start event while the 1984 event was an interval start event .",
