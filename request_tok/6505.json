It was released in theaters in North America as just Azur & Asmar . It is Ocelot 's fourth feature , though his first wholly original creation since Kirikou and the Sorceress , and his first use of 3D computer graphics , albeit an atypical employment of this medium with two-dimensional , painted backgrounds and non-photorealistic rendering . Like most of his films it is an original fairy tale , in this case inspired by the folklore ( such as the One Thousand and One Nights ) and decorative art of North Africa and the Middle East and with an increased degree of characterisation relative to his previous works which pushes it into the genre of fairytale fantasy . The original-language version of the film has significant amounts of dialogue in both French and Classical Arabic ; however , the Arabic was not subtitled in the original French theatrical release and is not indented to be subtitled nor replaced for any other audiences .",
