This conventional invasion ( the largest offensive operation since 300,000 Chinese troops had crossed the Yalu River into North Korea during the Korean War ) was a radical departure from previous North Vietnamese offensives . The offensive was not designed to win the war outright but to gain as much territory and destroy as many units of the ARVN as possible , to improve the North 's negotiating position as the Paris Peace Accords drew towards a conclusion . The U.S. high command had been expecting an attack in 1972 but the size and ferocity of the assault caught the defenders off balance , because the attackers struck on three fronts simultaneously , with the bulk of the North Vietnamese army . This first attempt by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam ( North Vietnam ) to invade the south since the Tet Offensive of 1968 , became characterized by conventional infantry-armor assaults backed by heavy artillery , with both sides fielding the latest in technological advances in weapons systems . In the I Corps Tactical Zone , North Vietnamese forces overran South Vietnamese defensive positions in a month-long battle and captured Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb city , before moving south in an attempt to seize Hu\u1ebf . PAVN similarly eliminated frontier defense forces in the II Corps Tactical Zone and advanced to seize the provincial capital of Kon Tum , which would have opened the way to the sea , splitting South Vietnam in two . North-east of Saigon , in the III Corps Tactical Zone , PAVN forces overran L\u1ed9c Ninh and advanced to assault the capital of B\u00ecnh Long Province at An L\u1ed9c . The campaign can be divided into three phases : April was a month of PAVN advances ; May became a period of equilibrium ; in June and July the South Vietnamese forces counter-attacked , culminating in the recapture of Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb City in September . On all three fronts , initial North Vietnamese successes were hampered by high casualties , inept tactics and the increasing application of U.S. and South Vietnamese air power . One result of the offensive was the launching of Operation Linebacker , the first sustained bombing of North Vietnam by the U.S. since November 1968 . Although South Vietnamese forces withstood their greatest trial thus far in the conflict , the North Vietnamese accomplished two important goals : they had gained valuable territory within South Vietnam from which to launch future offensives and they had obtained a better bargaining position at the peace negotiations being conducted in Paris .",

The A-7 was developed during the early 1960s as replacement for the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk . Its design is derived from the Vought F-8 Crusader ; in comparison with the F-8 , the A-7 is both smaller and restricted to subsonic speeds , its airframe being simpler and cheaper to produce . Following a competitive bid by Vought in response to the United States Navy 's ( USN ) VAL ( Heavier-than-air , Attack , Light ) requirement , an initial contract for the type was issued on 8 February 1964 . Development was rapid , first flying on 26 September 1965 and entering squadron service with the USN on 1 February 1967 ; by the end of that year , A-7s were being deployed overseas for the Vietnam War . Initially adopted by USN , the A-7 proved attractive to other services , soon being adopted by the United States Air Force ( USAF ) and the Air National Guard ( ANG ) to replace their aging Douglas A-1 Skyraider and North American F-100 Super Sabre fleets . Improved models of the A-7 would be developed , typically adopting more powerful engines and increasingly capable avionics . American A-7s would be used in various major conflicts , including the Invasion of Grenada , Operation El Dorado Canyon , and the Gulf War . The type was also used to support the development of the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk . The A-7 was also exported to Greece in the 1970s and to Portugal in the late 1980s .

It was designed as a successor for multiple existing medium-sized attack aircraft , such as the piston-engined Douglas A-1 Skyraider . Unlike its predecessors , and even some contemporaries , the A-6 made extensive use of interconnected avionics . Operated by a crew of two in a side-by-side seating configuration , the workload were divided between the pilot and weapons officer . In addition to conventional munitions , the type was also compatible with the Navy 's air-based nuclear weapons , which were deployable via a toss bombing techniques .

The A-6 was in service with the United States Navy and Marine Corps between 1963 and 1997 , multiple variants of the type being introduced during this time . From the A-6 , a specialized electronic warfare derivative , the EA-6B Prowler , was developed . It was deployed during various overseas conflicts , including the Vietnam War and the Gulf War . The A-6 was intended to be succeeded by the McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II , but this program was ultimately terminated canceled , allegedly due to cost overruns .

Unlike the Operation Rolling Thunder and Operation Linebacker interdiction operations , Linebacker II was to be a maximum effort bombing campaign to destroy major target complexes in the Hanoi and Haiphong areas , which could only be accomplished by B-52s . It saw the largest heavy bomber strikes launched by the U.S. Air Force since the end of World War II . Linebacker II was a modified extension of the Operation Linebacker bombings conducted from May to October , when the emphasis of the new campaign shifted to attacks by B-52s rather than smaller tactical fighter aircraft .",
  "/wiki/Paris_Peace_Talks": "The Paris Peace Accords , ( Vietnamese : Hi\u1ec7p \u0111\u1ecbnh Paris v\u1ec1 Vi\u1ec7t Nam ) officially titled the Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet Nam ( Hi\u1ec7p \u0111\u1ecbnh v\u1ec1 ch\u1ea5m d\u1ee9t chi\u1ebfn tranh , l\u1eadp l\u1ea1i h\u00f2a b\u00ecnh \u1edf Vi\u1ec7t Nam ) , was a peace treaty signed on January 27 , 1973 , to establish peace in Vietnam and end the Vietnam War . The treaty included the governments of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam ( North Vietnam ) , the Republic of Vietnam ( South Vietnam ) , and the United States , as well as the Provisional Revolutionary Government ( PRG ) that represented indigenous South Vietnamese revolutionaries . US ground forces up to that point had been sidelined with deteriorating morale and gradually withdrawn to coastal regions , not partaking in offensive operations or much direct combat for the preceding two-year period . The Paris Agreement Treaty would in effect remove all remaining US Forces , including air and naval forces in exchange for Hanoi 's POWs . Direct U.S. military intervention was ended , and fighting between the three remaining powers temporarily stopped for less than a day . The agreement was not ratified by the United States Senate . The negotiations that led to the accord began in 1968 , after various lengthy delays . As a result of the accord , the International Control Commission ( ICC ) was replaced by the International Commission of Control and Supervision ( ICCS ) to fulfill the agreement . The main negotiators of the agreement were United States National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger and North Vietnamese politburo member L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecd ; the two men were awarded the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts , although L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecd refused to accept it . The agreement 's provisions were immediately and frequently broken by both North and South Vietnamese forces with no official response from the United States . The North Vietnamese accused the United States of conducting bombing operations in the North of Vietnam during this time . Open fighting broke out in March 1973 , and North Vietnamese offenses enlarged their control by the end of the year ."
