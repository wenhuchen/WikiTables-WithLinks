  "intro": "The Seventy-fifth United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met in Washington, DC from January 3, 1937, to January 3, 1939, during the first two years of the second administration of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. (Because of the 20th amendment, starting in 1937 the new Presidential term began 17 days after that of the new Congress). The apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives was based on the Fifteenth United States Census, conducted in 1930. Both chambers had a Democratic supermajority."
