  "/wiki/Boathouse": "A boathouse ( or a boat house ) is a building especially designed for the storage of boats , normally smaller craft for sports or leisure use . These are typically located on open water , such as on a river . Often the boats stored are rowing boats . Other boats such as punts or small motor boats may also be stored . Sometimes , a boathouse may be the headquarters of a boat club or rowing club . It may also include a restaurant , bar , and other leisure facilities , perhaps for members of an associated club . Boathouses are also sometimes modified to include living quarters for people , or the whole structure may be used as temporary or permanent housing . In Scandinavia , the boathouse is known as a naust , a word deriving from Old Norse naversta\u00f0 . These were typically built with stone walls and timber roofs and would be either open to the sea or provided with sturdy doors . The floors would be a simple continuation of the beach sand or rock , or they might be dug down to permit a boat to sail into the boathouse . The boathouse is also seen in reversides or lake sides . The boathouse is usually seen in Jammu & Kashmir India and many more places",

The style is usually marked by horizontal lines , flat or hipped roofs with broad overhanging eaves , windows grouped in horizontal bands , integration with the landscape , solid construction , craftsmanship , and discipline in the use of ornament . Horizontal lines were thought to evoke and relate to the wide , flat , treeless expanses of America 's native prairie landscape . The Prairie School was an attempt at developing an indigenous North American style of architecture in symphony with the ideals and design aesthetics of the Arts and Crafts Movement , with which it shared an embrace of handcrafting and craftsman guilds as an antidote to the dehumanizing effects of mass production . The term Prairie School was not actually used by practitioners of the style . Architect Marion Mahony , for example , preferred the phrase The Chicago Group . Its term was coined by H. Allen Brooks , one of the first architectural historians to write extensively about the movement and its work .",

  "/wiki/Woodland_Period": "In the classification of archaeological cultures of North America , the Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures spanned a period from roughly 1000 BCE to European contact in the eastern part of North America , with some archaeologists distinguishing the Mississippian period , from 1000 CE to European contact as a separate period . The term Woodland Period was introduced in the 1930s as a generic term for prehistoric sites falling between the Archaic hunter-gatherers and the agriculturalist Mississippian cultures . The Eastern Woodlands cultural region covers what is now eastern Canada south of the Subarctic region , the Eastern United States , along to the Gulf of Mexico . This period is variously considered a developmental stage , a time period , a suite of technological adaptations or traits , and a family tree of cultures related to earlier Archaic cultures . It can be characterized as a chronological and cultural manifestation without any massive changes in a short time but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools , leather crafting , textile manufacture , cultivation , and shelter construction . Many Woodland peoples used spears and atlatls until the end of the period , when they were replaced by bows and arrows ; however , Southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns . The most cited technological distinction of this period was the widespread use of pottery ( although pottery manufacture had arisen during the Archaic period in some places ) , and the diversification of pottery forms , decorations , and manufacturing practices . The increasing use of horticulture and the development of the Eastern Agricultural Complex , consisting of weedy seed plants as well as gourd cultivation , also meant that groups became less mobile over time and , in some times and places , people lived in permanently occupied villages and cities . Intensive agriculture characterizes the Mississippian period from c. 1000-1400 CE and may have continued up to European contact , around 500 years ago .",

In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings .

  "/wiki/Renaissance_Revival_architecture": "Renaissance Revival architecture ( sometimes referred to as Neo-Renaissance ) is a group of 19th century architectural revival styles which were neither Greek Revival nor Gothic Revival but which instead drew inspiration from a wide range of classicizing Italian modes . Under the broad designation Renaissance architecture nineteenth-century architects and critics went beyond the architectural style which began in Florence and central Italy in the early 15th century as an expression of Renaissance humanism ; they also included styles we would identify as Mannerist or Baroque . Self-applied style designations were rife in the mid- and later nineteenth century : Neo-Renaissance might be applied by contemporaries to structures that others called Italianate , or when many French Baroque features are present ( Second Empire ) . The divergent forms of Renaissance architecture in different parts of Europe , particularly in France and Italy , has added to the difficulty of defining and recognizing Neo-Renaissance architecture . A comparison between the breadth of its source material , such as the English Wollaton Hall , Italian Palazzo Pitti , the French Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord , and the Russian Palace of Facets - all deemed Renaissance - illustrates the variety of appearances the same architectural label can take .",

  "/wiki/Tuberculosis": "Tuberculosis ( TB ) is an infectious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( MTB ) bacteria . Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs , but can also affect other parts of the body . Most infections do not have symptoms , in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis .

The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing mucus , fever , night sweats , and weight loss . It was historically called consumption due to the weight loss . Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms . Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough , spit , speak , or sneeze . People with latent TB do not spread the disease . Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke .

The style later became an influence elsewhere , especially the British colonies . For example , in New Zealand , the architect Francis Petre adapted the style for the local climate . In Singapore , then a British colony , architects such as R. A. J. Bidwell pioneered what became known as the Black and White House . The earliest examples of the style originate with the works of such eminent architects as Norman Shaw and George Devey , in what at the time was thought Neo-Tudor design . Tudorbethan is a subset of Tudor Revival architecture that eliminated some of the more complex aspects of Jacobethan in favor of more domestic styles of Merrie England , which were cosier and quaint . It was associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement ."
