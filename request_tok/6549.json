  "/wiki/Monty_Python": "Monty Python ( also collectively known as the Pythons ) were a British surreal comedy group who created the sketch comedy television show Monty Python 's Flying Circus , which first aired on the BBC in 1969 . Forty-five episodes were made over four series . The Python phenomenon developed from the television series into something larger in scope and impact , including touring stage shows , films , numerous albums , several books and musicals . The Pythons ' influence on comedy has been compared to the Beatles ' influence on music . Regarded as an enduring icon of 1970s pop culture , their sketch show has been referred to as being an important moment in the evolution of television comedy . Broadcast by the BBC between 1969 and 1974 , Monty Python 's Flying Circus was conceived , written and performed by its members Graham Chapman , John Cleese , Terry Gilliam , Eric Idle , Terry Jones , and Michael Palin . Loosely structured as a sketch show , but with an innovative stream-of-consciousness approach aided by Gilliam 's animation , it pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable in style and content . A self-contained comedy team responsible for both writing and performing their work , the Pythons had creative control which allowed them to experiment with form and content , discarding rules of television comedy . Following their television work , they began making films , including Monty Python and the Holy Grail ( 1975 ) , Life of Brian ( 1979 ) and The Meaning of Life ( 1983 ) . Their influence on British comedy has been apparent for years , while in North America , it has coloured the work of cult performers from the early editions of Saturday Night Live through to more recent absurdist trends in television comedy . Pythonesque has entered the English lexicon as a result . At the 41st British Academy Film Awards in 1988 , Monty Python received the BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Contribution To Cinema .",
