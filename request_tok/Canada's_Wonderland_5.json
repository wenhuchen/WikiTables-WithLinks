  "/wiki/Dragon_Fyre_(roller_coaster)": "Dragon Fyre is a steel roller coaster located at Canada 's Wonderland in Vaughan , Ontario , Canada . It was manufactured in 1980 but opened when the park made its debut in 1981 . It operated under the name Dragon Fyre from 1981 to 1997 , when it was respelled to Dragon Fire . The name was quietly reverted to the original name in 2019 . It was one of the four original coasters at Canada 's Wonderland . The ride is built at the east end of the park in the Medieval Faire section . It is located adjacent to the parking lot , so it is one of the first coasters that is seen . The coaster has a green and yellow track with purple support poles . Since the removal of Drachen Fire from Busch Gardens Williamsburg , Dragon Fyre is also the only Arrow Dynamics coaster in existence to have counterclockwise-turning corkscrews . Dragon Fyre was designed to operate with three trains , which is made evident by the fact that the ride has a set of safety brakes following the corkscrews and before the helix . However , due to the ride 's short duration , it would be very difficult for the ride staff to load a train in the station without having one train stop in the middle of the ride . Because of this , Dragon Fyre never used its third train .",
  "/wiki/Arrow_Dynamics": "Arrow Dynamics was an American manufacturing and engineering company that specialized in designing and building amusement park rides , especially roller coasters . Based in Clearfield , Utah , the company was the successor to Arrow Development ( 1946-1981 ) and Arrow Huss ( 1981-1986 ) , which were responsible for several influential advancements in the amusement and theme park industries . Among the most significant was tubular steel track , which provided a smoother ride than the railroad style rails commonly used prior to the 1960s on wooden roller coasters . The Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland , built in 1959 , was Arrow 's first roller coaster project . In 1975 , Arrow Development introduced the first corkscrew style track Corkscrew , at Knott 's Berry Farm that sent riders through a series of corkscrews . Arrow created several other firsts over the years , introducing the first suspended roller coaster in almost a century , The Bat , in 1981 , and the world 's first hypercoaster , Magnum XL-200 , which opened in 1989 . They built the first 4th Dimension roller coaster , X2 , which was designed by Alan Schilke in 2002 . Arrow Development 's ownership changed three times between the 1950s and 1980s . Arrow Dynamics would eventually survive two bankruptcies and spin off a sister company , Fabriweld , primarily to build track , by 1988 . Arrow Dynamics eventually closed on December 3 , 2001 . S & S Worldwide purchased part of Arrow 's remaining assets on October 28 , 2002 , and the remainder of the company was dissolved .

  "/wiki/Drop_tower": "A drop tower or big drop is a type of amusement ride incorporating a central structure or tower . Drop towers vary in height , passenger capacity , lift type , and brake type . Many are custom-made , although there are some mass-produced designs . Riders experience free-fall initially , followed by rapid heavy deceleration . With most drop towers , a gondola carrying riders is lifted to the top of a large vertical structure , then released to free-fall down the tower . Brakes activate to slow the gondola as it approaches the bottom of the ride . Some designs expand on this concept with features such as rotating gondolas , or several bounces before coming to rest . Most drop towers require child riders to exceed a minimum height ; limits vary widely depending upon the nature of the tower , with a 30-foot ( 9 m ) tower for smaller children from 37 inches ( 95 cm ) tall , and a 115-foot ( 35 m ) tower having a 51-inch ( 130 cm ) restriction . Drop towers use a magnetic braking system to slow the carriage quickly and smoothly once it reaches the bottom of the tower . This system is fail-safe because magnets do not need to be powered by electricity or other sources ; they work intrinsically by the laws of magnetism .",

Typically , each set of six teacups has a center bearing mounted underneath , similar to a car wheel bearing mounted on a circular floor capable of turning 360\u00b0 . The circular floor of the cup sits on a larger turntable-like floor . This is driven by a motor through a starting device ; the ride when started begins to spin slowly and build up speed as the operator applies more power . When in operation , the ride operator spins each cup while the turntable spins the entire ride base . They are driven by a motor fixed to the base in either the middle or the outside , the motor fixed in the middle has a gearbox which changes direction , as well as gives the correct ratio to the desired speed . The motor fixed on the outside again has a gearbox , but is attached to a small rubber wheel which sits along the rim under the platform . Either way , the end result is achieved and under modern health and safety guidelines , children 's rides should not spin faster than eight times per minute . [ citation needed ]",

Settled in 1788 , the city is located at the northern side of the confluence of the Licking and Ohio rivers , the latter of which marks the state line with Kentucky .
