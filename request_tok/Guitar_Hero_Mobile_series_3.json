Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan ( lead vocals , guitar ) , D'arcy Wretzky ( bass ) , James Iha ( guitar ) , and Jimmy Chamberlin ( drums ) , the band has undergone many line-up changes . The current lineup features Corgan , Chamberlin , Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder . Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries , they have a diverse , densely layered , and guitar-heavy sound , containing elements of gothic rock , heavy metal , dream pop , psychedelic rock , progressive rock , shoegazing , and electronica in later recordings . Corgan is the group 's primary songwriter ; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band 's albums and songs , which have been described as anguished , bruised reports from Billy Corgan 's nightmare-land . The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album , 1993 's Siamese Dream . The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up , the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness , debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart . With 30 million albums sold worldwide , the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s . However , internal fighting , drug use , and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up . In 2006 , Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album , Zeitgeist . After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder , Chamberlin left the band in early 2009 . Later that year , Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope , which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles , compilation EP releases , and two full albums that also fell under the project 's scope - Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014 .",

Created following the McCartneys ' 1971 album Ram , the band 's first two albums , Wild Life ( 1971 ) and Red Rose Speedway ( 1973 ) ( the latter featuring guitarist Henry McCullough ) , were viewed as artistic disappointments beside Paul 's work with the Beatles . After the release of the title track of the James Bond movie Live and Let Die , McCullough and Seiwell resigned from the band . The McCartneys and Laine then released 1973 's Band on the Run , a commercial and critical success that spawned two top ten singles in Jet and the title track . Following that album , the band recruited guitarist Jimmy McCulloch and drummer Geoff Britton , only for Britton to quit shortly afterwards and be replaced by Joe English . With the new line-up , Wings released 1975 's Venus and Mars , which included the US number one single Listen to What the Man Said , and undertook a highly successful world tour over 1975-76 . Intended as more of a group effort , Wings at the Speed of Sound ( 1976 ) was issued midway through the tour and featured the hit singles Silly Love Songs and Let 'Em In . In 1977 , the band earned their only UK number one single , with Mull of Kintyre , which became the then-best-selling UK single in history .
