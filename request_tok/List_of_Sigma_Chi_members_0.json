  "/wiki/Bill_Buckner": "William Joseph Buckner ( December 14 , 1949 - May 27 , 2019 ) was an American professional baseball first baseman and left fielder , who played in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) for five teams from 1969 through 1990 , including the Chicago Cubs , the Los Angeles Dodgers , and Boston Red Sox . Beginning his career as an outfielder with the Dodgers , he helped the team to the 1974 pennant with a .314 batting average , but a serious ankle injury the next year eventually led to his trade to the Cubs prior to the 1977 season . The Cubs moved Buckner to first base , and he won the National League ( NL ) batting title with a .324 mark in 1980 . He was named to the All-Star team in 1981 as he led the major leagues in doubles . After setting a major league record for first basemen with 159 assists in 1982 , Buckner surpassed that total with 161 in 1983 while again leading the NL in doubles , before feuds with team management over a loss of playing time resulted in his being traded to the Red Sox in the middle of the 1984 season . During the 1985 season , Buckner emerged as the Red Sox stalwart first baseman , starting all 162 games and shattering his own big league record with 184 assists . Toward the end of the 1986 season , he was hobbled by leg injuries and struggled throughout the playoffs . Buckners tenth-inning error in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series against the New York Mets remains one of the most memorable plays in baseball history ; it was long considered part of a curse on the Red Sox that kept them from winning the World Series , and led to years of fan anger and public mockery that Buckner handled graciously before being embraced by Red Sox fans again after their 2004 World Series victory . After spending his last few seasons with the California Angels , Kansas City Royals , and a second stint with the Red Sox , Buckner became the 21st player in MLB history to play in four decades , ending his career with 2,715 hits and 498 doubles , having batted over .300 seven times with three seasons of 100 runs batted in ( RBI ) . Never striking out 40 times in a season , he finished with the fifth-lowest strikeout rate among players whose careers began after 1950 . Buckner led his league in assists four times , with his 1985 mark remaining the American League ( AL ) record , and retired with the fourth-most assists by a first baseman ( 1,351 ) in major league history , despite not playing the position regularly until he was 27 years old . After retiring as a player , he became a real estate developer in Idaho , and later coached a number of Minor League Baseball ( MiLB ) teams before leaving baseball in 2014 .",

The Red Sox were a dominant team in the new league , defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series in 1903 and winning four more championships by 1918 . However , they then went into one of the longest championship droughts in baseball history , dubbed the Curse of the Bambino after its alleged inception due to the Red Sox ' sale of Babe Ruth to the rival New York Yankees two years after their world championship in 1918 , an 86-year wait before the team 's sixth World Championship in 2004 .

The Los Angeles team had personnel connections to the Monarchs but could not use the Monarchs name . The name also fits into something of a theme for other professional sports franchises in the city , including the Kansas City Chiefs of the NFL , the former Kansas City Kings of the NBA , and the former Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro National League . In 1968 , the team held a name-the-team contest that received more than 17,000 entries .

  "/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_batting_champions": "In baseball , batting average ( AVG ) is a measure of a batter 's success rate in achieving a hit during an at bat . In Major League Baseball ( MLB ) , it is calculated by dividing a player 's hits by his at bats ( AB ) . In MLB , a player in each league [ L ] wins the batting title each season for having the highest batting average that year . The American League ( AL ) winner is known as the Rod Carew American League Batting Champion , while the National League ( NL ) leader is designated the Tony Gwynn National League Batting Champion . Under current rules , a player must have 3.1 plate appearances ( PA ) per team game ( for a total of 502 over the current 162-game season ) to qualify for the batting title . However , if a player 's lead in AVG is sufficiently large that enough hitless at bats can be added to reach this requirement and the player still would have the highest batting average , he wins the title . Tony Gwynn , for example , had 159 hits in 451 ABs in 1996 ( .353 average ) but only 498 PAs . Gwynn 's batting average would have dropped to .349 ( 159 hits in 455 ABs ) with four hitless ABs added to reach the 502 PA requirement , but this would still have been higher than the next-highest eligible player ( .344 average ) , so he was awarded the 1996 NL batting title . The first batting average champion in the NL was Ross Barnes ; in the league 's inaugural 1876 season , Barnes batted .429 for the Chicago White Stockings . The AL was established in 1901 , and Hall of Fame second baseman Nap Lajoie led that league with a .426 average for the Philadelphia Athletics . Ty Cobb of the Detroit Tigers , who also holds the highest career batting average of .366 , led the AL in average in 11 ( or 12 ) seasons . Honus Wagner and Gwynn are tied for the second-most titles , with eight apiece in the NL .",

It is sometimes called the Junior Circuit because it claimed Major League status for the 1901 season , 25 years after the formation of the National League ( the Senior Circuit ) . At the end of every season , the American League champion plays in the World Series against the National League champion ; two seasons did not end in playing a World Series ( 1904 , when the National League champion New York Giants refused to play their AL counterpart , and 1994 , when a players ' strike prevented the Series ) .

  "/wiki/MVP": "In sports , a most valuable player ( MVP ) award is an honor typically bestowed upon an individual as the most performing player ( or players ) in an entire league , for a particular competition , or on a specific team . Initially used in professional sports , the term is now also commonly used in amateur sports , as well as in other completely unrelated fields such as business and music . In many sports , MVP awards are presented for a specific match - in other words , a player of the match award . The term is most common in the United States and Canada . In other cases , player of the year is used for a season-spanning award and player of the match for individual games . In Australia , Australian rules football clubs and leagues use the term best and fairest , while those playing rugby league use player of the year , such as the Dally M Medal . The National Basketball League , however , uses the American-style MVP for its awards . In many cases the awards are voted on by members of the media . In others the vote is by players , coaches , or umpires . In recent years , online polls from the public decide some awards .",

Clark sought to bring tourists to a city hurt by the Great Depression , which reduced the local tourist trade , and Prohibition , which devastated the local hops industry . Clark constructed the Hall of Fame 's building , and it was dedicated on June 12 , 1939 . ( His granddaughter , Jane Forbes Clark , is the current chairman of the Board of Directors . ) The erroneous claim that Civil War hero Abner Doubleday invented baseball in Cooperstown was instrumental in the early marketing of the Hall .

  "/wiki/Shortstop": "Shortstop , abbreviated SS , is the baseball or softball fielding position between second and third base , which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions . Historically the position was assigned to defensive specialists who were typically poor at batting and were often placed at the bottom of the batting order . Today shortstops are often able to hit well and many are placed at the top of the lineup . In the numbering system used by scorers to record defensive plays , the shortstop is assigned the number 6 . More hit balls go to the shortstop than to any other position , as there are more right-handed hitters in baseball than left-handed hitters , and most hitters have a tendency to pull the ball slightly . Like a second baseman , a shortstop must be agile , for example when performing a 4-6-3 double play . Also , like a third baseman , the shortstop fields balls hit to the left side of the infield , where a strong arm is needed to throw out a batter-runner before they reach the safety of first base .",

Moving directly from high school to the professional level is more common in baseball than in football or basketball .
