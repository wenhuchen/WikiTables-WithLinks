  "/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Service": "The Public Broadcasting Service ( PBS ) is an American public broadcaster and television program distributor . It is a nonprofit organization and the most prominent provider of educational television programming to public television stations in the United States , distributing series such as American Experience , America 's Test Kitchen , Antiques Roadshow , Arthur , Barney & Friends , Clifford the Big Red Dog , Downton Abbey , Finding Your Roots , Frontline , The Magic School Bus , Masterpiece , Mister Rogers ' Neighborhood , Nature , Nova , the PBS NewsHour , Reading Rainbow , Sesame Street , Teletubbies , and This Old House . PBS is funded by a combination of member station dues , the Corporation for Public Broadcasting , National Datacast , pledge drives , and donations from both private foundations and individual citizens . All proposed funding for programming is subject to a set of standards to ensure the program is free of influence from the funding source . Since the mid-2000s , Roper Opinion Research polls commissioned by PBS have consistently placed the service as the most-trusted national institution in the United States . A 2016-2017 study by Nielsen Media Research found 80% of all US television households view the network 's programs over the course of a year . However , PBS is not responsible for all programming carried on public television stations , a large proportion of which may come from its member stations , including WGBH-TV , WETA-TV , WNET , WTTW , WHYY-TV , Twin Cities PBS , American Public Television , and independent producers . This distinction regarding the origin of different programs on the service present a frequent source of viewer confusion . PBS has more than 350 member television stations , many owned by educational institutions , nonprofit groups both independent or affiliated with one particular local public school district or collegiate educational institution , or entities owned by or related to state government .",
