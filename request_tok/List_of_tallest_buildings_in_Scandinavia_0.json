At a key strategic location at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv , where Scandinavia 's largest drainage basin enters the sea , the Port of Gothenburg is now the largest port in the Nordic countries . Gothenburg is home to many students , as the city includes the University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology . Volvo was founded in Gothenburg in 1927 . The original parent Volvo Group and the now separate Volvo Car Corporation are still headquartered on the island of Hisingen in the city . Other key companies are SKF and Astra Zeneca .

  "/wiki/Nidarosdomen": "Nidaros Cathedral ( Norwegian : Nidarosdomen / Nidaros Domkirke ) is a cathedral of the Church of Norway located in the city of Trondheim in Tr\u00f8ndelag county . It is built over the burial site of King Olav II ( c. 995-1030 , reigned 1015-1028 ) , who became the patron saint of the nation , and is the traditional location for the consecration of new kings of Norway . It was built over a 230 year period , from 1070 to 1300 when it was substantially completed . However additional work , additions and renovations have continued intermittently since then ; the most recent changes were completed in 2001 . Nidaros was designated as the cathedral for the Diocese of Nidaros in 1152 . After experiencing the turmoil and controversies of the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century , it was taken from the Catholic Church by the newly established state Church of Norway in 1537 , which adopted the teachings and reforms of Martin Luther , Phillip Melancthon and others , becoming an Evangelical Lutheran church . Nidaros is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world . The cathedral is the main church for the Nidaros og V\u00e5r Frue parish , the seat of the Nidaros domprosti ( arch-deanery ) , and the seat of the Bishop of the Diocese of Nidaros . The Preses of the Church of Norway is also based at this cathedral . The large , stone church seats about 1,850 people and it was historically used as the site of coronation of the kings of Norway .",

The settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post , and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217 . From 1152 to 1537 , the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros ; since then , it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral . It was incorporated in 1838 . The current municipality dates from 1964 , when Trondheim merged with Byneset , Leinstrand , Strinda and Tiller . The city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county , but not as the administrative centre , which is Steinkjer . This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized , as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the second largest county in Norway ."
