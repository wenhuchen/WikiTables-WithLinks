Shaw were the co-founders of what would be named the IMAX Corporation ( founded in September 1967 as Multiscreen Corporation , Limited ) , and they developed the first IMAX cinema projection standards in the late 1960s and early 1970s in Canada . Unlike conventional film projectors , the film runs horizontally so that the image width can be greater than the width of the film stock . When IMAX was introduced , it was a radical change in the movie-going experience . Viewers were treated to the scene of a gently-curved giant screen more than seven stories tall ( 75 feet ( 23 m ) , with the tallest measuring 117 feet ( 36 m ) ) and steep stadium seating that made for a visually immersive experience . This was enhanced by a sound system that was far superior to the audio at typical theaters in the years prior to the advent of THX . Some IMAX theaters have a hemispheric dome screen geometry , which can give the viewer an even more immersive feel . Over the decades since its introduction , IMAX evolved to include 3D stereoscopic films , introduced in January 1998 , and then began to proliferate with a transition away from analog film into the digital era . Beginning in May 1991 , a visceral dimension of the movie experience was added by having the audience 's seats mounted on a full-motion platform as an amusement park ride in IMAX ride film theaters . With the advent of digital projection , the IMAX brand has also been applied to lower-resolution imaging systems , causing some degree of confusion among the viewing public .",
