  "/wiki/U2": "U2 are an Irish rock band from Dublin , formed in 1976 . The group consists of Bono ( lead vocals and rhythm guitar ) , the Edge ( lead guitar , keyboards , and backing vocals ) , Adam Clayton ( bass guitar ) , and Larry Mullen Jr. ( drums and percussion ) . Initially rooted in post-punk , U2 's musical style has evolved throughout their career , yet has maintained an anthemic quality built on Bono 's expressive vocals and the Edge 's effects-based guitar textures . Their lyrics , often embellished with spiritual imagery , focus on personal and sociopolitical themes . Popular for their live performances , the group have staged several ambitious and elaborate tours over their career . The band formed as teenagers while attending Mount Temple Comprehensive School , when they had limited musical proficiency . Within four years , they signed with Island Records and released their debut album , Boy ( 1980 ) . Subsequent work such as their first UK number-one album , War ( 1983 ) , and the singles Sunday Bloody Sunday and Pride ( In the Name of Love ) helped establish U2 's reputation as a politically and socially conscious group . By the mid-1980s , they had become renowned globally for their live act , highlighted by their performance at Live Aid in 1985 . The group 's fifth album , The Joshua Tree ( 1987 ) , made them international superstars and was their greatest critical and commercial success . Topping music charts around the world , it produced their only number-one singles in the US to date : With or Without You and I Still Have n't Found What I 'm Looking For . Facing creative stagnation and a backlash following their documentary/double album , Rattle and Hum ( 1988 ) , U2 reinvented themselves in the 1990s through a new musical direction and public image .",

Staged in support of the group 's 2009 album No Line on the Horizon , the tour visited stadiums from 2009 through 2011 . The concerts featured the band playing in the round on a circular stage , allowing the audience to surround them on all sides . To accommodate the stage configuration , a large four-legged structure nicknamed The Claw was built above the stage , with the sound system and a cylindrical , expanding video screen on top of it . At 164 feet ( 50 m ) tall , it was the largest stage ever constructed . U2 claimed that the tour would be the first time a band has toured in stadiums with such a unique and original structure . In an era of declining music sales , analysts expected U2 360\u00b0 to be a major source of income for the band . Every date of the tour sold out , many within minutes of tickets going on sale . To accommodate the time required to assemble and transport The Claw between tour dates , three separate stage structures were required on tour . The 360-degree production increased the capacity of venues by up to 25% , leading to attendance records at over 60 venues . Various themes were incorporated into the shows ; portions of the concerts featured outer space themes , due to The Claw 's resemblance to a spaceship . Pre-recorded messages from the International Space Station were displayed during the shows , as were sociopolitical statements from Desmond Tutu and Aung San Suu Kyi .",
