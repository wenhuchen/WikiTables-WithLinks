  "/wiki/Apoplexy": "Apoplexy ( from Ancient Greek \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03be\u03af\u03b1 ( apoplexia ) , meaning ' a striking away ' ) is bleeding within internal organs and the accompanying symptoms . For example , ovarian apoplexy is bleeding in the ovaries . The term formerly referred to what is now called a stroke ; nowadays , health care professionals typically specify the type of apoplexy , such as cerebral , ovarian and pituitary apoplexy . Informally or metaphorically , the term apoplexy is associated with being furious , especially as apoplectic .",
  "/wiki/Stroke": "A stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to the brain results in cell death . There are two main types of stroke : ischemic , due to lack of blood flow , and hemorrhagic , due to bleeding . Both result in parts of the brain not functioning properly . Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body , problems understanding or speaking , dizziness , or loss of vision to one side . Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred . If symptoms last less than one or two hours it is known as a transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) or mini-stroke . A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache . The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent . Long-term complications may include pneumonia or loss of bladder control . The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure . Other risk factors include tobacco smoking , obesity , high blood cholesterol , diabetes mellitus , a previous TIA , and atrial fibrillation . An ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel , though there are also less common causes .",
  "/wiki/Decompression_sickness": "Decompression sickness ( DCS ; also known as divers ' disease , the bends , aerobullosis , or caisson disease ) describes a condition arising from dissolved gases coming out of solution into bubbles inside the body on depressurisation . DCS most commonly refers to problems arising from underwater diving decompression ( i.e. , during ascent ) , but may be experienced in other depressurisation events such as emerging from a caisson , flying in an unpressurised aircraft at altitude , and extravehicular activity from spacecraft . DCS and arterial gas embolism are collectively referred to as decompression illness . Since bubbles can form in or migrate to any part of the body , DCS can produce many symptoms , and its effects may vary from joint pain and rashes to paralysis and death . Individual susceptibility can vary from day to day , and different individuals under the same conditions may be affected differently or not at all . The classification of types of DCS by its symptoms has evolved since its original description over a hundred years ago . Risk of DCS caused by diving can be managed through proper decompression procedures and contracting it is now uncommon . Its potential severity has driven much research to prevent it and divers almost universally use dive tables or dive computers to limit their exposure and to control their ascent speed . If DCS is suspected , it is treated by hyperbaric oxygen therapy in a recompression chamber . If treated early , there is a significantly higher chance of successful recovery .",
  "/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system": "The human musculoskeletal system ( also known as the locomotor system , and previously the activity system ) is an organ system that gives humans the ability to move using their muscular and skeletal systems . The musculoskeletal system provides form , support , stability , and movement to the body . It is made up of the bones of the skeleton , muscles , cartilage , tendons , ligaments , joints , and other connective tissue that supports and binds tissues and organs together . The musculoskeletal system 's primary functions include supporting the body , allowing motion , and protecting vital organs . The skeletal portion of the system serves as the main storage system for calcium and phosphorus and contains critical components of the hematopoietic system . This system describes how bones are connected to other bones and muscle fibers via connective tissue such as tendons and ligaments . The bones provide stability to the body . Muscles keep bones in place and also play a role in the movement of bones . To allow motion , different bones are connected by joints . Cartilage prevents the bone ends from rubbing directly onto each other . Muscles contract to move the bone attached at the joint . There are , however , diseases and disorders that may adversely affect the function and overall effectiveness of the system .",
  "/wiki/Dengue_fever": "Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus . Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection . These may include a high fever , headache , vomiting , muscle and joint pains , and a characteristic skin rash . Recovery generally takes two to seven days . In a small proportion of cases , the disease develops into severe dengue , also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever , resulting in bleeding , low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage , or into dengue shock syndrome , where dangerously low blood pressure occurs . Dengue is spread by several species of female mosquitoes of the Aedes type , principally A. aegypti . The virus has five types ; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type , but only short-term immunity to the others . Subsequent infection with a different type increases the risk of severe complications . A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA . A vaccine for dengue fever has been approved and is commercially available in a number of countries . The vaccine , however , is only recommended in those who have been previously infected . [ needs update ] Other methods of prevention include reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites .",
  "/wiki/Philadelphia": "Philadelphia , known colloquially as Philly , is the largest city in the U.S. state and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania , and the sixth-most populous U.S. city with a 2018 census-estimated population of 1,584,138 . Since 1854 , the city has had the same geographic boundaries as Philadelphia County , the most populous county in Pennsylvania and the urban core of the eighth-largest U.S. metropolitan statistical area , with over 6 million residents as of 2017 [ update ] . Philadelphia is also the economic and cultural anchor of the greater Delaware Valley , located along the lower Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers , within the Northeast megalopolis . The Delaware Valley 's population of 7.2 million ranks it as the eighth-largest combined statistical area in the United States . Philadelphia is one of the oldest municipalities in the United States . William Penn , an English Quaker , founded the city in 1682 to serve as capital of the Pennsylvania Colony . Philadelphia played an instrumental role in the American Revolution as a meeting place for the Founding Fathers of the United States , who signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776 at the Second Continental Congress , and the Constitution at the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 . Several other key events occurred in Philadelphia during the Revolutionary War including the First Continental Congress , the preservation of the Liberty Bell , the Battle of Germantown , and the Siege of Fort Mifflin . Philadelphia remained the nation 's largest city until being overtaken by New York City in 1790 ; the city was also one of the nation 's capitals during the revolution , serving as temporary U.S. capital while Washington , D.C. was under construction . In the 19th century , Philadelphia became a major industrial center and a railroad hub . The city grew from an influx of European immigrants , most of whom came from Ireland , Italy and Germany - the three largest reported ancestry groups in the city as of 2015 [ update ] . In the early 20th century , Philadelphia became a prime destination for African Americans during the Great Migration after the Civil War , as well as Puerto Ricans .",
  "/wiki/Tuberculosis": "Tuberculosis ( TB ) is an infectious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( MTB ) bacteria . Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs , but can also affect other parts of the body . Most infections do not have symptoms , in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis . About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which , if left untreated , kills about half of those affected . The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing mucus , fever , night sweats , and weight loss . It was historically called consumption due to the weight loss . Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms . Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough , spit , speak , or sneeze . People with latent TB do not spread the disease . Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke . Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays , as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids . Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test ( TST ) or blood tests .",
  "/wiki/Wasting": "In medicine , wasting , also known as wasting syndrome , refers to the process by which a debilitating disease causes muscle and fat tissue to waste away . Wasting is sometimes referred to as acute malnutrition because it is believed that episodes of wasting have a short duration , in contrast to stunting , which is regarded as chronic malnutrition . According to the latest UN estimates , an estimated 52 million children under 5 years of age , or 8% , were wasted in 2011 . The vast majority , about 70% , of the world 's wasted children live in Asia , most in South-Central Asia .",
  "/wiki/Edema": "Edema , also known as fluid retention or swelling , is the build up of fluid in the body 's tissue . Most commonly the legs or arms are affected . Symptoms may include skin which feels tight , the area may feel heavy , and affected joints may be hard to move . Other symptoms depend on the underlying cause . Causes may include venous insufficiency , heart failure , kidney problems , low protein levels , liver problems , deep vein thrombosis , infections , angioedema , certain medications , and lymphedema . It may also occur due to prolonged sitting or standing and during menstruation or pregnancy . The condition is more concerning if it starts suddenly , or pain or shortness of breath is present . Treatment depends on the underlying cause . If the underlying mechanism involves sodium retention , decreased salt intake and a diuretic may be used . Elevating the legs and support stockings may be useful for edema of the legs . Older people are more commonly affected . The word is from the Greek \u03bf\u1f34\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 o\u00edd\u0113ma meaning swelling .",
  "/wiki/Leishmaniasis": "Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by parasites of the Leishmania type . It is spread by the bite of certain types of sandflies . The disease can present in three main ways : cutaneous , mucocutaneous , or visceral . The cutaneous form presents with skin ulcers , while the mucocutaneous form presents with ulcers of the skin , mouth , and nose , and the visceral form starts with skin ulcers and then later presents with fever , low red blood cells , and enlarged spleen and liver . Infections in humans are caused by more than 20 species of Leishmania . Risk factors include poverty , malnutrition , deforestation , and urbanization . All three types can be diagnosed by seeing the parasites under the microscope . Additionally , visceral disease can be diagnosed by blood tests . Leishmaniasis can be partly prevented by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide . Other measures include spraying insecticides to kill sandflies and treating people with the disease early to prevent further spread . The treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired , the species of Leishmania , and the type of infection . Some possible medications used for visceral disease include liposomal amphotericin B , a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin , and miltefosine .",

  "/wiki/Rickets": "Rickets is a condition that results in weak or soft bones in children . Symptoms include bowed legs , stunted growth , bone pain , large forehead , and trouble sleeping . Complications may include bone fractures , muscle spasms , an abnormally curved spine , or intellectual disability . The most common cause of rickets is a vitamin D deficiency . This can result from eating a diet without enough vitamin D , dark skin , too little sun exposure , exclusive breastfeeding without vitamin D supplementation , celiac disease , and certain genetic conditions . Other factors may include not enough calcium or phosphorus . The underlying mechanism involves insufficient calcification of the growth plate . Diagnosis is generally based on blood tests finding a low calcium , low phosphorus , and a high alkaline phosphatase together with X-rays . Prevention for exclusively breastfed babies is vitamin D supplements . Otherwise , treatment depends on the underlying cause . If due to a lack of vitamin D , treatment is usually with vitamin D and calcium . This generally results in improvements within a few weeks .",
  "/wiki/Syphilis": "Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . The signs and symptoms of syphilis vary depending in which of the four stages it presents ( primary , secondary , latent , and tertiary ) . The primary stage classically presents with a single chancre ( a firm , painless , non-itchy skin ulceration usually between 1 cm and 2 cm in diameter ) though there may be multiple sores . In secondary syphilis , a diffuse rash occurs , which frequently involves the palms of the hands and soles of the feet . There may also be sores in the mouth or vagina . In latent syphilis , which can last for years , there are few or no symptoms . In tertiary syphilis , there are gummas ( soft , non-cancerous growths ) , neurological problems , or heart symptoms . Syphilis has been known as the great imitator as it may cause symptoms similar to many other diseases . Syphilis is most commonly spread through sexual activity . It may also be transmitted from mother to baby during pregnancy or at birth , resulting in congenital syphilis . Other diseases caused by the Treponema bacteria include yaws ( subspecies pertenue ) , pinta ( subspecies carateum ) , and nonvenereal endemic syphilis ( subspecies endemicum ) . These three diseases are not typically sexually transmitted .",
  "/wiki/Gonorrhea": "Gonorrhea , colloquially known as the clap , is a sexually transmitted infection ( STI ) caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Infection may involve the genitals , mouth , and/or rectum . Infected men may experience pain or burning with urination , discharge from the penis , or testicular pain . Infected women may experience burning with urination , vaginal discharge , vaginal bleeding between periods , or pelvic pain . Complications in women include pelvic inflammatory disease and in men include inflammation of the epididymis . Many of those infected , however , have no symptoms . If untreated , gonorrhea can spread to joints or heart valves . Gonorrhea is spread through sexual contact with an infected person . This includes oral , anal , and vaginal sex . It can also spread from a mother to a child during birth . Diagnosis is by testing the urine , urethra in males , or cervix in females . Testing all women who are sexually active and less than 25 years of age each year as well as those with new sexual partners is recommended ; the same recommendation applies in men who have sex with men ( MSM ) .",
  "/wiki/Smallpox": "Smallpox was an infectious disease caused by one of two virus variants , Variola major and Variola minor . The last naturally occurring case was diagnosed in October 1977 , and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) certified the global eradication of the disease in 1980 . The risk of death following contracting the disease was about 30% , with higher rates among babies . Often those who survived had extensive scarring of their skin , and some were left blind . The initial symptoms of the disease included fever and vomiting . This was followed by formation of sores in the mouth and a skin rash . Over a number of days the skin rash turned into characteristic fluid-filled bumps with a dent in the center . The bumps then scabbed over and fell off , leaving scars . The disease was spread between people or via contaminated objects . Prevention was by the smallpox vaccine . Once the disease had developed , certain antiviral medication may have helped . The origin of smallpox is unknown .",
  "/wiki/Influenza": "Influenza , commonly known as the flu , is an infectious disease caused by an influenza virus . Symptoms can be mild to severe . The most common symptoms include : high fever , runny nose , sore throat , muscle and joint pain , headache , coughing , and feeling tired . These symptoms typically begin two days after exposure to the virus and most last less than a week . The cough , however , may last for more than two weeks . In children , there may be diarrhea and vomiting , but these are not common in adults . Diarrhea and vomiting occur more commonly in gastroenteritis , which is an unrelated disease and sometimes inaccurately referred to as stomach flu or the 24-hour flu . Complications of influenza may include viral pneumonia , secondary bacterial pneumonia , sinus infections , and worsening of previous health problems such as asthma or heart failure . Three of the four types of influenza viruses affect humans : Type A , Type B , and Type C. Type D has not been known to infect humans , but is believed to have the potential to do so . Usually , the virus is spread through the air from coughs or sneezes . This is believed to occur mostly over relatively short distances . It can also be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by the virus and then touching the eyes , nose , or mouth .",

  "/wiki/Trismus": "Trismus , also called lockjaw , is reduced opening of the jaws ( limited jaw range of motion ) . It may be caused by spasm of the muscles of mastication or a variety of other causes . Temporary trismus occurs much more frequently than permanent trismus . It is known to interfere with eating , speaking , and maintaining proper oral hygiene . This interference , specifically with the patient 's ability to swallow properly , results in an increased risk of aspiration . In some instances , trismus presents with altered facial appearance . The condition may be distressing and painful for the patient . Examination and treatments requiring access to the oral cavity can be limited , or in some cases impossible , due to the nature of the condition itself .",
  "/wiki/Tetanus": "Tetanus , also known as lockjaw , is a bacterial infection characterized by muscle spasms . In the most common type , the spasms begin in the jaw and then progress to the rest of the body . Each spasm usually lasts a few minutes and spasms occur frequently for three to four weeks . Spasms may be severe enough to cause bone fractures . Other symptoms of tetanus may include fever , sweating , headache , trouble swallowing , high blood pressure , and a fast heart rate . Onset of symptoms is typically three to twenty-one days following infection . Recovery may take months . About ten percent of cases prove fatal . Tetanus is caused by an infection with the bacterium Clostridium tetani , which is commonly found in soil , saliva , dust , and manure . The bacteria generally enter through a break in the skin such as a cut or puncture wound by a contaminated object . They produce toxins that interfere with normal muscle contractions . Diagnosis is based on the presenting signs and symptoms .",
