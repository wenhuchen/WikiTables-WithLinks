He is generally accepted as having commissioned the Great Pyramid of Giza , one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World , but many other aspects of his reign are poorly documented .

For example , Khufu is the main character noted in the Westcar Papyrus from the 13th dynasty . Most documents that mention king Khufu were written by ancient Egyptian and Greek historians around 300 BC . Khufu 's obituary is presented there in a conflicting way : while the king enjoyed a long-lasting cultural heritage preservation during the period of the Old Kingdom and the New Kingdom , the ancient historians Manetho , Diodorus and Herodotus hand down a very negative depiction of Khufu 's character .

Djedkare succeeded Menkauhor Kaiu and was in turn succeeded by Unas . His relations to both of these pharaohs remain uncertain , although it is often conjectured that Unas was Djedkare 's son , owing to the smooth transition between the two . Djedkare likely enjoyed a reign of more than 40 years , which heralded a new period in the history of the Old Kingdom . Breaking with a tradition followed by his predecessors since the time of Userkaf , Djedkare did not build a temple to the sun god Ra , possibly reflecting the rise of Osiris in the Egyptian pantheon . More significantly , Djedkare effected comprehensive reforms of the Egyptian state administration , the first undertaken since the inception of the system of ranking titles . He also reorganised the funerary cults of his forebears buried in the necropolis of Abusir and reformed the corresponding priesthood . Djedkare commissioned expeditions to Sinai to procure copper and turquoise , to Nubia for its gold and diorite and to the fabled Land of Punt for its incense . One such expedition had what could be the earliest recorded instance of oracular divination undertaken to ensure an expedition 's success . The word Nub , meaning gold , to designate Nubia is first recorded during Djedkare 's reign .

No artefacts were found over the course of the excavations , and no trace of a burial could be found .
