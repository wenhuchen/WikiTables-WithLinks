The area emerged from the hamlet which developed around the Green , much of which survives today as Bethnal Green Gardens , located on Canbridge Heath Road . The hamlet was part of the ancient parish of Stepney , but adopted its definition as a wider district when , following population increases caused by the expansion of London in the 18th century , it was split off from Stepney as the parish of Bethnal Green in 1743 . It became part of the metropolis in 1855 and the County of London in 1889 . The parish became the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green in 1900 . In 1965 it was abolished and became a district in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets . The economic history of Bethnal Green is characterised by a shift away from agricultural provision for the City of London to market gardening , weaving and light industry , which has now all but disappeared . The quality of the built environment had deteriorated by the turn of the 20th century and was radically altered by aerial bombardment in the Second World War and the subsequent social housing developments .

On Commercial Street in the East End and in today 's Central London it is in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets , on its western border facing the City of London , it was one of the first ( and arguably one of the finest ) of the so-called Commissioners ' Churches built for the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches , which had been established by an Act of Parliament in 1711 . The purpose of the Commission was to acquire sites and build fifty new churches to serve London 's new settlements . This parish was carved out of the circa 1 square mile ( 2.6 km2 ) medieval Stepney parish for an area then dominated by Huguenots ( French Protestants and other 'dissenters ' who owed no allegiance to the Church of England and thus to the King ) as a show of Anglican authority . Some Huguenots used it for baptisms , marriages and burials but not for everyday worship , preferring their own chapels ( their chapels were severely plain compared with the bombastic English Baroque style of Christ Church ) though increasingly they assimilated into English life and Anglican worship - which was in the eighteenth century relatively plain . The Commissioners for the new churches including Christopher Wren , Thomas Archer and John Vanbrugh appointed two surveyors , one of whom was Nicholas Hawksmoor . Only twelve of the planned fifty churches were built , of which six were designed by Hawksmoor .",
