  "/wiki/Tudor_revival": "Tudor Revival architecture ( also known as mock Tudor in the UK ) first manifested itself in domestic architecture in the United Kingdom in the latter half of the 19th century . Based on revival of aspects that were perceived as Tudor architecture , in reality it usually took the style of English vernacular architecture of the Middle Ages that had survived into the Tudor period . The style later became an influence elsewhere , especially the British colonies . For example , in New Zealand , the architect Francis Petre adapted the style for the local climate . In Singapore , then a British colony , architects such as R. A. J. Bidwell pioneered what became known as the Black and White House . The earliest examples of the style originate with the works of such eminent architects as Norman Shaw and George Devey , in what at the time was thought Neo-Tudor design . Tudorbethan is a subset of Tudor Revival architecture that eliminated some of the more complex aspects of Jacobethan in favor of more domestic styles of Merrie England , which were cosier and quaint . It was associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement .",
  "/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places": "The National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) is the United States federal government 's official list of districts , sites , buildings , structures and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their historical significance . A property listed in the National Register , or located within a National Register Historic District , may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred in preserving the property . The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act ( NHPA ) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it . Of the more than one million properties on the National Register , 80,000 are listed individually . The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts . For most of its history , the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service ( NPS ) , an agency within the United States Department of the Interior . Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups , such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation , as well as coordinate , identify and protect historic sites in the United States . While National Register listings are mostly symbolic , their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties . Protection of the property is not guaranteed . During the nomination process , the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places . The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation , as well as the public and politicians . Occasionally , historic sites outside the country proper , but associated with the United States ( such as the American Embassy in Tangiers ) are also listed .",

  "/wiki/Italian_Renaissance": "The Italian Renaissance ( Italian : Rinascimento [ rina\u0283\u0283i\u02c8mento ] ) was a period in Italian history that covered the 15th ( Quattrocento ) and 16th ( Cinquecento ) centuries , spreading across Europe and marking the transition from the Middle Ages to Modernity . Proponents of a long Renaissance argue that it began in the 14th century ( Trecento ) and lasted until the 17th century ( Seicento ) . The French word renaissance ( rinascimento in Italian ) means rebirth and defines the period as one of cultural revival and renewed interest in classical antiquity after the centuries labeled the Dark Ages by Renaissance humanists . The Renaissance author Giorgio Vasari used the term Rebirth in his Lives of the Most Excellent Painters , Sculptors , and Architects in 1550 but the concept became widespread only in the 19th century , after the works of scholars such as Jules Michelet and Jacob Burckhardt . The Renaissance began in Tuscany ( Central Italy ) , and was centred in the city of Florence . Florence , one of the several city-states of the peninsula , rose to economic prominence by providing credit for European monarchs and laying down the groundwork for capitalism and banking . The Renaissance later spread to Venice , heart of a mediterranean empire and in control of the trade routes with the east since the participation in the crusades and the voyages of Marco Polo , where the remains of ancient Greek culture were brought together and provided humanist scholars with new texts . Finally the Renaissance had a significant effect on the Papal States and Rome , largely rebuilt by Humanist and Renaissance popes ( such as Alexander VI and Julius II ) , who were frequently involved in Italian politics , in arbitrating disputes between competing colonial powers and in opposing the Reformation . The Italian Renaissance is best known for its achievements in painting , architecture , sculpture , literature , music , philosophy , science and technology , and exploration . Italy became the recognized European leader in all these areas by the late 15th century , during the Peace of Lodi ( 1454-1494 ) agreed between Italian states . The Italian Renaissance peaked in the mid-16th century as domestic disputes and foreign invasions plunged the region into the turmoil of the Italian Wars ( 1494-1559 ) . However , the ideas and ideals of the Italian Renaissance spread into the rest of Europe , setting off the Northern Renaissance .",

  "/wiki/Colonial_Revival_architecture": "The Colonial Revival architectural style seeks to revive elements of American colonial architecture . The beginnings of the Colonial Revival style are often attributed to the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 , which reawakened Americans to the architectural traditions of their colonial past . Fairly small numbers of Colonial Revival homes were built c. 1880-1910 , a period when Queen Anne-style architecture was dominant in the United States . From 1910-1930 , the Colonial Revival movement was ascendant , with about 40% of U.S. homes built during this period in the Colonial Revival style . In the immediate post-war period ( c. 1950s-early 1960s ) , Colonial Revival homes continued to be constructed , but in simplified form . In the present-day , many New Traditional homes draw from Colonial Revival styles . While the dominant influences in Colonial Revival style are Georgian and Federal architecture , Colonial Revival homes also draw , to a lesser extent , from the Dutch Colonial style and post-medieval English styles . Colonial Revival homes are often eclectic in style , freely combining aspects from several of these prototypes . Although associated with the architectural movement , Colonial Revival also refers to historic preservation , landscape architecture and garden design , and decorative arts movements that emulate or draw inspiration from colonial forms . Cyril M. Harris 's American Architecture : An Illustrated Encyclopedia noted that Colonial Revival houses are usually the result of a rather free interpretation of their prototypes ; they tend to be larger , may differ significantly from the houses they seek to emulate , and often exaggerate architectural details .",
  "/wiki/Neo-Renaissance": "Renaissance Revival architecture ( sometimes referred to as Neo-Renaissance ) is a group of 19th century architectural revival styles which were neither Greek Revival nor Gothic Revival but which instead drew inspiration from a wide range of classicizing Italian modes . Under the broad designation Renaissance architecture nineteenth-century architects and critics went beyond the architectural style which began in Florence and central Italy in the early 15th century as an expression of Renaissance humanism ; they also included styles we would identify as Mannerist or Baroque . Self-applied style designations were rife in the mid- and later nineteenth century : Neo-Renaissance might be applied by contemporaries to structures that others called Italianate , or when many French Baroque features are present ( Second Empire ) . The divergent forms of Renaissance architecture in different parts of Europe , particularly in France and Italy , has added to the difficulty of defining and recognizing Neo-Renaissance architecture . A comparison between the breadth of its source material , such as the English Wollaton Hall , Italian Palazzo Pitti , the French Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord , and the Russian Palace of Facets - all deemed Renaissance - illustrates the variety of appearances the same architectural label can take .",
  "/wiki/Tudor_style_architecture": "The Tudor architectural style is the final development of Medieval architecture in England , during the Tudor period ( 1485-1603 ) and even beyond , and also the tentative introduction of Renaissance architecture to England . It is generally not used to refer to the whole period of the Tudor dynasty ( 1485-1603 ) , but to the style used in buildings of some prestige in the period roughly between 1500 and 1560 . It followed the Late Gothic Perpendicular style and was superseded by Elizabethan architecture from about 1560 in domestic building of any pretensions to fashion . In the much more slow-moving styles of vernacular architecture Tudor has become a designation for styles like half-timbering that characterize the few buildings surviving from before 1485 and others from the Stuart period . In this form the Tudor style long retained its hold on English taste . Nevertheless , 'Tudor style ' is an awkward style-designation , with its implied suggestions of continuity through the period of the Tudor dynasty and the misleading impression that there was a style break at the accession of James I in 1603 , first of the House of Stuart . The low Tudor arch was a defining feature . Some of the most remarkable oriel windows belong to this period . Mouldings are more spread out and the foliage becomes more naturalistic . During the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI , many Italian artists arrived in England ; their decorative features can be seen at Hampton Court Palace , Layer Marney Tower , Sutton Place , and elsewhere . However , in the following reign of Elizabeth I , the influence of Northern Mannerism , mainly derived from books , was greater . Courtiers and other wealthy Elizabethans competed to build prodigy houses that proclaimed their status .",

At the start of James ' reign there was little stylistic break in architecture , as Elizabethan trends continued their development . However his death in 1625 came as a decisive change towards more classical architecture , with Italian influence , was in progress , led by Inigo Jones ; the style this began is sometimes called Stuart architecture , or English Baroque ( though the latter term may be regarded as starting later ) . Courtiers continued to build large prodigy houses , even though James spent less time on summer progresses round his realm than Elizabeth had . The influence of Flemish and German Northern Mannerism increased , now often executed by immigrant craftsmen and artists , rather than obtained from books as in the previous reign .

  "/wiki/American_colonial_architecture": "American colonial architecture includes several building design styles associated with the colonial period of the United States , including First Period English ( late-medieval ) , French Colonial , Spanish Colonial , Dutch Colonial , and Georgian . These styles are associated with the houses , churches and government buildings of the period from about 1600 through the 19th century . Several relatively distinct regional styles of colonial architecture are recognized in the United States . Building styles in the 13 colonies were influenced by techniques and styles from England , as well as traditions brought by settlers from other parts of Europe . In New England , 17th-century colonial houses were built primarily from wood , following styles found in the southeastern counties of England . Saltbox style homes and Cape Cod style homes were some of the simplest of homes constructed in the New England colonies . The Saltbox homes known for their steep roof among the back the house made for easy construction among colonists . The Cape Cod style homes were a common home in the early 17th of New England colonists , these homes featured a simple , rectangular shape commonly used by colonists . Dutch Colonial structures , built primarily in the Hudson River Valley , Long Island , and northern New Jersey , reflected construction styles from Holland and Flanders and used stone and brick more extensively than buildings in New England . In Maryland , Virginia , and the Carolinas , a style called Southern Colonial is recognized , characterized by the hall and parlor and central-passage house types , which often had large chimneys projecting from the gable-ends of the house . In the Delaware Valley , Swedish colonial settlers introduced the log cabin to America .

  "/wiki/Neo-Gothic_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

  "/wiki/Mediterranean": "The Mediterranean Sea is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean , surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land : on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia , on the south by North Africa and on the east by the Levant . Although the sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean , it is usually referred to as a separate body of water . Geological evidence indicates that around 5.9 million years ago , the Mediterranean was cut off from the Atlantic and was partly or completely desiccated over a period of some 600,000 years ( the Messinian salinity crisis ) before being refilled by the Zanclean flood about 5.3 million years ago . It covers an area of about 2,500,000 km2 ( 970,000 sq mi ) , representing 0.7% of the global ocean surface , but its connection to the Atlantic via the Strait of Gibraltar - the narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates Spain in Europe from Morocco in Africa - is only 14 km ( 9 mi ) wide . In oceanography , it is sometimes called the Eurafrican Mediterranean Sea or the European Mediterranean Sea to distinguish it from mediterranean seas elsewhere . The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500 m ( 4,900 ft ) and the deepest recorded point is 5,267 m ( 17,280 ft ) in the Calypso Deep in the Ionian Sea . It lies between latitudes 30\u00b0 and 46\u00b0 N and longitudes 6\u00b0 W and 36\u00b0 E. Its west-east length , from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Gulf of Iskenderun , on the southeastern coast of Turkey , is about 4,000 kilometres ( 2,500 mi ) . The sea was an important route for merchants and travellers of ancient times , facilitating trade and cultural exchange between peoples of the region . The history of the Mediterranean region is crucial to understanding the origins and development of many modern societies . The countries surrounding the Mediterranean in clockwise order are Spain , France , Monaco , Italy , Slovenia , Croatia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Montenegro , Albania , Greece , Turkey , Syria , Lebanon , Israel , Egypt , Libya , Tunisia , Algeria , and Morocco ; Malta and Cyprus are island countries in the sea . In addition , the Gaza Strip and the British Overseas Territories of Gibraltar and Akrotiri and Dhekelia have coastlines on the sea .",
  "/wiki/Tuscan_order": "The Tuscan order ( Latin Ordo Tuscanicus or Ordo Tuscanus , with the meaning of Etruscan order ) is one of the two classical orders developed by the Romans , the other being the composite order . It is influenced by the Doric order , but with un-fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae . While relatively simple columns with round capitals had been part of the vernacular architecture of Italy and much of Europe since at least Etruscan architecture , the Romans did not consider this style to be a distinct architectural order ( for example , the Roman architect Vitruvius did not include it alongside his descriptions of the Greek Doric , Ionic , and Corinthian orders ) . Its classification as a separate formal order was made during the Italian Renaissance . Sebastiano Serlio described five orders including a Tuscan order , the solidest and least ornate , in his fourth book of Regole generali di architettura sopra le cinque maniere de gli edifici ( 1537 ) . Though Fra Giocondo had attempted a first illustration of a Tuscan capital in his printed edition of Vitruvius ( 1511 ) , he showed the capital with an egg and dart enrichment that belonged to the Ionic . The most rustic Tuscan order of Serlio was later carefully delineated by Andrea Palladio . In its simplicity , the Tuscan order is seen as similar to the Doric order , and yet in its overall proportions , intercolumniation and simpler entablature , it follows the ratios of the Ionic . This strong order was considered most appropriate in military architecture and in docks and warehouses when they were dignified by architectural treatment . Serlio found it suitable to fortified places , such as city gates , fortresses , castles , treasuries , or where artillery and ammunition are kept , prisons , seaports and other similar structures used in war .",

  "/wiki/Georgian_architecture": "Georgian architecture is the name given in most English-speaking countries to the set of architectural styles current between 1714 and 1830 . It is eponymous for the first four British monarchs of the House of Hanover - George I , George II , George III , and George IV - who reigned in continuous succession from August 1714 to June 1830 . The style was revived in the late 19th century in the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture ; in both it is also called Georgian Revival architecture . In the United States the term Georgian is generally used to describe all buildings from the period , regardless of style ; in Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are architectural in intention , and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period , though that covers a wide range . The Georgian style is highly variable , but marked by symmetry and proportion based on the classical architecture of Greece and Rome , as revived in Renaissance architecture . Ornament is also normally in the classical tradition , but typically restrained , and sometimes almost completely absent on the exterior . The period brought the vocabulary of classical architecture to smaller and more modest buildings than had been the case before , replacing English vernacular architecture ( or becoming the new vernacular style ) for almost all new middle-class homes and public buildings by the end of the period . Georgian architecture is characterized by its proportion and balance ; simple mathematical ratios were used to determine the height of a window in relation to its width or the shape of a room as a double cube . Regularity , as with ashlar ( uniformly cut ) stonework , was strongly approved , imbuing symmetry and adherence to classical rules : the lack of symmetry , where Georgian additions were added to earlier structures remaining visible , was deeply felt as a flaw , at least before John Nash began to introduce it in a variety of styles . Regularity of housefronts along a street was a desirable feature of Georgian town planning . Until the start of the Gothic Revival in the early 19th century , Georgian designs usually lay within the Classical orders of architecture and employed a decorative vocabulary derived from ancient Rome or Greece .",

  "/wiki/Venetian_Gothic_architecture": "Venetian Gothic is the local variant architectural style for Venice of Italian Gothic architecture , with a confluence of influences from local building requirements , some influence from Byzantine architecture , and some from Islamic architecture , reflecting Venice 's trading network . Very unusually for medieval architecture , the style is both at its most characteristic in secular buildings , and the great majority of survivals are secular . The best-known examples are the Doge 's Palace and the Ca ' d'Oro . Both feature loggias of closely spaced small columns , with heavy tracery with quatrefoil openings above , decoration along the roofline , and some coloured patterning to plain wall surfaces . Together with the ogee arch , capped with a relief ornament , and ropework reliefs , these are the most iconic characteristics of the style . Ecclesiastical Gothic architecture tended to be less distinctively Venetian , and closer to that in the rest of Italy . The beginning of the style probably goes back no further than the 13th century , although the dates of early Gothic palaces , and especially features such as windows in them , are largely uncertain . It dominated the 14th century and because of the city 's conservatism Venetian Gothic buildings , especially smaller palaces , continued to be built well into the second half of the 15th century , and Venetian Renaissance architecture very often retained reminiscences of its Gothic predecessor .",

  "/wiki/Tudor_Revival_architecture": "Tudor Revival architecture ( also known as mock Tudor in the UK ) first manifested itself in domestic architecture in the United Kingdom in the latter half of the 19th century . Based on revival of aspects that were perceived as Tudor architecture , in reality it usually took the style of English vernacular architecture of the Middle Ages that had survived into the Tudor period . The style later became an influence elsewhere , especially the British colonies . For example , in New Zealand , the architect Francis Petre adapted the style for the local climate . In Singapore , then a British colony , architects such as R. A. J. Bidwell pioneered what became known as the Black and White House . The earliest examples of the style originate with the works of such eminent architects as Norman Shaw and George Devey , in what at the time was thought Neo-Tudor design . Tudorbethan is a subset of Tudor Revival architecture that eliminated some of the more complex aspects of Jacobethan in favor of more domestic styles of Merrie England , which were cosier and quaint . It was associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement ."
