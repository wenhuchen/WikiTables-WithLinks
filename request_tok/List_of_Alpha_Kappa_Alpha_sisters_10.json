  "/wiki/Physician": "A physician ( American English ) , medical practitioner ( Commonwealth English ) , medical doctor , or simply doctor , is a professional who practises medicine , which is concerned with promoting , maintaining , or restoring health through the study , diagnosis , prognosis and treatment of disease , injury , and other physical and mental impairments . Physicians may focus their practice on certain disease categories , types of patients , and methods of treatment - known as specialities - or they may assume responsibility for the provision of continuing and comprehensive medical care to individuals , families , and communities - known as general practice . Medical practice properly requires both a detailed knowledge of the academic disciplines , such as anatomy and physiology , underlying diseases and their treatment - the science of medicine - and also a decent competence in its applied practice - the art or craft of medicine . Both the role of the physician and the meaning of the word itself vary around the world . Degrees and other qualifications vary widely , but there are some common elements , such as medical ethics requiring that physicians show consideration , compassion , and benevolence for their patients .",

  "/wiki/Nurse": "Nursing is a profession within the health care sector focused on the care of individuals , families , and communities so they may attain , maintain , or recover optimal health and quality of life . Nurses may be differentiated from other health care providers by their approach to patient care , training , and scope of practice . Nurses practice in many specialties with differing levels of prescription authority . Many nurses provide care within the ordering scope of physicians , and this traditional role has shaped the public image of nurses as care providers . However , nurse practitioners are permitted by most jurisdictions to practice independently in a variety of settings . Since the postwar period , nurse education has undergone a process of diversification towards advanced and specialized credentials , and many of the traditional regulations and provider roles are changing . Nurses develop a plan of care , working collaboratively with physicians , therapists , the patient , the patient 's family , and other team members that focuses on treating illness to improve quality of life . In the United States and the United Kingdom , advanced practice nurses , such as clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners , diagnose health problems and prescribe medications and other therapies , depending on individual state regulations . Nurses may help coordinate the patient care performed by other members of a multidisciplinary health care team such as therapists , medical practitioners , and dietitians .

  "/wiki/Outer_space": "Outer space , or simply space , is the expanse that exists beyond the Earth and between celestial bodies . Outer space is not completely empty - it is a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles , predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium , as well as electromagnetic radiation , magnetic fields , neutrinos , dust , and cosmic rays . The baseline temperature of outer space , as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang , is 2.7 kelvins ( \u2212270.45 \u00b0C ; \u2212454.81 \u00b0F ) . The plasma between galaxies accounts for about half of the baryonic ( ordinary ) matter in the universe ; it has a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions of kelvins . Local concentrations of matter have condensed into stars and galaxies . Studies indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form , called dark matter , which interacts with other matter through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces . Observations suggest that the majority of the mass-energy in the observable universe is dark energy , a type of vacuum energy that is poorly understood . Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the universe , but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space . Outer space does not begin at a definite altitude above the Earth 's surface . However , the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line , an altitude of 100 km ( 62 mi ) above sea level , is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping . The framework for international space law was established by the Outer Space Treaty , which entered into force on 10 October 1967 . This treaty precludes any claims of national sovereignty and permits all states to freely explore outer space .",

Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours and 39 minutes later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC ; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later . They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft , and they collected 47.5 pounds ( 21.5 kg ) of lunar material to bring back to Earth . Command module pilot Michael Collins flew the Command Module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon 's surface . Armstrong and Aldrin spent 21 hours , 36 minutes on the lunar surface at a site they named Tranquility Base before lifting off to rejoin Columbia in lunar orbit . Apollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island , Florida , on July 16 at 13:32 UTC , and it was the fifth crewed mission of NASA 's Apollo program . The Apollo spacecraft had three parts : a command module ( CM ) with a cabin for the three astronauts , the only part that returned to Earth ; a service module ( SM ) , which supported the command module with propulsion , electrical power , oxygen , and water ; and a lunar module ( LM ) that had two stages - a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit . After being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V 's third stage , the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit . Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility on July 20 .

  "/wiki/Moon": "The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits Earth as its only natural satellite . It is the fifth-largest satellite in the Solar System , and by far the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits ( its primary ) . The Moon is , after Jupiter 's satellite Io , the second-densest satellite in the Solar System among those whose densities are known . The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago , not long after Earth . The most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a hypothetical Mars-sized body called Theia . New research of Moon rocks , although not rejecting the Theia hypothesis , suggests that the Moon may be older than previously thought . The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth , and thus always shows the same side to Earth , the near side . Because of libration , slightly more than half ( about 59% ) of the total lunar surface can be viewed from Earth . The near side is marked by dark volcanic maria that fill the spaces between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters . After the Sun , the Moon is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth 's sky . Its surface is actually dark , although compared to the night sky it appears very bright , with a reflectance just slightly higher than that of worn asphalt . Its gravitational influence produces the ocean tides , body tides , and the slight lengthening of the day .",

Psychoanalysis was later developed in different directions , mostly by students of Freud such as Alfred Adler and his collaborator , Carl Gustav Jung , [ a ] and by neo-Freudians such as Erich Fromm , Karen Horney and Harry Stack Sullivan . Freud retained the term psychoanalysis for his own school of thought . Psychoanalysis is a controversial discipline and its validity as a science is contested . Nonetheless , it remains a strong influence within psychiatry , more so in some quarters than others . [ b ] [ c ] The proportion of practitioners of Freudian psychoanalysis has declined as evidence-based medicine has increased the use of cognitive behavioral therapy .

Obstacles such as mountains and buildings block the relatively weak GPS signals . The GPS does not require the user to transmit any data , and it operates independently of any telephonic or internet reception , though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the GPS positioning information . The GPS provides critical positioning capabilities to military , civil , and commercial users around the world . The United States government created the system , maintains it , and makes it freely accessible to anyone with a GPS receiver . The GPS project was started by the U.S. Department of Defense in 1973 , with the first prototype spacecraft launched in 1978 and the full constellation of 24 satellites operational in 1993 . Originally limited to use by the United States military , civilian use was allowed from the 1980s thanks to an executive order from President Ronald Reagan . Advances in technology and new demands on the existing system have now led to efforts to modernize the GPS and implement the next generation of GPS Block IIIA satellites and Next Generation Operational Control System ( OCX ) . Announcements from Vice President Al Gore and the White House in 1998 initiated these changes . In 2000 , the U.S. Congress authorized the modernization effort , GPS III .
