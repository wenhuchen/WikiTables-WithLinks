Decisions in leading cases in Canada have usually been made by the Supreme Court of Canada . Prior to the abolition of appeals of Supreme Court decisions in the 1940s , most landmark decisions were made by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London .",

In 1914, Canadian jurist Augustus Henry Frazer Lefroy said a 'leading case' [is] one that settles the law upon some important point. A leading decision may settle the law in more than one way.
