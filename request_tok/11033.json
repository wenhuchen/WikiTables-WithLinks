When the United Kingdom ended its protectorate over Egypt on 28 February 1922 , Egypt 's Sultan Fouad I issued a decree on 15 March 1922 whereby he adopted the title of King of Egypt . It has been reported that the title change was due not only to Egypt 's newly independent status , but also to Fouad I 's desire to be accorded the same title as the newly installed rulers of the newly created kingdoms of Hejaz , Syria and Iraq . The only other monarch to be styled King of Egypt was Fouad I 's son Farouk I , whose title was changed to King of Egypt and the Sudan in October 1951 following the Wafdist government 's unilateral abrogation of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 . The monarchy was abolished on 18 June 1953 following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 and the establishment of a republic . The then-king , the infant Fuad II of Egypt ( Farouk having abdicated following the revolution ) , went into exile in Switzerland .

In traditional Chinese political theory , the Emperor was considered the Son of Heaven and the autocrat of All under Heaven . Under the Han dynasty , Confucianism replaced Legalism as the official political theory and succession theoretically followed agnatic primogeniture . The Chinese emperors who shared the same family were classified into historical periods known as dynasties . The absolute authority of the emperor was notionally bound with various duties and obligations ; failure to uphold these was thought to remove the dynasty 's Mandate of Heaven and to justify its replacement . In practice , emperors and heirs sometimes avoided the strict rules of succession and dynasties ' ostensible failures were detailed in official histories written by their successful replacements . The power of the emperor was also often limited by the imperial bureaucracy staffed by scholar-officials and eunuchs and by filial obligations to surviving parents and to dynastic traditions , such as those detailed in the Ming dynasty 's Ancestral Instructions .",

After several delays in elections , King Gyanendra suspended the constitution and assumed direct authority in February 2005 , asserting that it would be a temporary measure to suppress the Maoist insurgency . In the face of broad opposition , he restored the previous parliament in April 2006 .

Dalai Lamas are important monks of the Gelug school , the newest school of Tibetan Buddhism , which was formally headed by the Ganden Tripas . From the time of the 5th Dalai Lama to 1959 , the central government of Tibet , the Ganden Phodrang , invested the position of Dalai Lama with temporal duties . The 14th Dalai Lama was born in Taktser , Amdo , Tibet . He was selected as the tulku of the 13th Dalai Lama in 1937 and formally recognized as the 14th Dalai Lama in a public declaration near the town of Bumchen in 1939 . On 26 January 1940 , the Regent Reting Rinpoche requested the Central Government to exempt Tenzin Gyatso from the lot-drawing process of the Golden Urn to become the 14th Dalai Lama . The request was approved by the Central Government . His enthronement ceremony as the Dalai Lama was held in Lhasa on 22 February 1940 and he eventually assumed full temporal ( political ) duties on 17 November 1950 , at the age of 15 , after the People 's Republic of China 's occupation of Tibet . The Gelug school 's government administered an area roughly corresponding to the Tibet Autonomous Region , just as the nascent PRC wished to assert control over it .

The 14th and current Dalai Lama is Tenzin Gyatso , who lives as a refugee in India . The Dalai Lama is also considered to be the successor in a line of tulkus who are believed to be incarnations of Avalokite\u015bvara , a Bodhisattva of Compassion . The name is a combination of the Mongolic word dalai meaning ocean or big ( coming from Mongolian title Dalaiyin qan or Dalaiin khan , translated as Gyatso in Tibetan ) and the Tibetan word \u0f56\u0fb3\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f0b ( bla-ma ) meaning master , guru . Since the time of the 5th Dalai Lama in the 17th century , his personage has always been a symbol of unification of the state of Tibet , where he has represented Buddhist values and traditions . The Dalai Lama was an important figure of the Geluk tradition , which was politically and numerically dominant in Central Tibet , but his religious authority went beyond sectarian boundaries . While he had no formal or institutional role in any of the religious traditions , which were headed by their own high lamas , he was a unifying symbol of the Tibetan state , representing Buddhist values and traditions above any specific school . The traditional function of the Dalai Lama as an ecumenical figure , holding together disparate religious and regional groups , has been taken up by the present fourteenth Dalai Lama . He has worked to overcome sectarian and other divisions in the exiled community and has become a symbol of Tibetan nationhood for Tibetans both in Tibet and in exile . From 1642 until 1705 and from 1750 to the 1950s , the Dalai Lamas or their regents headed the Tibetan government ( or Ganden Phodrang ) in Lhasa which governed all or most of the Tibetan Plateau with varying degrees of autonomy under the Qing Dynasty of China , in which Tibet had been under non-Tibetan suzerainty , and a period of disputed de facto independence between 1913 and 1951 . This Tibetan government also enjoyed the patronage and protection of firstly Mongol kings of the Khoshut and Dzungar Khanates ( 1642-1720 ) and then of the emperors of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty ( 1720-1912 ) . In 1913 , several Tibetan representatives including Agvan Dorzhiev signed a treaty between Tibet and Mongolia , proclaiming mutual recognition and their independence from China , however the legitimacy of the treaty and declared independence of Tibet was rejected by both the Republic of China and the current People 's Republic of China .",

The council proved to be ineffective and , in 1930 , Carol returned to Romania and replaced his son as monarch , reigning as Carol II . As a result , Michael returned to being heir apparent to the throne and was given the additional title of Grand Voievod of Alba-Iulia . Carol II was deposed in 1940 , and Michael once again became king . Under the government led by the military dictator Ion Antonescu , Romania became aligned with Nazi Germany .

  "/wiki/Tsar_of_Bulgaria": "The monarchs of Bulgaria ruled the country during three periods of its history as an independent country : from the establishment of the First Bulgarian Empire in 681 to the Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria in 1018 ; from the Uprising of Asen and Peter that established the Second Bulgarian Empire in 1185 to the annexation of the rump Bulgarian principality into the Ottoman Empire in 1396 ; and from the re-establishment of an independent Bulgaria in 1878 to the abolition of monarchy in a referendum held on 15 September 1946 . Early Bulgarian rulers possibly used the title Kanasubigi ( Khan ) , later knyaz ( prince ) for a brief period , and subsequently tsar ( emperor ) . The title tsar , the Bulgarian form of the Latin Caesar , was first adopted and used in Bulgaria by Simeon I , following a decisive victory over the Byzantine Empire in 913 . It was also used by all of Simeon I 's successors until the fall of Bulgaria under Ottoman rule in 1396 . After Bulgaria 's liberation from the Ottomans in 1878 , its first monarch Alexander I adopted the title knyaz , or prince . However , when de jure independence was proclaimed under his successor Ferdinand in 1908 , the title was elevated to the customary tsar once more . The use of tsar continued under Ferdinand and later under his heirs Boris III and Simeon II until the abolition of monarchy in 1946 . While the title tsar was translated as emperor in the First and Second Bulgarian Empires , it was translated as king in modern Bulgaria .

During Alfonso 's reign Spain experienced four major problems that contributed to the end of the liberal monarchy : the lack of real political representation of broad social groups ; the poor situation of the popular classes , especially peasants ; problems arising from the Rif War ; and Catalan nationalism . The political and social turbulence that began with the Spanish-American War prevented the turnaround parties from establishing a true liberal democracy , which led to the establishment of the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera . With the political failure of the dictatorship , Alfonso impelled a return to the democratic normality with the intention of regenerating the regime . Nevertheless , it was abandoned by all political classes , as they felt betrayed by the king 's support of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera .
