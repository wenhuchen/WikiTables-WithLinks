  "/wiki/Bronze": "Bronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper , commonly with about 12-12.5% tin and often with the addition of other metals ( such as aluminium , manganese , nickel or zinc ) and sometimes non-metals or metalloids such as arsenic , phosphorus or silicon . These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone , or have other useful properties , such as stiffness , ductility , or machinability . The archeological period in which bronze was the hardest metal in widespread use is known as the Bronze Age . The beginning of the Bronze Age in India and western Eurasia is conventionally dated to the mid-4th millennium BC , and to the early 2nd millennium BC in China ; elsewhere it gradually spread across regions . The Bronze Age was followed by the Iron Age starting from about 1300 BC and reaching most of Eurasia by about 500 BC , although bronze continued to be much more widely used than it is in modern times . Because historical pieces were often made of brasses ( copper and zinc ) and bronzes with different compositions , modern museum and scholarly descriptions of older objects increasingly use the generalized term copper alloy instead .",
  "/wiki/Granite": "Granite ( /\u02c8\u0261r\u00e6n\u026at/ ) is a common type of felsic intrusive igneous rock that is granular and phaneritic in texture . Granites can be predominantly white , pink , or gray in color , depending on their mineralogy . The word granite comes from the Latin granum , a grain , in reference to the coarse-grained structure of such a holocrystalline rock . Strictly speaking , granite is an igneous rock with between 20% and 60% quartz by volume , and at least 35% of the total feldspar consisting of alkali feldspar , although commonly the term granite is used to refer to a wider range of coarse-grained igneous rocks containing quartz and feldspar . The term granitic means granite-like and is applied to granite and a group of intrusive igneous rocks with similar textures and slight variations in composition and origin . These rocks mainly consist of feldspar , quartz , mica , and amphibole minerals , which form an interlocking , somewhat equigranular matrix of feldspar and quartz with scattered darker biotite mica and amphibole ( often hornblende ) peppering the lighter color minerals . Occasionally some individual crystals ( phenocrysts ) are larger than the groundmass , in which case the texture is known as porphyritic . A granitic rock with a porphyritic texture is known as a granite porphyry . Granitoid is a general , descriptive field term for lighter-colored , coarse-grained igneous rocks . Petrographic examination is required for identification of specific types of granitoids . The extrusive igneous rock equivalent of granite is rhyolite .",

  "/wiki/Concrete": "Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement ( cement paste ) that hardens ( cures ) over time . In the past limebased cement binders were often used , such as lime putty , but sometimes with other hydraulic cements , such as a calcium aluminate cement or with Portland cement to form Portland cement concrete ( for its visual resemblance to Portland stone ) . Many other non-cementitious types of concrete exist with different methods of binding aggregate together , including asphalt concrete with a bitumen binder , which is frequently used for road surfaces , and polymer concretes that use polymers as a binder . When aggregate is mixed with dry Portland cement and water , the mixture forms a fluid slurry that is easily poured and molded into shape . The cement reacts with the water and other ingredients to form a hard matrix that binds the materials together into a durable stone-like material that has many uses . Often , additives ( such as pozzolans or superplasticizers ) are included in the mixture to improve the physical properties of the wet mix or the finished material . Most concrete is poured with reinforcing materials ( such as rebar ) embedded to provide tensile strength , yielding reinforced concrete . Because concrete cures ( which is not the same as drying such as with paint ) how concrete is handled after it is poured is just as important as before . Concrete is one of the most frequently used building materials . Its usage worldwide , ton for ton , is twice that of steel , wood , plastics , and aluminum combined . Globally , the ready-mix concrete industry , the largest segment of the concrete market , is projected to exceed $ 600 billion in revenue by 2025 . Concrete is distinct from mortar .",

It is categorized by the minerals included , its chemical composition and the way in which it is formed . Rocks are usually grouped into three main groups : igneous rocks , metamorphic rocks and sedimentary rocks . Rocks form the Earth 's outer solid layer , the crust . Igneous rocks are formed when magma cools in the Earth 's crust , or lava cools on the ground surface or the seabed . The metamorphic rocks are formed when existing rocks are subjected to such large pressures and temperatures that they are transformed - something that occurs , for example , when continental plates collide . The sedimentary rocks are formed by diagenesis or lithification of sediments , which in turn are formed by the weathering , transport , and deposition of existing rocks . The scientific study of rocks is called petrology , which is an essential component of geology .",

  "/wiki/Steel": "Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon , and sometimes other elements . Because of its high tensile strength and low cost , it is a major component used in buildings , infrastructure , tools , ships , trains , automobiles , machines , appliances , and weapons . Iron is the base metal of steel . Iron is able to take on two crystalline forms ( allotropic forms ) , body centered cubic and face-centered cubic , depending on its temperature . In the body-centered cubic arrangement , there is an iron atom in the center and eight atoms at the vertices of each cubic unit cell ; in the face-centered cubic , there is one atom at the center of each of the six faces of the cubic unit cell and eight atoms at its vertices . It is the interaction of the allotropes of iron with the alloying elements , primarily carbon , that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties . In pure iron , the crystal structure has relatively little resistance to the iron atoms slipping past one another , and so pure iron is quite ductile , or soft and easily formed . In steel , small amounts of carbon , other elements , and inclusions within the iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations . The carbon in typical steel alloys may contribute up to 2.14% of its weight . Varying the amount of carbon and many other alloying elements , as well as controlling their chemical and physical makeup in the final steel ( either as solute elements , or as precipitated phases ) , slows the movement of those dislocations that make pure iron ductile , and thus controls and enhances its qualities . These qualities include the hardness , quenching behavior , need for annealing , tempering behavior , yield strength , and tensile strength of the resulting steel . The increase in steel 's strength compared to pure iron is possible only by reducing iron 's ductility .",

She was born and raised in Washington , D.C. to parents working in education , and was the grandchild of freed slaves . It was difficult for a black woman in this time to pursue a career as a working artist . Catlett devoted much of her career to teaching . However , a fellowship awarded to her in 1946 allowed her to travel to Mexico City , where she worked with the Taller de Gr\u00e1fica Popular for twenty years and became head of the sculpture department for the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl\u00e1sticas . In the 1950s , her main means of artistic expression shifted from print to sculpture , though she never gave up the former . Her work is a mixture of abstract and figurative in the Modernist tradition , with influence from African and Mexican art traditions . According to the artist , the main purpose of her work is to convey social messages rather than pure aesthetics . Her work is heavily studied by art students looking to depict race , gender and class issues .

Metals are typically malleable ( they can be hammered into thin sheets ) or ductile ( can be drawn into wires ) . A metal may be a chemical element such as iron ; an alloy such as stainless steel ; or a molecular compound such as polymeric sulfur nitride . In physics , a metal is generally regarded as any substance capable of conducting electricity at a temperature of absolute zero . Many elements and compounds that are not normally classified as metals become metallic under high pressures . For example , the nonmetal iodine gradually becomes a metal at a pressure of between 40 and 170 thousand times atmospheric pressure . Equally , some materials regarded as metals can become nonmetals . Sodium , for example , becomes a nonmetal at pressure of just under two million times atmospheric pressure . In chemistry , two elements that would otherwise qualify ( in physics ) as brittle metals - arsenic and antimony - are commonly instead recognised as metalloids , on account of their predominately non-metallic chemistry . Around 95 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals ( or are likely to be such ) . The number is inexact as the boundaries between metals , nonmetals , and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved . In astrophysics the term metal is cast more widely to refer to all chemical elements in a star that are heavier than the lightest two , hydrogen and helium , and not just traditional metals .",

  "/wiki/Iron": "Iron ( /\u02c8a\u026a\u0259rn/ ) is a chemical element with symbol Fe ( from Latin : ferrum ) and atomic number 26 . It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table . It is by mass the most common element on Earth , forming much of Earth 's outer and inner core . It is the fourth most common element in the Earth 's crust . In its metallic state , iron is rare in the Earth 's crust , limited to deposition by meteorites . Iron ores , by contrast , are among the most abundant in the Earth 's crust , although extracting usable metal from them requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1,500 \u00b0C ( 2,730 \u00b0F ) or higher , about 500 \u00b0C ( 900 \u00b0F ) higher than what is enough to smelt copper . Humans started to master that process in Eurasia only about 2000 BCE [ not verified in body ] , and the use of iron tools and weapons began to displace copper alloys , in some regions , only around 1200 BCE . That event is considered the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age . In the modern world , iron alloys , such as steel , inox , cast iron and special steels are by far the most common industrial metals , because of their high mechanical properties and low cost . Pristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are mirror-like silvery-gray . However , iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to give brown to black hydrated iron oxides , commonly known as rust . Unlike the oxides of some other metals , that form passivating layers , rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off , exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion .",

Founded after the American Revolution as the seat of government of the newly independent country , Washington was named after George Washington , the first president of the United States and a Founding Father . As the seat of the United States federal government and several international organizations , Washington is an important world political capital . The city , located on the Potomac River bordering Maryland and Virginia , is one of the most visited cities in the world , with more than 20 million tourists annually . The signing of the Residence Act on July 16 , 1790 , approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River on the country 's East Coast . The U.S. Constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress , and the District is therefore not a part of any U.S. state . The states of Maryland and Virginia each donated land to form the federal district , which included the pre-existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria . The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital . In 1846 , Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia , including the city of Alexandria ; in 1871 , it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District . Washington had an estimated population of 702,455 as of July 2018 [ update ] , making it the 20th most populous city in the United States .
