  "/wiki/Scuba_diving": "Scuba diving is a mode of underwater diving where the diver uses a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus ( scuba ) , which is completely independent of surface supply , to breathe underwater . Scuba divers carry their own source of breathing gas , usually compressed air , allowing them greater independence and freedom of movement than surface-supplied divers , and longer underwater endurance than breath-hold divers . Although the use of compressed air is common , a new mixture called enriched air ( Nitrox ) has been gaining popularity due to its benefit of reduced nitrogen intake during repetitive dives . Open circuit scuba systems discharge the breathing gas into the environment as it is exhaled , and consist of one or more diving cylinders containing breathing gas at high pressure which is supplied to the diver through a regulator . They may include additional cylinders for range extension , decompression gas or emergency breathing gas . Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba systems allow recycling of exhaled gases . The volume of gas used is reduced compared to that of open circuit , so a smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration . Rebreathers extend the time spent underwater compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption ; they produce fewer bubbles and less noise than open circuit scuba which makes them attractive to covert military divers to avoid detection , scientific divers to avoid disturbing marine animals , and media divers to avoid bubble interference . Scuba diving may be done recreationally or professionally in a number of applications , including scientific , military and public safety roles , but most commercial diving uses surface-supplied diving equipment when this is practicable . Scuba divers engaged in armed forces covert operations may be referred to as frogmen , combat divers or attack swimmers . A scuba diver primarily moves underwater by using fins attached to the feet , but external propulsion can be provided by a diver propulsion vehicle , or a sled pulled from the surface . Other equipment includes a mask to improve underwater vision , exposure protection , equipment to control buoyancy , and equipment related to the specific circumstances and purpose of the dive .",

  "/wiki/Grenade": "A grenade is an explosive weapon typically thrown by hand , but can also refer to projectiles shot out of grenade launchers . Generally , a grenade consists of an explosive charge , a detonating mechanism , and firing pin inside the grenade to trigger the detonating mechanism . Once the soldier throws the grenade , the safety lever releases , the striker throws the safety lever away from the grenade body as it rotates to detonate the primer . The primer explodes and ignites the fuze ( sometimes called the delay element ) . The fuze burns down to the detonator , which explodes the main charge . There are several types of grenades like the fragmentation ( frag ) , high explosive ( HE ) concussion and smoke grenades . Fragmentation grenades are probably the most common in modern armies . They are missiles designed to disperse shrapnel on detonation . The body is generally made of a hard synthetic material or steel , which will provide limited fragmentation through sharding and splintering , though in modern grenades a pre-formed fragmentation matrix inside the grenade is commonly used . The pre-formed fragmentation may be spherical , cuboid , wire or notched wire . Most anti-personnel ( AP ) grenades are designed to detonate either after a time delay or on impact .

Line 2 , the Blue Line ( formerly , the Purple Line ) , was completed in 2004 and runs east-west . The original Line 1 was built as a no-frills means of public transport and lacks some features and comforts , but the newer Line 2 has been built with additional standards and criteria in mind like barrier-free access . Line 1 serves 500,000 passengers daily while the Line 2 serves 200,000 passengers . Security guards at each station conduct inspections and provide assistance .
