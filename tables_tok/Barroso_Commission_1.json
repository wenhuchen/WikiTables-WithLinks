  "section_text": "Catherine Ashton ( left ) , High Representative and First vice-president with the US Secretary of State . The second Barroso Commission was elected by Parliament on 9 February 2010 after securing concessions from president Barroso and securing the replacement of the Bulgarian designate . They had support from all except for The Greens\u2013European Free Alliance and the European United Left\u2013Nordic Green Left and the European Conservatives and Reformists . [ 3 ] The new college included the High Representative for the first time , due to changes from the Lisbon Treaty . Therefore , the High Representative , Catherine Ashton , became ex-officio First-Vice-President . Despite requests for more women , member states nominated only nine women of the twenty-seven designates . In keeping with the balance in the Council , and Barroso 's voting base in parliament , most Commissions stem from the centre-right with 13 from the EPP , 7 from ALDE and only 7 from the centre-left PES . 13 members ( including all the vice-presidents ) are staying on from the previous Barroso Commission and Barnier served in the Prodi Commission . Below are all the Commissioners as their appointment . Some innovations include splitting the justice , freedom and security portfolio , creating the climate action portfolio and reversing the splits created in 2007 for the Bulgarian and Romanian commissioners . [ 48 ] [ 49 ] When Croatia joined the EU on July 2013 , the Health/Consumer Protection split made during Bulgaria 's accession in 2007 was replicated . Dalli was forced to resign in October 2012 due to a lobbying frame-up . His replacement is Tonio Borg . Five commissioners ( Janusz Lewandowski , Neven Mimica , Viviane Reding , Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d and Antonio Tajani ) took electoral leave from 19 April 2014 \u2013 25 May 2014 while Olli Rehn began his leave earlier from 7 April 2014 . During that time , each of their portfolios was taken over by Andris Piebalgs , L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Andor , Johannes Hahn , Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso , Michel Barnier and Siim Kallas , respectively . [ 71 ] After the elections and parliament 's promulgation on 1 July 2014 , Lewandowski , Reding , Rehn and Tajani took up their seats as MEPs and were each replaced by the same commissioners as when they were on leave ( Piebalgs , Hahn , Kallas and Barnier , respectively ) . [ 72 ] Karel De Gucht took neither electoral leave nor his eventual seat . [ 73 ]",

  "intro": "The Barroso Commission was the European Commission in office from 22 November 2004 until 31 October 2014. Its president was Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, who presided over 27 other commissioners (one from each of the states composing the European Union, aside from Portugal, which is Barroso's state). On 16 September 2009 Barroso was re-elected by the European Parliament for a further five years and his Commission was approved to take office on 9 February 2010. Barroso was at first seen as the lowest common denominator by outside commentators, but his proposed team of Commissioners earned him some respect before triggering a crisis when the European Parliament objected to some of them, forcing a reshuffle. In 2007 the Commission gained two new members when Romania and Bulgaria joined the European Union. Barroso's handling of his office was markedly more Presidential than his predecessors'. During his term the Commission passed major legislation including the REACH and 'Bolkestein' Directives. Under Barroso, the civil service in the Commission became more economically liberal."
