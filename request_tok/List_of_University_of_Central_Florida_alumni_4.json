Upon its launch in 1980 , CNN was the first television channel to provide 24-hour news coverage and was the first all-news television channel in the United States . While the news channel has numerous affiliates , CNN primarily broadcasts from 30 Hudson Yards in New York City , and studios in Washington , D.C. and Los Angeles . Its headquarters at the CNN Center in Atlanta is only used for weekend programming . CNN is sometimes referred to as CNN/U.S . ( or CNN Domestic ) to distinguish the U.S. channel from its international sister network , CNN International . The network is known for its dramatic live coverage of breaking news , some of which has drawn criticism as overly sensationalistic , and for its efforts to be nonpartisan , which have led to accusations of false balance . As of September 2018 , CNN has 90.1 million television households as subscribers ( 97.7% of households with cable ) in the United States . In 2019 , CNN ranked third in viewership among cable news networks , behind rivals Fox News and MSNBC , averaging 972,000 viewers . CNN ranks 14th among all basic cable networks .
