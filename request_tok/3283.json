  "/wiki/Buenos_Aires": "Buenos Aires ( /\u02ccbwe\u026an\u0259s \u02c8\u025b\u0259ri\u02d0z/ or /-\u02c8a\u026ar\u026as/ ; Spanish pronunciation : [ \u02c8bwenos \u02c8ai\u027ees ] ) is the capital and largest city of Argentina . The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the R\u00edo de la Plata , on the South American continent 's southeastern coast . Buenos Aires can be translated as fair winds or good airs , but the former was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century , by the use of the original name Real de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Santa Mar\u00eda del Buen Ayre , named after the Madonna of Bonaria in Sardinia . The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation , which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts , constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas , with a population of around 15.6 million . The city of Buenos Aires is neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province 's capital ; rather , it is an autonomous district . In 1880 , after decades of political infighting , Buenos Aires was federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province . The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores ; both are now neighborhoods of the city . The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy , hence its formal name of Autonomous City of Buenos Aires ( Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires ; CABA ) . Its citizens first elected a chief of government ( i.e . mayor ) in 1996 ; previously , the mayor was directly appointed by the President of the Republic . Buenos Aires ' quality of life was ranked 91st in the world in 2018 , being one of the best in Latin America . In 2012 , it was the most visited city in South America , and the second-most visited city of Latin America ( behind Mexico City ) .",

They have competed at every Rugby World Cup staged since the first tournament of 1987 , and the country are considered the strongest within the Americas , being undefeated against all but Canada , against whom they have suffered three losses . Although rugby union in Argentina is not as popular as association football , the Pumas ' impressive results since the 1999 World Cup have seen the sport 's popularity grow significantly . Argentina has achieved several upset victories , are tough contenders when playing in Buenos Aires , and are capable of regularly defeating Six Nations sides . A surprise victory over the hosts France in the first game of the 2007 World Cup took Argentina to fourth in the IRB World Rankings . The team were undefeated in their pool , and reached the semi-finals for the first time , beating Scotland 19-13 in their quarter-final . They were defeated 37-13 by eventual winners South Africa in the semi-finals , but followed this up with a second win over France to claim third place overall . By the end of the competition , the team had reached an all-time high of third in the World Rankings . After their advances in competitiveness and performance during the 2000s , coupled with their location in the Southern Hemisphere , Argentina was the only tier 1 nation that had no regular competition , and some , among them former Pumas captain Agust\u00edn Pichot , had even spoken of them joining the Six Nations .
