The trust describes itself as a charity that works to preserve and protect historic places and spaces - for ever , for everyone . The trust was founded in 1895 and given statutory powers , starting with the National Trust Act 1907 . Historically , the Trust acquired land by gift and sometimes by public subscription and appeal , but after World War II the loss of English country houses resulted in many such properties being acquired either by gift from the former owners , or through the National Land Fund , later the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the National Lottery . Country Houses and Estates still make up a significant part of its holdings , but it is also known for its protection of wild landscapes such as in the Lake District and Peak District , historic urban properties , and nature reserves such as Wicken Fen . In Scotland , there is a separate and independent National Trust for Scotland . The National Trust has a unique special power to prevent its inalienable land being sold off , although this can be over-ridden by Parliamentary procedure .

  "/wiki/Soup_kitchen": "A soup kitchen , meal center , or food kitchen is a place where food is offered to the hungry usually for free or sometimes at a below-market price . Frequently located in lower-income neighborhoods , soup kitchens are often staffed by volunteer organizations , such as church or community groups . Soup kitchens sometimes obtain food from a food bank for free or at a low price , because they are considered a charity , which makes it easier for them to feed the many people who require their services . Many historical and typical modern soup kitchens serve only soup ( hence its name ) , usually with some bread . But several establishments which refer to themselves as a soup kitchen also serve other types of food , so social scientists sometimes discuss them together with similar hunger relief agencies that provide more varied hot meals , like food kitchens and meal centers . While societies have been using various methods to share food with the hungry for millennia , the first soup kitchens in the modern sense may have emerged in the late 18th century . By the late 19th century , they were located in several American and European cities . In the United States and elsewhere , they became more prominent in the 20th century , especially during the Great Depression . With the much improved economic conditions that immediately followed World War II , soup kitchens became less widely used , at least in the advanced economies . In the United States , there was a resurgence in the use of soup kitchens following the cutbacks in welfare that were implemented in the early 1980s . In the 21st century , the use of soup kitchens expanded in both the United States and Europe , following lasting global increases in the price of food which began in late 2006 . Demand for their services grew as the Great Recession began to worsen economic conditions for those with lower incomes .",

Born on lands belonging to the twin monastery of Monkwearmouth-Jarrow in present-day Tyne and Wear , Bede was sent to Monkwearmouth at the age of seven and later joined Abbot Ceolfrith at Jarrow , both of whom survived a plague that struck in 686 , an outbreak that killed a majority of the population there . While he spent most of his life in the monastery , Bede travelled to several abbeys and monasteries across the British Isles , even visiting the archbishop of York and King Ceolwulf of Northumbria . He is well known as an author , teacher ( a student of one of his pupils was Alcuin ) , and scholar , and his most famous work , Ecclesiastical History of the English People , gained him the title The Father of English History . His ecumenical writings were extensive and included a number of Biblical commentaries and other theological works of exegetical erudition . Another important area of study for Bede was the academic discipline of computus , otherwise known to his contemporaries as the science of calculating calendar dates . One of the more important dates Bede tried to compute was Easter , an effort that was mired with controversy . He also helped establish the practice of dating forward from the birth of Christ ( Anno Domini - in the year of our Lord ) , a practice which eventually became commonplace in medieval Europe . Bede was one of the greatest teachers and writers of the Early Middle Ages and is considered by many historians to be the single most important scholar of antiquity for the period between the death of Pope Gregory I in 604 and the coronation of Charlemagne in 800 . In 1899 , Pope Leo XIII declared him a Doctor of the Church . He is the only native of Great Britain to achieve this designation ; Anselm of Canterbury , also a Doctor of the Church , was originally from Italy . Bede was moreover a skilled linguist and translator , and his work made the Latin and Greek writings of the early Church Fathers much more accessible to his fellow Anglo-Saxons , which contributed significantly to English Christianity .",

  "/wiki/Monkwearmouth_Station_Museum": "Monkwearmouth Railway Station served Monkwearmouth , Sunderland , England . It was built in 1848 to a design by Thomas Moore . and was once the main railway station in the city . The railway station closed in March 1967 and featured a restored booking office dating from the Edwardian period . The station was opened as a museum in 1973 . The Tyne and Wear Metro and mainline trains still pass through the station without stopping , but the Metro calls at St. Peter 's station a few hundred yards south of the old station , due to the platforms at Monkwearmouth being too narrow to serve as a Metro station . The museum is a Grade II* listed building . As well as the ticket office visitors can explore the Wagon Shed , Journeys Gallery and Children 's Gallery . The museum was temporarily closed from August 2005 until 2007 to allow repairs and refurbishment to take place . The museum was closed on 23 May 2017 because the roof , footbridge and platforms were in a very poor condition . The local council has agreed to get the station back open by 2019 , if funding is secured for a \u00a33.4 million refurbishment by 12 June 2018 . The station has since reopened as a museum dedicated to football .",
  "/wiki/Monkwearmouth": "Monkwearmouth is an area of Sunderland located at the north side of the mouth of the River Wear . It was one of the three original settlements on the banks of the River Wear along with Bishopwearmouth and Sunderland , the area now known as the East End . It includes the area around St. Peter 's Church , founded in 674 as part of Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey , and was once the main centre of Wearside shipbuilding and coalmining in the town .

  "/wiki/Sunderland,_Tyne_and_Wear": "Sunderland ( /\u02c8s\u028cnd\u0259rl\u0259nd/ ( listen ) ) is a city at the centre of the City of Sunderland metropolitan borough , in Tyne and Wear , England , 12 miles northeast of Durham and 10 miles southeast of Newcastle upon Tyne , at the mouth of the River Wear . Historically in County Durham , there were three original settlements by the mouth of the River Wear on the site of modern-day Sunderland . On the north side of the river , Monkwearmouth was settled in 674 when King Ecgfrith of Northumbria granted land to Benedict Biscop to found Monkwearmouth Monastery . In 685 , Ecgfrith further granted Biscop the land adjacent to the monastery on the south side of the river . As the river separated this land from the monastic community , it was henceforth referred to as the sunder-land , and would grow as a fishing settlement before being granted a charter in 1179 . West of the medieval village of Sunderland on the south bank , Bishopwearmouth was founded in 930 . Sunderland grew as a port , trading coal and salt . Ships began to be built on the river in the 14th century . By the 19th century , the port of Sunderland had absorbed Bishopwearmouth and Monkwearmouth , owing to the growing economic importance of the shipbuilding docks . Following the decline of the city 's traditional industries in the late 20th century , the area grew into a commercial centre for the automotive industry , science and technology and the service sector . Bede , sometimes called the father of English history , began his monastic career at Monkwearmouth monastery in Sunderland , before moving to the newly founded Jarrow monastery in 685 ( these monasteries together formed the dual Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey ) . It therefore seems likely that he was born in or near Sunderland .",
