He is known as the father of modern taxonomy . Many of his writings were in Latin , and his name is rendered in Latin as Carolus Linn\u00e6us ( after 1761 Carolus a Linn\u00e9 ) . Linnaeus was born in the countryside of Sm\u00e5land in southern Sweden . He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730 . He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738 , where he studied and also published the first edition of his Systema Naturae in the Netherlands . He then returned to Sweden where he became professor of medicine and botany at Uppsala . In the 1740s , he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals . In the 1750s and 1760s , he continued to collect and classify animals , plants , and minerals , while publishing several volumes . He was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe at the time of his death . Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau sent him the message : Tell him I know no greater man on earth . Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote : With the exception of Shakespeare and Spinoza , I know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more strongly .",

It is sometimes called dog-ape because of its dog-like muzzle , although it is no more closely related to apes than any other Old World monkey is . It is endemic to the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia . The moor macaque is threatened mostly due to habitat loss from an expanding human population and deforestation to increase agricultural land area .
