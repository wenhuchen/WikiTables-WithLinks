  "/wiki/Student_Nonviolent_Coordinating_Committee": "The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC , often pronounced /sn\u026ak/ SNIK ) was the principal channel of student commitment in the United States to the Civil Rights Movement during the 1960s . Emerging in 1960 from the student-led sit-ins at segregated lunch counters in Greensboro , North Carolina and Nashville , Tennessee , the Committee sought to coordinate and assist direct-action challenges to the civic segregation and political exclusion of African-Americans . From 1962 , with the support of the Voter Education Project , SNCC committed to the registration and mobilization of black voters in the Deep South . Affiliates such as the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and the Lowndes County Freedom Organization in Alabama increased dramatically the pressure on federal and state government to enforce constitutional protections . But by the mid-1960s the measured nature of the gains made , and the violence with which they were resisted , were generating dissent from the principles of non-violence , of white participation in the movement , and of field-driven , as opposed to national-office , leadership and direction . At the same time organizers were being lost to a de-segregating Democratic Party and to federally-funded anti-poverty programs . Following an aborted merger with the Black Panther Party in 1968 , SNCC effectively dissolved . SNCC is nonetheless credited in its brief existence with breaking down barriers , both institutional and psychological , to the empowerment of African-American communities . It is also seen as offering subsequent social and political movements templates for grassroots organizing and , consistent with the vision of the Committee 's early mentor , Ella Baker , for the broad and creative participation of women .",
  "/wiki/Black_Panther_Party": "The Black Panther Party ( BPP ) , originally the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense , was a revolutionary political organization founded by Bobby Seale and Huey Newton in October 1966 in Oakland , California . The party was active in the United States from 1966 until 1982 , with chapters in numerous major cities , and international chapters in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s , and in Algeria from 1969 to 1972 . At its inception on October 15 , 1966 , the Black Panther Party 's core practice was its armed citizens ' patrols ( copwatching ) to monitor the behavior of officers of the Oakland Police Department and challenge police brutality in the city . In 1969 , a variety of community social programs became a core activity . The Party instituted the Free Breakfast for Children Programs to address food injustice , and community health clinics for education and treatment of diseases including sickle cell anemia , tuberculosis , and later HIV/AIDS . Black Panther Party members were involved in many fatal firefights with police : Huey Newton allegedly killed officer John Frey in 1967 , and Eldridge Cleaver led an ambush in 1968 of Oakland police officers , in which two officers were wounded and Panther Bobby Hutton was killed . The party suffered many internal conflicts , resulting in the murders of Alex Rackley and Betty Van Patter . In 1967 , the Mulford Act was passed by the California legislature and signed into law by governor Ronald Reagan , establishing strict gun laws that stripped legal ownership of firearms from Black Panther members and prevented all citizens , black and white , from carrying firearms in public . In 1969 , Federal Bureau of Investigation Director J. Edgar Hoover described the party as the greatest threat to the internal security of the country . He developed and supervised an extensive counterintelligence program ( COINTELPRO ) of surveillance , infiltration , perjury , police harassment , and many other tactics , designed to undermine Panther leadership , incriminate and assassinate party members , discredit and criminalize the Party , and drain organizational resources and manpower . The program was responsible for the assassination of Fred Hampton , and is accused of assassinating other Black Panther members , including Mark Clark . Government persecution initially contributed to the party 's growth , as killings and arrests of Panthers increased its support among African Americans , and on the broad political left , who both valued the Panthers as a powerful force opposed to de facto segregation and the military draft .",
