  "/wiki/Sickle-cell_disease": "Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) is a group of blood disorders typically inherited from a person 's parents . The most common type is known as sickle cell anaemia ( SCA ) .

Problems in sickle cell disease typically begin around 5 to 6 months of age . A number of health problems may develop , such as attacks of pain ( sickle cell crisis ) , anemia , swelling in the hands and feet , bacterial infections and stroke . Long-term pain may develop as people get older . The average life expectancy in the developed world is 40 to 60 years . Sickle cell disease occurs when a person inherits two abnormal copies of the \u03b2-globin gene that makes haemoglobin , one from each parent . This gene occurs in chromosome 11 . Several subtypes exist , depending on the exact mutation in each haemoglobin gene . An attack can be set off by temperature changes , stress , dehydration , and high altitude .",

It has ultimate ( and largely discretionary ) appellate jurisdiction over all federal and state court cases that involve a point of federal law , and original jurisdiction over a narrow range of cases , specifically all Cases affecting Ambassadors , other public Ministers and Consuls , and those in which a State shall be Party . The Court holds the power of judicial review , the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the U.S. Constitution .

However , it may act only within the context of a case in an area of law over which it has jurisdiction . The Court may decide cases having political overtones , but it has ruled that it does not have power to decide non-justiciable political questions .

  "/wiki/Swann_v._Charlotte-Mecklenburg_Board_of_Education": "Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education , 402 U.S. 1 ( 1971 ) , was a landmark United States Supreme Court case dealing with the busing of students to promote integration in public schools . The Court held that busing was an appropriate remedy for the problem of racial imbalance in schools , even when the imbalance resulted from the selection of students based on geographic proximity to the school rather than from deliberate assignment based on race . This was done to ensure the schools would be properly integrated and that all students would receive equal educational opportunities regardless of their race . Judge John J. Parker of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit interpreted the Brown v. Board of Education case as a charge not to segregate rather than an order to integrate . In 1963 , the Court ruled in McNeese v. Board of Education and Goss v. Board of Education in favor of integration , and showed impatience with efforts to end segregation [ citation needed ] . In 1968 the Warren Court ruled in Green v. County School Board that freedom of choice plans were insufficient to eliminate segregation ; thus , it was necessary to take proactive steps to integrate schools . In United States v. Montgomery County Board of Education ( 1969 ) , Judge Frank Johnson 's desegregation order for teachers was upheld , allowing an approximate ratio of the races to be established by a district judge .",
