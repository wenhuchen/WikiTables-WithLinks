  "/wiki/Blaxploitation": "Blaxploitation or blacksploitation is an ethnic subgenre of the exploitation film that emerged in the United States during the early 1970s . The films , while popular , suffered backlash for disproportionate numbers of stereotypical film characters showing bad or questionable motives , including roles as criminals . However , the genre does rank among the first in which black characters and communities are the heroes and subjects of film and television , rather than sidekicks , villains , or victims of brutality . The genre 's inception coincides with the rethinking of race relations in the 1970s . Blaxploitation films were originally aimed at an urban African-American audience , but the genre 's audience appeal soon broadened across racial and ethnic lines . Hollywood realized the potential profit of expanding the audiences of blaxploitation films across those racial lines . Variety credited Sweet Sweetback 's Baadasssss Song and the less radical , Hollywood-financed film Shaft ( both released in 1971 ) with the invention of the blaxploitation genre .
