MusicBrainz captures information about artists , their recorded works , and the relationships between them . Recorded works entries capture at a minimum the album title , track titles , and the length of each track . These entries are maintained by volunteer editors who follow community written style guidelines . Recorded works can also store information about the release date and country , the CD ID , cover art , acoustic fingerprint , free-form annotation text and other metadata . As of 21 September 2018 [ update ] , MusicBrainz contained information about roughly 1.4 million artists , 2 million releases , and 19 million recordings .
