Initially a jazz bassist ( Last won the award for best bassist in Germany in each of the years 1950-1952 ) , his trademark happy music made his numerous albums best-sellers in Germany and the United Kingdom , with 65 of his albums reaching the charts in the UK alone . His composition Happy Heart became an international success in interpretations by Andy Williams and Petula Clark . Last is reported to have sold an estimated 200 million albums worldwide in his lifetime ( figures vary widely , for example British Hit Singles & Albums ( 2006 ) reports 100 million at that time ) , of which 80 million were sold by 1973 - and won numerous awards including 200 gold and 14 platinum discs in Germany , the International MIDEM Prize at MIDEM in 1969 , and West Germany 's highest civilian award , the Bundesverdienstkreuz ( Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany ) in 1978 .

His final UK performance was his 90th at London 's Royal Albert Hall , more than any other performer except Eric Clapton . Last 's trademark sound employed big band arrangements of well-known tunes with a jaunty dance beat , often heavy on bass and brass . Despite at times being derided by critics and purists as the king of elevator music or acoustic porridge , his style and music were popular in numerous countries and cultures , including Japan , the former Soviet Union , the USA and UK , and his native Germany , where it became the archetypal soundtrack of any German cellar bar party , and made him the most commercially successful bandleader of the second half of the 20th century .",
