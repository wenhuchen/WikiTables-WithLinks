He made many crucial contributions to the early development of all-electronic television . He is best known for his 1927 invention of the first fully functional all-electronic image pickup device ( video camera tube ) , the image dissector , as well as the first fully functional and complete all-electronic television system . Farnsworth developed a television system complete with receiver and camera - which he produced commercially through the Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation from 1938 to 1951 , in Fort Wayne , Indiana . In later life , Farnsworth invented a small nuclear fusion device , the Farnsworth-Hirsch fusor , employing inertial electrostatic confinement ( IEC ) . It was not a practical device for generating nuclear power , though it provides a viable source of neutrons . The design of this device has been the inspiration for other fusion approaches , including the Polywell reactor concept . Farnsworth held 300 patents , mostly in radio and television .",

  "/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Forces": "The United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF or AAF ) was the aerial warfare service component of the United States Army , and de facto aerial warfare service branch of the United States , during and immediately after World War II ( 1939/41-1945 ) , successor to the previous United States Army Air Corps , and the direct predecessor of the United States Air Force of today , one of the five uniformed military services . The AAF was a component of the United States Army , which on 2 March 1942 was divided functionally by executive order into three autonomous forces : the Army Ground Forces , the Services of Supply ( which in 1943 became the Army Service Forces ) , and the Army Air Forces . Each of these forces had a commanding general who reported directly to the Army Chief of Staff . The AAF administered all parts of military aviation formerly distributed among the Air Corps , General Headquarters Air Force , and the ground forces ' corps area commanders , and thus became the first air organization of the U.S. Army to control its own installations and support personnel . The peak size of the AAF during the Second World War was over 2.4 million men and women in service and nearly 80,000 aircraft by 1944 , and 783 domestic bases in December 1943 . By V-E Day , the Army Air Forces had 1.25 million men stationed overseas and operated from more than 1,600 airfields worldwide . The Army Air Forces was created in June 1941 to provide the air arm a greater autonomy in which to expand more efficiently , to provide a structure for the additional command echelons required by a vastly increased force , and to end an increasingly divisive administrative battle within the Army over control of aviation doctrine and organization that had been ongoing since the creation of an aviation section within the U.S. Army Signal Corps in 1914 . The AAF succeeded both the Air Corps , which had been the statutory military aviation branch since 1926 , and the GHQ Air Force , which had been activated in 1935 to quiet the demands of airmen for an independent Air Force similar to the Royal Air Force which had already been established in the United Kingdom . Although other nations already had separate air forces independent of their army or navy ( such as the British Royal Air Force and the German Luftwaffe ) , the AAF remained a part of the Army until a defense reorganization in the post-war period resulted in the passage by the United States Congress of the National Security Act of 1947 with the creation of an independent United States Air Force in September 1947 . In its expansion and conduct of the war , the AAF became more than just an arm of the greater organization . By the end of World War II , the Army Air Forces had become virtually an independent service . By regulation and executive order , it was a subordinate agency of the United States Department of War ( as were the Army Ground Forces and the Army Service Forces ) tasked only with organizing , training , and equipping combat units , and limited in responsibility to the continental United States .",
  "/wiki/Medal_of_Honor": "The Medal of Honor is the United States of America 's highest and most prestigious personal military decoration that may be awarded to recognize U.S. military service members who have distinguished themselves by acts of valor . The medal is normally awarded by the President of the United States in the name of the U.S. Congress . Because the medal is presented in the name of Congress , it is often referred erroneously as the Congressional Medal of Honor . However , the official name of the current award is Medal of Honor . Within the United States Code the medal is referred to as the Medal of Honor , and less frequently as Congressional Medal of Honor . U.S. awards , including the Medal of Honor , do not have post-nominal titles , and while there is no official abbreviation , the most common abbreviations are MOH and MH . There are three versions of the medal , one each for the Army , Navy and Air Force . Personnel of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard receive the Navy version while members of the Space Force receive the Air Force version . The Medal of Honor was introduced for the Navy in 1861 , soon followed by an Army version in 1862 . The Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States ' armed forces . The President typically presents the Medal at a formal ceremony intended to represent the gratitude of the U.S. people , with posthumous presentations made to the primary next of kin . According to the Medal of Honor Historical Society of the United States , there have been 3,525 Medals of Honor awarded to 3,506 individuals since the decoration 's creation , with over 40% awarded for actions during the American Civil War .",

  "/wiki/Beat_Generation": "The Beat Generation was a literary movement started by a group of authors whose work explored and influenced American culture and politics in the post-war era . The bulk of their work was published and popularized throughout the 1950s . The central elements of Beat culture are the rejection of standard narrative values , making a spiritual quest , the exploration of American and Eastern religions , the rejection of economic materialism , explicit portrayals of the human condition , experimentation with psychedelic drugs , and sexual liberation and exploration . Allen Ginsberg 's Howl ( 1956 ) , William S. Burroughs ' Naked Lunch ( 1959 ) and Jack Kerouac 's On the Road ( 1957 ) are among the best known examples of Beat literature . Both Howl and Naked Lunch were the focus of obscenity trials that ultimately helped to liberalize publishing in the United States . The members of the Beat Generation developed a reputation as new bohemian hedonists , who celebrated non-conformity and spontaneous creativity . The core group of Beat Generation authors - Herbert Huncke , Ginsberg , Burroughs , Lucien Carr , and Kerouac - met in 1944 in and around the Columbia University campus in New York City . Later , in the mid-1950s , the central figures , with the exception of Burroughs and Carr , ended up together in San Francisco , where they met and became friends of figures associated with the San Francisco Renaissance . In the 1960s , elements of the expanding Beat movement were incorporated into the hippie and larger counterculture movements . Neal Cassady , as the driver for Ken Kesey 's bus Further , was the primary bridge between these two generations . Ginsberg 's work also became an integral element of early 1960s hippie culture .",

While traveling in Foreman 's VW bus from the El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve in northern Mexico to Albuquerque , New Mexico , the group pledged , No compromise in defense of Mother Earth ! . The co-founders of the group were called to action during the second Roadless Area Review and Evaluation ( RARE II ) by the U.S. Forest Service , which they considered a sell-out by mainstream environmental advocates . The activists envisioned a revolutionary movement , with the goal to set aside multi-million-acre ecological preserves all across the United States . Their ideas drew upon the concepts of conservation biology , which had been developing for over twenty years by notable scientists like E. O. Wilson ; however , mainstream environmental groups were slow to embrace the new science . These events and ideologies coalesced after a grueling hike , as the men were headed toward Albuquerque .

  "/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) is the domestic intelligence and security service of the United States and its principal federal law enforcement agency . Operating under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Justice , the FBI is also a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community and reports to both the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence . A leading U.S. counter-terrorism , counterintelligence , and criminal investigative organization , the FBI has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes . Although many of the FBI 's functions are unique , its activities in support of national security are comparable to those of the British MI5 and the Russian FSB . Unlike the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , which has no law enforcement authority and is focused on intelligence collection abroad , the FBI is primarily a domestic agency , maintaining 56 field offices in major cities throughout the United States , and more than 400 resident agencies in smaller cities and areas across the nation . At an FBI field office , a senior-level FBI officer concurrently serves as the representative of the Director of National Intelligence . Despite its domestic focus , the FBI also maintains a significant international footprint , operating 60 Legal Attache ( LEGAT ) offices and 15 sub-offices in U.S. embassies and consulates across the globe . These foreign offices exist primarily for the purpose of coordination with foreign security services and do not usually conduct unilateral operations in the host countries . The FBI can and does at times carry out secret activities overseas , just as the CIA has a limited domestic function ; these activities generally require coordination across government agencies . The FBI was established in 1908 as the Bureau of Investigation , the BOI or BI for short . Its name was changed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) in 1935 . The FBI headquarters is the J. Edgar Hoover Building , located in Washington , D.C ."
