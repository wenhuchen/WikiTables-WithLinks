  "/wiki/Alberta": "Alberta is a province of Canada . With an estimated population of 4,067,175 as of 2016 census , it is Canada 's fourth most populous province and the most populous of Canada 's three prairie provinces . Its area is about 660,000 square kilometres ( 250,000 sq mi ) . Alberta and its neighbour Saskatchewan were districts of the Northwest Territories until they were established as provinces on September 1 , 1905 . The premier is Jason Kenney as of April 30 , 2019 . Alberta is bordered by the provinces of British Columbia to the west and Saskatchewan to the east , the Northwest Territories to the north , and the U.S. state of Montana to the south . Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single U.S. state and one of only two landlocked provinces . It has a predominantly humid continental climate , with stark contrasts over a year ; but seasonal temperature average swings are smaller than in areas further east , due to winters being warmed by occasional chinook winds bringing sudden warming . Alberta 's capital , Edmonton , is near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canada 's crude oil , the Athabasca oil sands and other northern resource industries . About 290 km ( 180 mi ) south of the capital is Calgary , the largest city in Alberta . Calgary and Edmonton centre Alberta 's two census metropolitan areas , both of which have populations exceeding one million , while the province has 16 census agglomerations . Tourist destinations in the province include Banff , Canmore , Drumheller , Jasper , Sylvan Lake and Lake Louise .",
  "/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting": "Instant-runoff voting ( IRV ) is a type of ranked preferential voting method used in single-seat elections with more than two candidates . Instead of indicating support for only one candidate , voters in IRV elections can rank the candidates in order of preference . Ballots are initially counted for each voter 's top choice . If a candidate has more than half of the vote based on first-choices , that candidate wins . If not , then the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated . The voters who selected the defeated candidate as a first choice then have their votes added to the totals of their next choice . This process continues until a candidate has more than half of the votes . When the field is reduced to two , it has become an instant runoff that allows a comparison of the top two candidates head-to-head . Compared to plurality voting , IRV can reduce the effect of vote-splitting when multiple candidates earn support from like-minded voters . Instant-runoff voting is used in national elections in several countries . For example , it is used to elect members of the Australian House of Representatives and at least one house of all Australian state parliaments ; the President of India and members of legislative councils in India ; the President of Ireland ; members of Congress in Maine in the United States ; and the Parliament in Papua New Guinea . The method is also used in local elections around the world , including New York City offices starting in 2021 .",
  "/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory": "The Australian Capital Territory , formerly known as the Federal Capital Territory until 1938 and commonly referred to as the ACT , is a federal territory of Australia containing the Australian capital city of Canberra and some surrounding townships . It is located in the south-east of the country and is an enclave within the state of New South Wales . Founded after Federation as the seat of government for the new nation , all important institutions of the Australian federal government are centred in the territory . On 1 January 1901 , federation of the colonies of Australia was achieved . Section 125 of the new Australian Constitution provided that land , situated in New South Wales and at least 100 miles ( 160 km ) from Sydney , would be ceded to the new federal government . Following discussion and exploration of various areas within New South Wales , the Seat of Government Act 1908 was passed in 1908 which specified a capital in the Yass-Canberra region . The territory was transferred to the Commonwealth by New South Wales in 1911 , two years prior to the capital city being founded and formally named as Canberra in 1913 . While the overwhelming majority of the population reside in the city of Canberra in the ACT 's north-east , the territory also includes some surrounding townships such as Williamsdale , Naas , Uriarra , Tharwa and Hall . The ACT also includes the Namadgi National Park which comprises the majority of land area of the territory . Despite a common misconception , the Jervis Bay Territory is not part of the ACT although the laws of the Australian Capital Territory apply as if Jervis Bay did form part of the ACT . The territory has a relatively dry , continental climate experiencing warm to hot summers and cool to cold winters . The Australian Capital Territory is home to many important institutions of the federal government , national monuments and museums .",
  "/wiki/Single_transferable_vote": "The single transferable vote ( STV ) is a proportional voting system designed to achieve or closely approach proportional representation through voters ranking candidates in multi-seat organizations or constituencies ( voting districts ) . There are various ways of counting votes under STV , as described below . Under STV , each elector ( voter ) gets a single vote in an election electing multiple winners . Each elector marks their ballot for the most preferred candidate and also marks back-up preferences . The vote goes to the voter 's first preference if possible , but if their first preference is eliminated , instead of being thrown away , the vote is transferred to a back-up preference , with the vote being assigned to the voter 's second , third , or lower choice or being apportioned fractionally to different candidates . The counting process works thus : votes are totalled , and a quota ( the minimum number of votes required to win a seat ) is derived . [ note 1 ] If the elector 's first-ranked candidate achieves the quota , the candidate is declared elected ; and , in some STV systems , any surplus vote is transferred to other candidates in proportion to the next back-up preference marked on the ballots . If more candidates than seats remain , the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated , with the votes in their favour being transferred to other candidates as determined by the voters ' next back-up preference . These elections and eliminations , and vote transfers if applicable , continue until enough candidates exceed quota to fill all the seats or until there are only as many remaining candidates as there are unfilled seats , at which point the remaining candidates are declared elected . The specific method of transferring votes varies in different systems ( see \u00a7 Counting methods ) . Advocates for STV say that it enables votes to be cast for individual candidates rather than for parties and party machine-controlled party lists , and - compared to first-past-the-post ( FPTP ) voting - reduces wasted votes ( votes being wasted on losers and surplus votes being wasted on sure winners ) by transferring them to other preferred candidates . STV also provides approximately proportional representation , even in non-partisan elections , ensuring that minority factions have some representation .",

With an estimated population of 5.1 million as of 2019 [ update ] , it is Canada 's third-most populous province . The first British settlement in the area was Fort Victoria , established in 1843 , which gave rise to the City of Victoria , at first the capital of the separate Colony of Vancouver Island . Subsequently , on the mainland , the Colony of British Columbia ( 1858-1866 ) was founded by Richard Clement Moody and the Royal Engineers , Columbia Detachment , in response to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush . Moody was Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for the Colony and the first Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia : he was hand-picked by the Colonial Office in London to transform British Columbia into the British Empire 's bulwark in the farthest west , and to found a second England on the shores of the Pacific . Moody selected the site for and founded the original capital of British Columbia , New Westminster , established the Cariboo Road and Stanley Park , and designed the first version of the Coat of arms of British Columbia . Port Moody is named after him . In 1866 , Vancouver Island became part of the colony of British Columbia , and Victoria became the united colony 's capital . In 1871 , British Columbia became the sixth province of Canada . Its Latin motto is Splendor sine occasu ( Splendour without Diminishment ) . The capital of British Columbia is Victoria , the fifteenth-largest metropolitan region in Canada , named for Queen Victoria , who ruled during the creation of the original colonies .

Located in New England , it is bordered by New Hampshire to the west , the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast , and the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Qu\u00e9bec to the northeast and northwest , respectively . Maine is the only state to border exactly one other state , is the easternmost among the contiguous United States , and is the northernmost state east of the Great Lakes . Maine is known for its jagged , rocky coastline ; low , rolling mountains ; heavily forested interior ; and picturesque waterways , as well as its seafood cuisine , especially lobster and clams . There is a humid continental climate throughout most of the state , including coastal areas . Maine 's most populous city is Portland and its capital is Augusta . For thousands of years , indigenous peoples were the only inhabitants of the territory that is now Maine . At the time of European arrival in what is now Maine , several Algonquian-speaking peoples inhabited the area . The first European settlement in the area was by the French in 1604 on Saint Croix Island , by Pierre Dugua , Sieur de Mons . The first English settlement was the short-lived Popham Colony , established by the Plymouth Company in 1607 . A number of English settlements were established along the coast of Maine in the 1620s , although the rugged climate , deprivations , and conflict with the local peoples caused many to fail over the years .",
  "/wiki/Maine_Question_5,_2016": "Maine Question 5 , formally An Act to Establish Ranked-Choice Voting , is a citizen-initiated referendum question that qualified for the Maine November 8 , 2016 statewide ballot . It was approved by a vote of 52% in favor , 48% opposed . It sought to change how most Maine elections will be conducted from a plurality voting system to a ranked-choice voting system ( RCV , also known as instant runoff voting ) . It appeared on the ballot along with elections for President of the United States , Maine 's two U.S. House seats , the legislature , five other ballot questions , and various local elections . The referendum was successful , making Maine the first state to use ranked choice voting for its federal elections . An advisory opinion by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court , issued on May 23 , 2017 , stated that the court would rule ranked-choice voting unconstitutional if it came before them , with respect to elections for state offices . This led the Maine Legislature to vote to delay its implementation until 2021 to allow time for a Constitutional amendment to be passed to permit it . Supporters gathered signatures to force a successful people 's veto referendum on the matter in order to prevent the delay .",

It qualified because supporters of the original referendum collected the necessary number of signatures from registered Maine voters . This vote coincided with primary elections in which party nominees for governor , U.S. Senate , U.S. House , and the Maine Legislature were chosen to run in general elections on November 6 . The people 's veto was passed , with 53.88% of Maine voters voting Yes . This restored ranked choice voting for primary and federal elections .",

Manitoba covers 649,950 square kilometres ( 250,900 sq mi ) with a widely varied landscape , stretching from the northern oceanic coastline to the southern border with the United States . The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south . Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived on two major river systems , what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system . A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson 's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert 's Land . During the next 200 years , communities continued to grow and evolve , with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg . The assertion of M\u00e9tis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba . There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the M\u00e9tis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion . The resolution of the assertion of the right to representation led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 that created the province .

  "/wiki/Contingent_vote": "The contingent vote , also known as top-two IRV is an electoral system used to elect a single winner . It is a variation of instant-runoff voting ( IRV ) , in which the voter ranks the candidates in order of preference . Under the contingent vote , there is a first round in which a candidate requires a majority of first preference votes to win . If no candidate has a majority , then all but the two leading candidates are eliminated and there is a second count , where the votes of those who supported eliminated candidates are distributed among the two remaining candidates . This ensures that one candidate achieves a majority . The contingent vote differs from IRV which allows for many rounds of counting , eliminating only one weakest candidate each round . The contingent vote can also be considered a compressed form of the two-round system ( runoff system ) , in which both 'rounds ' occur without the need for voters to go to the polls twice . Today , a special variant of the contingent vote is used to elect the President of Sri Lanka . Another variant , called the supplementary vote , is used to pick directly elected mayors and police and crime commissioners in England . In the past the ordinary form of the contingent vote was used to elect the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 1892 to 1942 . To date , this has been the longest continuous use of the system anywhere in the world . It was also used in the US state of Alabama in the 1920s .",

The city is midway between Toronto , Ontario and Montreal , Quebec . The Thousand Islands tourist region is nearby to the east . Kingston is nicknamed the Limestone City because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local limestone . Growing European exploration in the 17th century , and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade , led to the founding of a French trading post and military fort at a site known as Cataraqui ( generally pronounced kah-tah-ROCK-way ) in 1673 . This outpost , called Fort Cataraqui , and later Fort Frontenac , became a focus for settlement . Cataraqui would be renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort , and Loyalists began settling the region in the 1780s . Kingston was named the first capital of the United Province of Canada on February 10 , 1841 . While its time as a capital city was short ( ending in 1844 ) , the community has remained an important military installation . Kingston was the county seat of Frontenac County until 1998 .

Victoria is bordered by Bass Strait and Tasmania to the south , [ note 1 ] New South Wales to the north , the Tasman Sea ( a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean ) to the east , and South Australia to the west . The area that is now known as Victoria is the home of many Aboriginal people groups , including the Boon wurrung , the Bratauolung , the Djadjawurrung , the Gunai/Kurnai , the Gunditjmara , the Taungurong , the Wathaurong , the Wurundjeri , and the Yorta Yorta . There were more than 30 Aboriginal languages spoken in the area prior to the European settlement of Australia . The Kulin nation is an alliance of five Aboriginal nations which makes up much of the central part of the state . With Great Britain having claimed the half of the Australian continent that is east of the 135th meridian east in 1788 , Victoria formed part of the wider colony of New South Wales . The first European settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay , and much of what is now Victoria was included in 1836 in the Port Phillip District , an administrative division of New South Wales . Named in honour of Queen Victoria , who signed the division 's separation from New South Wales , the colony was officially established in 1851 and achieved self government in 1855 . The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony , and by the time of the Federation of Australia in 1901 , Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia . Melbourne served as federal capital of Australia until the construction of Canberra in 1927 , with the Federal Parliament meeting in Melbourne 's Parliament House and all principal offices of the federal government being based in Melbourne .",

It is bounded by the Indian Ocean to the north and west , and the Southern Ocean to the south , [ b ] the Northern Territory to the north-east , and South Australia to the south-east . Western Australia is Australia 's largest state , with a total land area of 2,529,875 square kilometres ( 976,790 sq mi ) , and the second-largest country subdivision in the world , surpassed only by Russia 's Sakha Republic . The state has about 2.6 million inhabitants - around 11 percent of the national total - of whom the vast majority ( 92 per cent ) live in the south-west corner , 79 per cent of the population living in the Perth area , leaving the remainder of the state sparsely populated . The first European visitor to Western Australia was the Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog , who visited the Western Australian coast in 1616 . The first European settlement of Western Australia occurred following the landing by Major Edmund Lockyer on 26 December 1826 of an expedition on behalf of the New South Wales colonial government . He established a convict-supported military garrison at King George III Sound , at present-day Albany , and on 21 January 1827 formally took possession of the western third of the continent for the British Crown . This was followed by the establishment of the Swan River Colony in 1829 , including the site of the present-day capital , Perth . York was the first inland settlement in Western Australia . Situated 97 kilometres ( 60 miles ) east of Perth , it was settled on 16 September 1831 . Western Australia achieved responsible government in 1890 and federated with the other British colonies in Australia in 1901 . Today , its economy mainly relies on mining , oil and gas , services and construction ."
