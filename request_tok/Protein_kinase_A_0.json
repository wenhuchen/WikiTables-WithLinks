  "/wiki/Cell_type": "A cell type is a classification used to distinguish between morphologically or phenotypically distinct cell forms within a species . A multicellular organism may contain a number of widely differing and specialized cell types , such as muscle cells and skin cells in humans , that differ both in appearance and function yet are genetically identical . Cells are able to be of the same genotype , but different cell type due to the differential regulation of the genes they contain . Classification of a specific cell type is often done through the use of microscopy ( such as those from the cluster of differentiation family that are commonly used for this purpose in immunology ) . Recent developments in single cell RNA sequencing facilitated classification of cell types based on shared gene expression patterns . This has led to the discovery of many new cell types in e.g . mouse cortex , hippocampus , dorsal root ganglion and spinal cord . Animals have evolved a greater diversity of cell types in a multicellular body ( 100-150 different cell types ) , compared with 10-20 in plants , fungi , and protoctists .",
  "/wiki/Ligands": "In coordination chemistry , a ligand [ help 1 ] is an ion or molecule ( functional group ) that binds to a central metal atom to form a coordination complex . The bonding with the metal generally involves formal donation of one or more of the ligand 's electron pairs . The nature of metal-ligand bonding can range from covalent to ionic . Furthermore , the metal-ligand bond order can range from one to three . Ligands are viewed as Lewis bases , although rare cases are known to involve Lewis acidic ligands . Metals and metalloids are bound to ligands in virtually all circumstances , although gaseous naked metal ions can be generated in a high vacuum . Ligands in a complex dictate the reactivity of the central atom , including ligand substitution rates , the reactivity of the ligands themselves , and redox . Ligand selection is a critical consideration in many practical areas , including bioinorganic and medicinal chemistry , homogeneous catalysis , and environmental chemistry . Ligands are classified in many ways , including : charge , size ( bulk ) , the identity of the coordinating atom ( s ) , and the number of electrons donated to the metal ( denticity or hapticity ) . The size of a ligand is indicated by its cone angle .",

Coupling with G proteins , they are called seven-transmembrane receptors because they pass through the cell membrane seven times . G protein-coupled receptors are found only in eukaryotes , including yeast , choanoflagellates , and animals . The ligands that bind and activate these receptors include light-sensitive compounds , odors , pheromones , hormones , and neurotransmitters , and vary in size from small molecules to peptides to large proteins .

Adrenaline is normally produced by both the adrenal glands and a small number of neurons in the medulla oblongata , where it acts as a neurotransmitter involved in regulating visceral functions ( e.g. , respiration ) . It plays an important role in the fight-or-flight response by increasing blood flow to muscles , output of the heart , pupil dilation response and blood sugar level . It does this by binding to alpha and beta receptors . It is found in many animals and some single-celled organisms . Polish physiologist Napoleon Cybulski first isolated epinephrine in 1895 .",

Many cells have these receptors , and the binding of a catecholamine to the receptor will generally stimulate the sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) . The SNS is responsible for the fight-or-flight response , which is triggered by experiences such as exercise or fear-causing situations . This response dilates pupils , increases heart rate , mobilizes energy , and diverts blood flow from non-essential organs to skeletal muscle . These effects together tend to increase physical performance momentarily .",
  "/wiki/Glucagon": "Glucagon is a peptide hormone , produced by alpha cells of the pancreas . It works to raise the concentration of glucose and fatty acids in the bloodstream , and is considered to be the main catabolic hormone of the body . It is also used as a medication to treat a number of health conditions . Its effect is opposite to that of insulin , which lowers extracellular glucose . It is produced from proglucagon , encoded by the GCG gene . The pancreas releases glucagon when the concentration of insulin ( and indirectly glucose ) in the bloodstream falls too low . Glucagon causes the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose , which is released into the bloodstream . High blood-glucose levels , on the other hand , stimulate the release of insulin . Insulin allows glucose to be taken up and used by insulin-dependent tissues . Thus , glucagon and insulin are part of a feedback system that keeps blood glucose levels stable . Glucagon increases energy expenditure and is elevated under conditions of stress . Glucagon belongs to the secretin family of hormones .",

Lipases perform essential roles in digestion , transport and processing of dietary lipids ( e.g . triglycerides , fats , oils ) in most , if not all , living organisms . Genes encoding lipases are even present in certain viruses . Most lipases act at a specific position on the glycerol backbone of a lipid substrate ( A1 , A2 or A3 ) ( small intestine ) . For example , human pancreatic lipase ( HPL ) , which is the main enzyme that breaks down dietary fats in the human digestive system , converts triglyceride substrates found in ingested oils to monoglycerides and two fatty acids . Several other types of lipase activities exist in nature , such as phospholipases and sphingomyelinases ; however , these are usually treated separately from conventional lipases . Some lipases are expressed and secreted by pathogenic organisms during an infection . In particular , Candida albicans has many different lipases , possibly reflecting broad-lipolytic activity , which may contribute to the persistence and virulence of C. albicans in human tissue .",

Glucose for metabolism is partially stored as a polymer , in plants mainly as starch and amylopectin and in animals as glycogen . Glucose circulates in the blood of animals as blood sugar . The naturally occurring form of glucose is d-glucose , while l-glucose is produced synthetically in comparatively small amounts and is of lesser importance . Glucose is a monosaccharide containing six carbon atoms and an aldehyde group and is therefore referred to as an aldohexose . The glucose molecule can exist in an open-chain ( acyclic ) and ring ( cyclic ) form , the latter being the result of an intramolecular reaction between the aldehyde C atom and the C-5 hydroxyl group to form an intramolecular hemiacetal . In water solution both forms are in equilibrium and at pH 7 the cyclic one is the predominant . Glucose is a primary source of energy for living organisms .",

  "/wiki/Glycolysis": "Glycolysis ( from glycose , an older term for glucose + -lysis degradation ) is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose C6H12O6 , into pyruvate , CH3COCOO\u2212 ( pyruvic acid ) , and a hydrogen ion , H+ . The free energy released in this process is used to form the high-energy molecules ATP ( adenosine triphosphate ) and NADH ( reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ) . Glycolysis is a sequence of ten enzyme-catalyzed reactions . Most monosaccharides , such as fructose and galactose , can be converted to one of these intermediates . The intermediates may also be directly useful rather than just utilized as steps in the overall reaction . For example , the intermediate dihydroxyacetone phosphate ( DHAP ) is a source of the glycerol that combines with fatty acids to form fat . Glycolysis is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway . The wide occurrence of glycolysis indicates that it is an ancient metabolic pathway . Indeed , the reactions that constitute glycolysis and its parallel pathway , the pentose phosphate pathway , occur metal-catalyzed under the oxygen-free conditions of the Archean oceans , also in the absence of enzymes . In most organisms , glycolysis occurs in the cytosol . The most common type of glycolysis is the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas ( EMP pathway ) , which was discovered by Gustav Embden , Otto Meyerhof , and Jakub Karol Parnas .

  "/wiki/Phosphofructokinase_2": "Phosphofructokinase-2 ( 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase , PFK-2 ) or fructose bisphosphatase-2 ( FBPase-2 ) , is an enzyme indirectly responsible for regulating the rates of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in cells . It catalyzes formation and degradation of a significant allosteric regulator , fructose-2,6-bisphosphate ( Fru-2,6-P2 ) from substrate fructose-6-phosphate . Fru-2,6-P2 contributes to the rate-determining step of glycolysis as it activates enzyme phosphofructokinase 1 in the glycolysis pathway , and inhibits fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 in gluconeogenesis . Since Fru-2,6-P2 differentially regulates glycolysis and gluconeogenesis , it can act as a key signal to switch between the opposing pathways . Because PFK-2 produces Fru-2,6-P2 in response to hormonal signaling , metabolism can be more sensitively and efficiently controlled to align with the organism 's glycolytic needs . PFK-2 is known as the bifunctional enzyme because of its notable structure : though both are located on one protein homodimer , its two domains act as independently functioning enzymes . One terminus serves as a kinase domain ( for PFK-2 ) while the other terminus acts as a phosphatase domain ( FBPase-2 ) . In mammals , genetic mechanisms encode different PFK-2 isoforms to accommodate tissue specific needs . While general function remains the same , isoforms feature slight differences in enzymatic properties and are controlled by different methods of regulation ; these differences are discussed below .",

It is composed of individual heart muscle cells ( cardiomyocytes ) joined together by intercalated discs , encased by collagen fibers and other substances that form the extracellular matrix . Cardiac muscle contracts in a similar manner to skeletal muscle , although with some important differences . Electrical stimulation in the form of an action potential triggers the release of calcium from the cell 's internal calcium store , the sarcoplasmic reticulum . The rise in calcium causes the cell 's myofilaments to slide past each other in a process called excitation contraction coupling . Diseases of the heart muscle are of major importance .

The circulatory system includes the lymphatic system , which circulates lymph . The passage of lymph takes much longer than that of blood . Blood is a fluid consisting of plasma , red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets that is circulated by the heart through the vertebrate vascular system , carrying oxygen and nutrients to and waste materials away from all body tissues . Lymph is essentially recycled excess blood plasma after it has been filtered from the interstitial fluid ( between cells ) and returned to the lymphatic system . The cardiovascular ( from Latin words meaning heart and vessel ) system comprises the blood , heart , and blood vessels . The lymph , lymph nodes , and lymph vessels form the lymphatic system , which returns filtered blood plasma from the interstitial fluid ( between cells ) as lymph . The circulatory system of the blood is seen as having two components , a systemic circulation and a pulmonary circulation . While humans , as well as other vertebrates , have a closed cardiovascular system ( meaning that the blood never leaves the network of arteries , veins and capillaries ) , some invertebrate groups have an open cardiovascular system . The lymphatic system , on the other hand , is an open system providing an accessory route for excess interstitial fluid to be returned to the blood .

The main function of the SR is to store calcium ions ( Ca2+ ) . Calcium ion levels are kept relatively constant , with the concentration of calcium ions within a cell being 100,000 times smaller than the concentration of calcium ions outside the cell . This means that small increases in calcium ions within the cell are easily detected and can bring about important cellular changes ( the calcium is said to be a second messenger ; see calcium in biology for more details ) . Calcium is used to make calcium carbonate ( found in chalk ) and calcium phosphate , two compounds that the body uses to make teeth and bones . This means that too much calcium within the cells can lead to hardening ( calcification ) of certain intracellular structures , including the mitochondria , leading to cell death . Therefore , it is vital that calcium ion levels are controlled tightly , and can be released into the cell when necessary and then removed from the cell .",

Applied topically , the researchers found PGD2 prevents hair growth , and mice that were genetically inclined to produce higher levels of PGD2 had inhibited hair growth . The researchers also found PGD2 levels were much higher in balding scalp tissue than nonbalding scalp tissue , through increased levels of prostaglandin D2 synthase . The paper suggested that inhibition of hair growth involved binding of PGD2 to a receptor called GPR44 , and that GPR44 therefore would be a therapeutic target for androgenic alopecia in both men and women with hair loss and thinning .

  "/wiki/Vasodilation": "Vasodilation is the widening of blood vessels . It results from relaxation of smooth muscle cells within the vessel walls , in particular in the large veins , large arteries , and smaller arterioles . The process is the opposite of vasoconstriction , which is the narrowing of blood vessels . When blood vessels dilate , the flow of blood is increased due to a decrease in vascular resistance and increase in cardiac output [ further explanation needed ] . Therefore , dilation of arterial blood vessels ( mainly the arterioles [ citation needed ] ) decreases blood pressure . The response may be intrinsic ( due to local processes in the surrounding tissue ) or extrinsic ( due to hormones or the nervous system ) . In addition , the response may be localized to a specific organ ( depending on the metabolic needs of a particular tissue , as during strenuous exercise ) , or it may be systemic ( seen throughout the entire systemic circulation ) . Endogenous substances and drugs that cause vasodilation are termed vasodilators . Such vasoactivity is necessary for homeostasis ( keeping the body running normally ) .",

  "/wiki/Liver": "The liver is an organ only found in vertebrates which detoxifies various metabolites , synthesizes proteins and produces biochemicals necessary for digestion and growth . In humans , it is located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen , below the diaphragm . Its other roles in metabolism include the regulation of glycogen storage , decomposition of red blood cells and the production of hormones . The liver is an accessory digestive organ that produces bile , a fluid containing cholesterol and bile acids , and an alkaline compound which helps the breakdown of fat . Bile aids in digestion via the emulsification of lipids . The gallbladder , a small pouch that sits just under the liver , stores bile produced by the liver which is afterwards moved to the small intestine to complete digestion . The liver 's highly specialized tissue consisting of mostly hepatocytes regulates a wide variety of high-volume biochemical reactions , including the synthesis and breakdown of small and complex molecules , many of which are necessary for normal vital functions . Estimates regarding the organ 's total number of functions vary , but textbooks generally cite it being around 500 . Terminology related to the liver often starts in hepat- from \u1f21\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf- , from the Greek word for liver . It is not yet known how to compensate for the absence of liver function in the long term , although liver dialysis techniques can be used in the short term . Artificial livers are yet to be developed to promote long-term replacement in the absence of the liver . As of 2018 [ update ] , liver transplantation is the only option for complete liver failure .",
  "/wiki/Gluconeogenesis": "Gluconeogenesis ( GNG ) is a metabolic pathway that results in the generation of glucose from certain non-carbohydrate carbon substrates . From breakdown of proteins , these substrates include glucogenic amino acids ( although not ketogenic amino acids ) ; from breakdown of lipids ( such as triglycerides ) , they include glycerol , odd-chain fatty acids ( although not even-chain fatty acids , see below ) ; and from other steps in metabolism they include pyruvate and lactate . Gluconeogenesis is one of several main mechanisms used by humans and many other animals to maintain blood glucose levels , avoiding low levels ( hypoglycemia ) . Other means include the degradation of glycogen ( glycogenolysis ) and fatty acid catabolism . Gluconeogenesis is a ubiquitous process , present in plants , animals , fungi , bacteria , and other microorganisms . In vertebrates , gluconeogenesis takes place mainly in the liver and , to a lesser extent , in the cortex of the kidneys . In ruminants , this tends to be a continuous process . In many other animals , the process occurs during periods of fasting , starvation , low-carbohydrate diets , or intense exercise . The process is highly endergonic until it is coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP or GTP , effectively making the process exergonic . For example , the pathway leading from pyruvate to glucose-6-phosphate requires 4 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of GTP to proceed spontaneously . Gluconeogenesis is often associated with ketosis . Gluconeogenesis is also a target of therapy for type 2 diabetes , such as the antidiabetic drug , metformin , which inhibits glucose formation and stimulates glucose uptake by cells .",

The ventral striatum and dorsal striatum collectively form the striatum , which is the main component of the basal ganglia . The dopaminergic neurons of the mesolimbic pathway project onto the GABAergic medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle .

In addition , part of the nucleus accumbens core is centrally involved in the induction of slow-wave sleep . The nucleus accumbens plays a lesser role in processing fear ( a form of aversion ) , impulsivity , and the placebo effect . It is involved in the encoding of new motor programs as well .",
  "/wiki/Nervous_system": "The nervous system is a highly complex part of an animal that coordinates its actions and sensory information by transmitting signals to and from different parts of its body . The nervous system detects environmental changes that impact the body , then works in tandem with the endocrine system to respond to such events . Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 550 to 600 million years ago . In vertebrates it consists of two main parts , the central nervous system ( CNS ) and the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) . The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord . The PNS consists mainly of nerves , which are enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons , that connect the CNS to every other part of the body . Nerves that transmit signals from the brain are called motor or efferent nerves , while those nerves that transmit information from the body to the CNS are called sensory or afferent . Spinal nerves serve both functions and are called mixed nerves . The PNS is divided into three separate subsystems , the somatic , autonomic , and enteric nervous systems . Somatic nerves mediate voluntary movement . The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems . The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy , while the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state .",
  "/wiki/Dopamine": "Dopamine ( DA , a contraction of 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine ) is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families . It functions both as a hormone and a neurotransmitter , and plays several important roles in the brain and body . It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical L-DOPA , which is synthesized in the brain and kidneys . Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals . In the brain , dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter - a chemical released by neurons ( nerve cells ) to send signals to other nerve cells . The brain includes several distinct dopamine pathways , one of which plays a major role in the motivational component of reward-motivated behavior . The anticipation of most types of rewards increases the level of dopamine in the brain , [ failed verification ] and many addictive drugs increase dopamine release or block its reuptake into neurons following release . Other brain dopamine pathways are involved in motor control and in controlling the release of various hormones . These pathways and cell groups form a dopamine system which is neuromodulatory . In popular culture and media , dopamine is usually seen as the main chemical of pleasure , but the current opinion in pharmacology is that dopamine instead confers motivational salience ; in other words , dopamine signals the perceived motivational prominence ( i.e. , the desirability or aversiveness ) of an outcome , which in turn propels the organism 's behavior toward or away from achieving that outcome . Outside the central nervous system , dopamine functions primarily as a local paracrine messenger . In blood vessels , it inhibits norepinephrine release and acts as a vasodilator ( at normal concentrations ) ; in the kidneys , it increases sodium excretion and urine output ; in the pancreas , it reduces insulin production ; in the digestive system , it reduces gastrointestinal motility and protects intestinal mucosa ; and in the immune system , it reduces the activity of lymphocytes .",

Dopamine receptors are implicated in many neurological processes , including motivation , pleasure , cognition , memory , learning , and fine motor control , as well as modulation of neuroendocrine signaling . Abnormal dopamine receptor signaling and dopaminergic nerve function is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders .

  "/wiki/Reward_system": "The reward system is a group of neural structures responsible for incentive salience ( i.e. , motivation and wanting , desire , or craving for a reward ) , associative learning ( primarily positive reinforcement and classical conditioning ) , and positively-valenced emotions , particularly ones which involve pleasure as a core component ( e.g. , joy , euphoria and ecstasy ) . Reward is the attractive and motivational property of a stimulus that induces appetitive behavior , also known as approach behavior , and consummatory behavior . In its description of a rewarding stimulus ( i.e. , a reward ) , a review on reward neuroscience noted , any stimulus , object , event , activity , or situation that has the potential to make us approach and consume it is by definition a reward . In operant conditioning , rewarding stimuli function as positive reinforcers ; however , the converse statement also holds true : positive reinforcers are rewarding . Primary rewards are a class of rewarding stimuli which facilitate the survival of one 's self and offspring , and include homeostatic ( e.g. , palatable food ) and reproductive ( e.g. , sexual contact and parental investment ) rewards . Intrinsic rewards are unconditioned rewards that are attractive and motivate behavior because they are inherently pleasurable . Extrinsic rewards ( e.g. , money or seeing one 's favorite sports team winning a game ) are conditioned rewards that are attractive and motivate behavior , but are not inherently pleasurable . Extrinsic rewards derive their motivational value as a result of a learned association ( i.e. , conditioning ) with intrinsic rewards . Extrinsic rewards may also elicit pleasure ( e.g. , euphoria from winning a lot of money in a lottery ) after being classically conditioned with intrinsic rewards . Survival for most animal species depends upon maximizing contact with beneficial stimuli and minimizing contact with harmful stimuli . Reward cognition serves to increase the likelihood of survival and reproduction by causing associative learning , eliciting approach and consummatory behavior , and triggering positively-valenced emotions . Thus , reward is a mechanism that evolved to help increase the adaptive fitness of animals .",

Second , AVP constricts arterioles , which increases peripheral vascular resistance and raises arterial blood pressure . A third function is possible . Some AVP may be released directly into the brain from the hypothalamus , and may play an important role in social behavior , sexual motivation and pair bonding , and maternal responses to stress .

This is useful in the treatment of hemophilia A as well as Von Willebrand disease .

Exocytosis is in process a large amount of molecules are released thus making it a form of bulk transport . In exocytosis , membrane-bound secretory vesicles are carried to the cell membrane , and their contents ( i.e. , water-soluble molecules ) are secreted into the extracellular environment . This secretion is possible because the vesicle transiently fuses with the plasma membrane . In the context of neurotransmission , neurotransmitters are typically released from synaptic vesicles into the synaptic cleft via exocytosis ; however , neurotransmitters can also be released via reverse transport through membrane transport proteins .

They are specialized smooth muscle cells mainly in the walls of the afferent arterioles , and some in the efferent arterioles , that deliver blood to the glomerulus . In synthesizing renin , they play a critical role in the renin-angiotensin system and thus in autoregulation of the kidney . Juxtaglomerular cells secrete renin in response to a drop in pressure detected by stretch receptors in the vascular walls , or when stimulated by macula densa cells . Macula densa cells are located in the distal convoluted tubule , and stimulate juxtaglomerular cells to release renin when they detect a drop in sodium concentration in tubular fluid . Together , juxtaglomerular cells , extraglomerular mesangial cells and macula densa cells comprise the juxtaglomerular apparatus . In appropriately stained tissue sections , juxtaglomerular cells are distinguished by their granulated cytoplasm . The juxtaglomerular cell is a cell that is located near the glomerulus , hence its name . Similar to cardiac tissue , juxtaglomerular cells harbor \u03b21 adrenergic receptors . When stimulated by epinephrine or norepinephrine , these receptors induce the secretion of renin . These cells also respond directly to a decrease in systemic blood pressure which is manifested as a lower renal perfusion pressure .",
  "/wiki/Adrenergic_agonists": "An adrenergic agonist is a drug that stimulates a response from the adrenergic receptors . The five main categories of adrenergic receptors are : \u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b21 , \u03b22 , and \u03b23 , although there are more subtypes , and agonists vary in specificity between these receptors , and may be classified respectively . However , there are also other mechanisms of adrenergic agonism . Epinephrine and norepinephrine are endogenous and broad-spectrum . More selective agonists are more useful in pharmacology . An adrenergic agent is a drug , or other substance , which has effects similar to , or the same as , epinephrine ( adrenaline ) . Thus , it is a kind of sympathomimetic agent . Alternatively , it may refer to something which is susceptible to epinephrine , or similar substances , such as a biological receptor ( specifically , the adrenergic receptors ) .",
  "/wiki/\u0392-receptor": "The adrenergic receptors or adrenoceptors are a class of G protein-coupled receptors that are targets of many catecholamines like norepinephrine ( noradrenaline ) and epinephrine ( adrenaline ) produced by the body , but also many medications like beta blockers , \u03b22 agonists and \u03b12 agonists , which are used to treat high blood pressure and asthma , for example . Many cells have these receptors , and the binding of a catecholamine to the receptor will generally stimulate the sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) . The SNS is responsible for the fight-or-flight response , which is triggered by experiences such as exercise or fear-causing situations . This response dilates pupils , increases heart rate , mobilizes energy , and diverts blood flow from non-essential organs to skeletal muscle . These effects together tend to increase physical performance momentarily .",
  "/wiki/Renin": "Renin ( etymology and pronunciation ) , also known as an angiotensinogenase , is an aspartic protease protein and enzyme secreted by the kidneys that participates in the body 's renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) - also known as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis - that mediates the volume of extracellular fluid ( blood plasma , lymph and interstitial fluid ) and arterial vasoconstriction . Thus , it regulates the body 's mean arterial blood pressure . Renin can also be referred to as a hormone , as it has a receptor , the ( pro ) renin receptor , also known as the renin receptor and prorenin receptor ( see also below ) , as well as enzymatic activity with which it hydrolyzes angiotensinogen to angiotensin I ."
