  "/wiki/Teleprinter": "A teleprinter ( teletypewriter , Teletype or TTY ) is an electromechanical device that can be used to send and receive typed messages through various communications channels , in both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint configurations . Initially they were used in telegraphy , which developed in the late 1830s and 1840s as the first use of electrical engineering . The machines were adapted to provide a user interface to early mainframe computers and minicomputers , sending typed data to the computer and printing the response . Some models could also be used to create punched tape for data storage ( either from typed input or from data received from a remote source ) and to read back such tape for local printing or transmission . Teleprinters could use a variety of different communication media . These included a simple pair of wires ; dedicated non-switched telephone circuits ( leased lines ) ; switched networks that operated similarly to the public telephone network ( telex ) ; and radio and microwave links ( telex-on-radio , or TOR ) . A teleprinter attached to a modem could also communicate through standard switched public telephone lines . This latter configuration was often used to connect teleprinters to remote computers , particularly in time-sharing environments . Teleprinters have largely been replaced by fully electronic computer terminals which typically have a computer monitor instead of a printer ( though the term TTY is still occasionally used to refer to them , such as in Unix systems ) . Teleprinters are still widely used in the aviation industry ( see AFTN and airline teletype system ) , and variations called Telecommunications Devices for the Deaf ( TDDs ) are used by the hearing impaired for typed communications over ordinary telephone lines .",

  "/wiki/Wilson_desk": "The Wilson desk is a large mahogany desk used by Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford in the Oval Office as their Oval Office desk . One of only six desks used by a President in the Oval office , it was purchased between 1897 and 1899 by Garret Augustus Hobart , the 24th Vice President of the United States , for the Vice President 's Room in the United States Capitol . Nixon chose this desk for the Oval Office because of his mistaken belief that former President Woodrow Wilson had used it there . In 1971 Nixon had five recording devices secretly installed in the Wilson desk by the United States Secret Service . These recordings constitute some of the Watergate tapes . Nixon referred to the desk in 1969 in his Silent majority speech , stating Fifty years ago , in this room and at this very desk , President Woodrow Wilson spoke words which caught the imagination of a war-weary world . In actuality , the desk was never used by Woodrow Wilson in the Oval office . Nixon was informed by one of his speech writers , William Safire , that the desk was actually used by Vice President of the United States Henry Wilson during President Ulysses S. Grant 's administration . This also appears to be untrue , since the desk was n't ordered until 1897 or later , more than 22 years after Henry Wilson 's death . The Wilson Desk appears to be a misnomer , as it has never been continuously used by anyone with the last name of Wilson .",

Although Rodin is generally considered the progenitor of modern sculpture , he did not set out to rebel against the past . He was schooled traditionally , took a craftsman-like approach to his work , and desired academic recognition , although he was never accepted into Paris 's foremost school of art . Rodin possessed a unique ability to model a complex , turbulent , deeply pocketed surface in clay . Many of his most notable sculptures were criticized during his lifetime . They clashed with predominant figurative sculpture traditions , in which works were decorative , formulaic , or highly thematic . Rodin 's most original work departed from traditional themes of mythology and allegory , modeled the human body with realism , and celebrated individual character and physicality . Rodin was sensitive to the controversy surrounding his work , but refused to change his style . Successive works brought increasing favor from the government and the artistic community . From the unexpected realism of his first major figure - inspired by his 1875 trip to Italy - to the unconventional memorials whose commissions he later sought , Rodin 's reputation grew , and he became the preeminent French sculptor of his time . By 1900 , he was a world-renowned artist .

  "/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation": "The Emancipation Proclamation , or Proclamation 95 , was a presidential proclamation and executive order issued by United States President Abraham Lincoln on September 2 , 1862 , and effective as of January 1 , 1863 . It changed the legal status under federal law of more than 3.5 million enslaved African Americans in the Confederate states from slave to free . As soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government , either by running away across Union lines or through the advance of federal troops , the slave was permanently free . Ultimately , the Union victory brought the proclamation into effect in all of the former Confederacy . The remaining slaves , those in the areas not in revolt , were freed by state action , or by the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , ratified in December 1865 . With Congress ' approval Lincoln in 1862 , with partial compensation , ended slavery in the District of Columbia ; this long-standing issue was now addressable since the Senators of the states in rebellion , who had blocked such a measure so as not to set a precedent , left Congress in 1861 . As for the states , Lincoln believed that he had no authority as President to end slavery , which was a state matter . However , Lincoln was not only President , he was Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces . As such , he could take military measures . His order carefully limited the Proclamation to those areas in insurrection , where civil government was not respected and his military authority , therefore , applied . As a war measure , it hurt the South economically by removing its labor force , helped the Union militarily by making Union soldiers out of freed slaves , and took an implicit statement toward black citizenship by accepting blacks as soldiers and trusting them with arms .
