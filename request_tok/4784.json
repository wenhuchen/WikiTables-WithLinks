They promote themselves as having a larger and more varied playlist than most other commercial radio stations . It is not unusual for a Jack FM station to have a playlist of 700 to 2000 songs , while other FM radio stations may have playlists of fewer than 500 songs .

  "/wiki/102.2_Jazz_FM": "102.2 Jazz FM ( also known as London Jazz Radio and JFM ) was a local jazz and soul music station for London run by GMG Radio . The station was based in and broadcast from Castlereagh Street in London . The station experimented with its core playlist over its fifteen-year history , incorporating smooth jazz , mainstream jazz , soul , jazz fusion , acid jazz , blues and rhythm and blues . In 1994 the station changed its name to JFM to encourage more listeners who were put off by the 'Jazz ' in the station 's name . Richard Wheatly was appointed in 1995 to turn the station around when there was only three months ' money left to run the station . Wheatly made a number of sweeping changes to the playlist , selling a sister station and changing the name back to Jazz FM , as well as starting up a record label and spin-off business deals and opportunities which helped Jazz FM swing into the black and make a profit in 2001 . In July 2002 , after a relaxation in ownership rules from the publication of the Communications Bill , the Guardian Media Group 's radio division was able to purchase the station for \u00a344.5 million . GMG made more changes to the playlist , shifting to more R & B , soul , easy listening and adult contemporary music during the daytime . In 2004 with the agreement of Ofcom , jazz was dropped from the daytime schedules but retained a requirement of 45 hours of jazz to be played during the night . In June 2005 , GMG Radio replaced the station with adult contemporary station 102.2 Smooth FM . GMG cited a number of reasons for replacing Jazz FM , including poor listening figures , not making money , the 'Jazz ' name putting off potential listeners as well as not enough jazz for jazz purists . The Jazz FM name was retained by GMG for the relaunched ejazz.fm website service which was renamed jazzfm.com on the same day as the launch of Smooth FM .",
