  "intro": "The 2007 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament was held from June 1 to 24, 2007. Sixty-four NCAA Division I college baseball teams advanced to the post season tournament after having played through a regular season, and for some, a conference tournament. The 2007 tournament culminated with 8 teams advancing to the College World Series at historic Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, Nebraska, on June 15. Unseeded Oregon State repeated as national champions, winning all five of its games in the 2007 CWS. Oregon State went undefeated through the College World Series, posting a 5-0 record. The Beavers, led by head coach Pat Casey, won all three games in their four-team bracket and then defeated North Carolina in two games in the best-of-three championship series. Oregon State became the fifth team to win consecutive NCAA titles (last done by LSU in 1996-97), and were the first team to win four games in a CWS by six or more runs. As of 2019, 2007 Oregon State remains the only team to have ever won at least four games by six or more runs in the same College World Series. Their opener against Cal State Fullerton was a tight 3-2 victory, but OSU's last four games in the CWS were not close, impressive for a team seeded in the lower half of the 64-team tournament. The Beavers also became the first team to win the CWS after having posted a losing conference record. Oregon State was a disappointing 10-14 (.417) in the Pac-10, placing sixth among the nine baseball-playing schools (Oregon dropped baseball in 1981, but revived it in 2009.) However, the Beavers' non-conference record during the regular season was an impressive 28-3 (.903), and as defending NCAA champions, just enough to gain a berth in the 64-team tournament."
