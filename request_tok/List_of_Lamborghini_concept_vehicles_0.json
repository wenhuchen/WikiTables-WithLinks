It was distinguished by amply glazed gull-wing doors and an equally amply louvered rear window . Propulsion was by a 2.0 L 175 bhp ( 130 kW ) inline-six engine , actually a split-in-half version of Lamborghini 's 4.0 L V12 , mated to a 5-speed transmission . The Marzal remained a one-off , though the general shape and many of the ideas would later be used in the Lamborghini Espada .

This layout has since become the standard for high-performance sports and supercars . When released , it was the fastest production road car . The Miura was originally conceived by Lamborghini 's engineering team , which designed the car in its spare time against the wishes of company founder Ferruccio Lamborghini , who preferred powerful yet sedate grand touring cars over the race car-derived machines produced by local rival Ferrari . The Miura 's rolling chassis was presented at the 1965 Turin Auto Show , and the prototype P400 debuted at the 1966 Geneva Motor Show .

It was never put into production , but many styling features were inspired by the Countach , including the angular features and the window arrangement , but the interior was never more than what was barely necessary to operate the vehicle . In 1987 it was considered for production as a companion car to the Bertone built Fiat X1/9 .

It was a followup to the LM001 and was first presented at the 1982 Geneva Auto Show . Finally seeing the problems with their initial designs ( the Cheetah , and the LM001 ) , Lamborghini decided to move the engine to the front . This required a redesign of the entire chassis .

The redesign used a tubular steel spaceframe and increased the overall weight by about 500 kg to 2,600 kg ( 5,732 lb ) . Moving the engine also freed up a large amount of space in the rear , which allowed for enough room to fit 6 more passengers , for a total of 11 occupants . The increased weight required a suspension redesign and the addition of power steering . A five-speed transmission with a hydraulic clutch was used . Also , for the first time the four-wheel-drive capabilities could be turned off , allowing the vehicle to become only rear-wheel drive when desired . The front differential provided a maximum lock of 25 percent , while the rear and center ones could lock up to 75 percent .

  "/wiki/Lamborghini_Marco_Polo": "The Lamborghini Marco Polo , or Italdesign Marco Polo , was a styling exercise by Italdesign Giugiaro . Introduced in 1982 at the Bologna Motor Show , the Marco Polo was inspired by the Lancia Medusa concept car designed by Italdesign two years prior . The design was originally intended for an upcoming DeLorean DMC-24 sedan , but DMC ran out of money before the concept was finished . Italdesign then recycled the design into a concept for Lamborghini . The wheels on the Marco Polo are standard DeLorean alloys covered by hubcaps . The Marco Polo is not a running prototype , rather the design is only a painted plastic model for aerodynamic research . The Lamborghini badge on the nose of the car was not to imply any design program undertaken with the factory but was a compliment paid by Giugiaro to the famous manufacturer that became noteworthy for pushing the limits of automotive design . Although Lamborghini has a more exciting image to its products , Giugiaro decided to give this study a less aggressive line , preferring instead to focus on aerodynamic efficiency in order to provide a quieter passenger compartment and higher speed while maintaining fuel consumption . As such , the Marco Polo features a Cx of 0.24 , compared to the Medusa 's 0.26 .

  "/wiki/Diesel_engine": "The diesel engine ( also known as a compression-ignition or CI engine ) , named after Rudolf Diesel , is an internal combustion engine in which ignition of the fuel is caused by the elevated temperature of the air in the cylinder due to the mechanical compression ( adiabatic compression ) . This contrasts with spark-ignition engines such as a petrol engine ( gasoline engine ) or gas engine ( using a gaseous fuel as opposed to petrol ) , which use a spark plug to ignite an air-fuel mixture . Diesel engines work by compressing only the air . This increases the air temperature inside the cylinder to such a high degree that atomised diesel fuel injected into the combustion chamber ignites spontaneously . With the fuel being injected into the air just before combustion , the dispersion of the fuel is uneven ; this is called a heterogeneous air-fuel mixture . The torque a diesel engine produces is controlled by manipulating the air-fuel ratio ( \u03bb ) ; instead of throttling the intake air , the diesel engine relies on altering the amount of fuel that is injected , and the air-fuel ratio is usually high . The diesel engine has the highest thermal efficiency ( engine efficiency ) of any practical internal or external combustion engine due to its very high expansion ratio and inherent lean burn which enables heat dissipation by the excess air . A small efficiency loss is also avoided compared with two-stroke non-direct-injection gasoline engines since unburned fuel is not present at valve overlap and therefore no fuel goes directly from the intake/injection to the exhaust . Low-speed diesel engines ( as used in ships and other applications where overall engine weight is relatively unimportant ) can reach effective efficiencies of up to 55% . Diesel engines may be designed as either two-stroke or four-stroke cycles . They were originally used as a more efficient replacement for stationary steam engines . Since the 1910s they have been used in submarines and ships .",

In 1998 , it was acquired by Daimler-Benz , and the holding company was renamed DaimlerChrysler . After Daimler divested Chrysler in 2007 , the company existed as Chrysler LLC ( 2007-2009 ) and Chrysler Group LLC ( 2009-2014 ) before merging in 2014 with Italian holding company Fiat S.p.A. and becoming a subsidiary of its successor Fiat Chrysler Automobiles . In addition to the Chrysler brand , FCA sells vehicles worldwide under the Dodge , Jeep , and Ram nameplates . Furthermore , the subsidiary includes Mopar , its automotive parts and accessories division , and SRT , its performance automobile division . After founding the company , Walter Chrysler used the General Motors brand diversification and hierarchy strategy that he had seen working for Buick , and acquired Fargo Trucks and Dodge Brothers , and created the Plymouth and DeSoto brands in 1928 . Facing postwar declines in market share , productivity , and profitability , as GM and Ford were growing , Chrysler borrowed $ 250 million in 1954 from Prudential Insurance to pay for expansion and updated car designs . Chrysler expanded into Europe by taking control of French , British and Spanish auto companies in the 1960s ; Chrysler Europe was sold in 1978 to PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn for $ 1 . The company struggled to adapt to changing markets , increased U.S. import competition , and safety and environmental regulation in the 1970s .

There was also some speculation that the engine block of the original 5.0-litre Lamborghini V10 was closely based on the Audi 4.2 FSI V8 , which Audi produces for its luxury cars . However , this was denied by Audi AG , in their official documentation for their 5.2 FSI V10 engine , as used in the Audi S6 and Audi S8 - the Lamborghini 5.0 V10 has a cylinder bore spacing of 88 millimetres ( 3.46 in ) between centres , whereas the Audi 5.2 V10 cylinder bore spacing is 90 millimetres ( 3.54 in ) , the same as the Audi 4.2 FSI V8 . The cylinder heads use the four valves per cylinder layout favoured by the Italian firm , rather than the five valve per cylinder variation formerly favoured by the German members of Volkswagen Group - including Audi and Volkswagen Passenger Cars . It was later confirmed that the new 5.2-litre Lamborghini V10 is mechanically identical to the Audi 5.2 V10 engine , as is evident by Lamborghini 's usage of Audi 's Fuel Stratified Injection , and 90 mm cylinder spacing .",
