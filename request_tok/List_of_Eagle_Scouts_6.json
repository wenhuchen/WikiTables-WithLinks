  "/wiki/Don_Garlits": "Donald Glenn Don Garlits ( born January 14 , 1932 , Tampa , Florida ) is an American race car driver and automotive engineer . He is considered the father of drag racing . He is known as Big Daddy to drag racing fans around the world . Always a pioneer in the field of drag racing , he perfected the rear-engine Top Fuel dragster , an innovation motivated by the loss of part of his foot in a dragster accident . This design was notably safer since it put most of the fuel processing and rotating parts of the dragster behind the driver . The driver was placed in front of nearly all the mechanical components , thus protecting the driver and allowing him to activate a variety of safety equipment in the event of catastrophic mechanical failure or a fire . Garlits was an early promoter of the full-body , fire-resistant Nomex driving suit , complete with socks , gloves , and balaclava . Garlits was the first drag racer to officially surpass the 170 , 180 , 200 , [ citation needed ] 240 , 250 , and 270 mile per hour marks in the quarter mile ; he was also the first to top 200 mph ( 320 km/h ) in the 1\u20448 mi ( 0.20 km ) . He has been inducted into several Halls of Fame and has won many awards during his career . In May 2014 at age 82 , Garlits set a 184 mph ( 296 km/h ) speed record in an EV dragster , a battery-powered electric vehicle that does not burn fuel .",

A top fuel dragster accelerates from a standstill to 100 mph ( 160 km/h ) in as little as 0.8 seconds ( less than one third the time required by a production Porsche 911 Turbo to reach 60 mph ( 100 km/h ) ) and can exceed 280 mph ( 450 km/h ) in just 660 feet ( 200 m ) . This subjects the driver to an average acceleration of about 4.0 g0 ( 39 m/s2 ) over the duration of the race and with a peak of over 5.6 g0 ( 55 m/s2 ) . Because of the speeds , this class exclusively races to only a 1,000 foot ( 305 m ) distance , and not the traditional 1,320 feet ( 400 m ) . The rule was changed in 2008 by the National Hot Rod Association following the fatal crash of Funny Car driver Scott Kalitta during a qualifying session at Old Bridge Township Raceway Park in Englishtown , New Jersey , USA . The shortening of the distance was used in the FIA at some tracks , and as of 2012 is now the standard Top Fuel distance by the FIA . The International Hot Rod Association , which now sanctions Top Fuel in Australia , dropped the distance in September 2017 after Santo Rapisarda , a car owner who often runs NHRA races in the United States , pushed for the change .

Moreover , the CIA is the only agency authorized by law to carry out and oversee covert action at the behest of the President . It exerts foreign political influence through its tactical divisions , such as the Special Activities Center . The CIA was also instrumental in establishing intelligence services in several U.S. allied countries , such as Germany 's BND .

This position corresponds to what is generally known as a defense minister in many other countries . The secretary of defense is appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate , and is by custom a member of the Cabinet and by law a member of the National Security Council .

The word Cooperstown is often used as shorthand ( or a metonym ) for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum , similar to Canton for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton , Ohio . The Hall of Fame was established in 1939 by Stephen Carlton Clark , an heir to the Singer Sewing Machine fortune . Clark sought to bring tourists to a city hurt by the Great Depression , which reduced the local tourist trade , and Prohibition , which devastated the local hops industry . Clark constructed the Hall of Fame 's building , and it was dedicated on June 12 , 1939 . ( His granddaughter , Jane Forbes Clark , is the current chairman of the Board of Directors . ) The erroneous claim that Civil War hero Abner Doubleday invented baseball in Cooperstown was instrumental in the early marketing of the Hall . An expanded library and research facility opened in 1994 . Dale Petroskey became the organization 's president in 1999 . In 2002 , the Hall launched Baseball As America , a traveling exhibit that toured ten American museums over six years .",

  "/wiki/Civil_rights_movement": "The civil rights movement ( also known as the American civil rights movement and other terms ) [ b ] in the United States was a decades-long struggle by African Americans to end legalized racial discrimination , disenfranchisement and racial segregation in the United States . The movement has its origins in the Reconstruction era during the late 19th century , although the movement achieved its largest legislative gains in the mid-1960s after years of direct actions and grassroots protests . The social movement 's major nonviolent resistance campaigns eventually secured new protections in federal law for the human rights of all Americans . After the American Civil War and the abolition of slavery in the 1860s , the Reconstruction Amendments to the United States Constitution granted emancipation and constitutional rights of citizenship to all African Americans , most of whom had recently been enslaved . For a period , African Americans voted and held political office , but they were increasingly deprived of civil rights , often under Jim Crow laws , and subjected to discrimination and sustained violence by whites in the South . Over the following century , various efforts were made by African Americans to secure their legal rights . In 1954 , the separate but equal policy which aided the enforcement of Jim Crow laws was weakened with the United States Supreme Court 's Brown v. Board of Education ruling and other subsequent rulings which followed . Between 1955 and 1968 , acts of nonviolent protest and civil disobedience produced crisis situations and productive dialogues between activists and government authorities . Federal , state , and local governments , businesses , and communities often had to respond immediately to these situations , which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans across the country . The lynching of Chicago teenager Emmett Till in Mississippi , and the outrage generated by seeing how he had been abused , when his mother decided to have an open-casket funeral , mobilized the African-American community nationwide . Forms of protest and/or civil disobedience included boycotts , such as the successful Montgomery bus boycott ( 1955-56 ) in Alabama ; sit-ins such as the Greensboro sit-ins ( 1960 ) in North Carolina and successful Nashville sit-ins in Tennessee ; marches , such as the 1963 Birmingham Children 's Crusade and 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches ( 1965 ) in Alabama ; and a wide range of other nonviolent activities . At the culmination of a legal strategy pursued by African Americans , the U.S. Supreme Court began , in 1954 under the leadership of Earl Warren , to find unconstitutional many of the laws that had allowed racial segregation and discrimination to be legal in the United States .",

Board of Education of Topeka , Kansas , 347 U.S. 483 , on May 17 , 1954 . Tied to the 14th Amendment , the decision declared all laws establishing segregated schools to be unconstitutional , and it called for the desegregation of all schools throughout the nation . After the decision , the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) attempted to register black students in previously all-white schools in cities throughout the South . In Little Rock , Arkansas , the school board agreed to comply with the high court 's ruling .
