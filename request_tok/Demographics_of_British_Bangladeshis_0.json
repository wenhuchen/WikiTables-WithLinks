It is an electoral ward of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets , though the wider area stretches across both Bethnal Green Ward and St Peter 's ward . Part of the area has been designated by the council as a conservation area which includes a number of important listed buildings . The area emerged from the hamlet which developed around the Green , much of which survives today as Bethnal Green Gardens , located on Canbridge Heath Road . The hamlet was part of the ancient parish of Stepney , but adopted its definition as a wider district when , following population increases caused by the expansion of London in the 18th century , it was split off from Stepney as the parish of Bethnal Green in 1743 . It became part of the metropolis in 1855 and the County of London in 1889 . The parish became the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green in 1900 . In 1965 it was abolished and became a district in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets . The economic history of Bethnal Green is characterised by a shift away from agricultural provision for the City of London to market gardening , weaving and light industry , which has now all but disappeared . The quality of the built environment had deteriorated by the turn of the 20th century and was radically altered by aerial bombardment in the Second World War and the subsequent social housing developments .

The area was built up rapidly in the 19th century , mainly to accommodate immigrant workers and displaced London poor , and developed a reputation for poverty , overcrowding , violence and political dissent . It was severely damaged during the Blitz , with over a third of housing totally destroyed ; and then , in the 1960s , slum clearance and development replaced most residential streets with tower blocks and modern housing estates .
