  "/wiki/Atwell_Peak": "Atwell Peak is a dramatic pyramid shaped volcanic peak located at the southern edge of Mount Garibaldi , British Columbia , Canada . Atwell Peak was formed during an initial period of volcanism 0.51-0.22 million years ago and was the source of many pyroclastic flows during Garibaldi 's development . Frequent landslides on its west face drops steeply into the Cheekye River . Atwell Peak is often mistakenly called Mount Garibaldi when viewed from Squamish , since the main peak is hidden . The peak is usually climbed during winter or early spring when the rock is frozen because it is very loose and rotten . Atwell Peak contains three ridges , the north , east , and south . The two most visible routes are the north and south ridges . Atwell Peak consists of three ridges , the north , east , and south . The east ridge connects with the north ridge about 100 horizontal metres north of the summit . All ridges , with the possible exception of the upper east ridge , are sharp and heavily corniced in winter and spring . The north ridge is the shortest climbing route . Several gullies on the southeast face offer moderate routes that eventually join one of the three ridges .",
  "/wiki/Garibaldi_Volcanic_Belt": "The Garibaldi Volcanic Belt is a northwest-southeast trending volcanic chain in the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains that extends from Watts Point in the south to the Ha-Iltzuk Icefield in the north . This chain of volcanoes is located in southwestern British Columbia , Canada . It forms the northernmost segment of the Cascade Volcanic Arc , which includes Mount St. Helens and Mount Baker . Most volcanoes of the Garibaldi chain are dormant stratovolcanoes and subglacial volcanoes that have been eroded by glacial ice . Less common volcanic landforms include cinder cones , volcanic plugs , lava domes and calderas . These diverse formations were created by different styles of volcanic activity , including Pel\u00e9an and Plinian eruptions . Eruptions along the length of the chain have created at least three major volcanic zones . The first began in the Powder Mountain Icefield 4.0 million years ago . The Mount Cayley massif began its formation during this period . Multiple eruptions from 2.2 million to 2,350 years ago created the Mount Meager massif , and eruptions 1.3 million to 9,300 years ago formed Mount Garibaldi and other volcanoes in the Garibaldi Lake area . These major volcanic zones lie in three echelon segments , referred to as the northern , central , and southern segments . Each segment contains one of the three major volcanic zones .",

The end of the Pleistocene corresponds with the end of the last glacial period and also with the end of the Paleolithic age used in archaeology . The Pleistocene is the first epoch of the Quaternary Period or sixth epoch of the Cenozoic Era . In the ICS timescale , the Pleistocene is divided into four stages or ages , the Gelasian , Calabrian , Chibanian , and Upper Pleistocene ( unofficially the Tarantian ) . [ note 1 ] In addition to these international subdivisions , various regional subdivisions are often used . Before a change finally confirmed in 2009 by the International Union of Geological Sciences , the time boundary between the Pleistocene and the preceding Pliocene was regarded as being at 1.806 million years Before Present ( BP ) , as opposed to the currently accepted 2.58 million years BP . Publications from the preceding years may use either definition of the period .",

  "/wiki/Northern_Cordilleran_Volcanic_Province": "The Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province ( NCVP ) , formerly known as the Stikine Volcanic Belt , is a geologic province defined by the occurrence of Miocene to Holocene volcanoes in the Pacific Northwest of North America . This belt of volcanoes extends roughly north-northwest from northwestern British Columbia and the Alaska Panhandle through Yukon to the Southeast Fairbanks Census Area of far eastern Alaska , in a corridor hundreds of kilometres wide . It is the most recently defined volcanic province in the Western Cordillera . It has formed due to extensional cracking of the North American continent - similar to other on-land extensional volcanic zones , including the Basin and Range Province and the East African Rift . Although taking its name from the Western Cordillera , this term is a geologic grouping rather than a geographic one . The southmost part of the NCVP has more , and larger , volcanoes than does the rest of the NCVP ; further north it is less clearly delineated , describing a large arch that sways westward through central Yukon . At least four large volcanoes are grouped with the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province , including Hoodoo Mountain in the Boundary Ranges , the Mount Edziza volcanic complex on the Tahltan Highland , and Level Mountain and Heart Peaks on the Nahlin Plateau . These four volcanoes have volumes of more than 15 km3 ( 3.6 cu mi ) , the largest and oldest which is Level Mountain with an area of 1,800 km2 ( 690 sq mi ) and a volume of more than 860 km3 ( 210 cu mi ) . Apart from the large volcanoes , several smaller volcanoes exist throughout the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province , including cinder cones which are widespread throughout the volcanic zone . Most of these small cones have been sites of only one volcanic eruption ; this is in contrast to the larger volcanoes throughout the volcanic zone , which have had more than one volcanic eruption throughout their history . The Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province is part of an area of intensive earthquake and volcanic activity around the Pacific Ocean called the Pacific Ring of Fire . However , the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province is commonly interpreted to be part of a gap in the Pacific Ring of Fire between the Cascade Volcanic Arc further south and the Aleutian Arc further north .",
  "/wiki/Miocene": "The Miocene ( /\u02c8ma\u026a.\u0259\u02ccsi\u02d0n , \u02c8ma\u026a.o\u028a-/ MY-\u0259-seen , MY-oh- ) is the first geological epoch of the Neogene Period and extends from about 23.03 to 5.333 million years ago ( Ma ) . The Miocene was named by Charles Lyell ; its name comes from the Greek words \u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd ( mei\u014dn , less ) and \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 ( kainos , new ) and means less recent because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene . The Miocene is preceded by the Oligocene and is followed by the Pliocene . As the earth went from the Oligocene through the Miocene and into the Pliocene , the climate slowly cooled towards a series of ice ages . The Miocene boundaries are not marked by a single distinct global event but consist rather of regionally defined boundaries between the warmer Oligocene and the cooler Pliocene Epoch . The apes first evolved , arose , and diversified during the early Miocene ( Aquitanian and Burdigalian stages ) , becoming widespread in the Old World . By the end of this epoch and the start of the following one , the ancestors of humans had split away from the ancestors of the chimpanzees to follow their own evolutionary path during the final Messinian stage ( 7.5-5.3 Ma ) of the Miocene . As in the Oligocene before it , grasslands continued to expand and forests to dwindle in extent . In the seas of the Miocene , kelp forests made their first appearance and soon became one of Earth 's most productive ecosystems . The plants and animals of the Miocene were recognizably modern . Mammals and birds were well-established . Whales , pinnipeds , and kelp spread .",

In a general sense , it is the intermediate type between basalt and rhyolite , and ranges from 57 to 63% silicon dioxide ( SiO2 ) as illustrated in TAS diagrams . The mineral assemblage is typically dominated by plagioclase plus pyroxene or hornblende . Magnetite , zircon , apatite , ilmenite , biotite , and garnet are common accessory minerals . Alkali feldspar may be present in minor amounts . The quartz-feldspar abundances in andesite and other volcanic rocks are illustrated in QAPF diagrams . Classification of andesites may be refined according to the most abundant phenocryst . Example : hornblende-phyric andesite , if hornblende is the principal accessory mineral . Andesite can be considered as the extrusive equivalent of plutonic diorite . Characteristic of subduction zones , andesite represents the dominant rock type in island arcs . The average composition of the continental crust is andesitic . Along with basalts they are a major component of the Martian crust .",

It began approximately 11,650 cal years before present , after the last glacial period , which concluded with the Holocene glacial retreat . The Holocene and the preceding Pleistocene together form the Quaternary period . The Holocene has been identified with the current warm period , known as MIS 1 . It is considered by some to be an interglacial period within the Pleistocene Epoch , called the Flandrian interglacial . The Holocene corresponds with rapid proliferation , growth and impacts of the human species worldwide , including all of its written history , technological revolutions , development of major civilizations , and overall significant transition towards urban living in the present . Human impacts on modern-era Earth and its ecosystems may be considered of global significance for future evolution of living species , including approximately synchronous lithospheric evidence , or more recently hydrospheric and atmospheric evidence of human impacts . In July 2018 , the International Union of Geological Sciences split the Holocene epoch into three distinct subsections , Greenlandian ( 11,700 years ago to 8,326 years ago ) , Northgrippian ( 8,326 years ago to 4,200 years ago ) and Meghalayan ( 4,200 years ago to the present ) , as proposed by International Commission on Stratigraphy .

Part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc of western North America , it is located 150 km ( 93 mi ) north of Vancouver at the northern end of the Pemberton Valley and reaches a maximum elevation of 2,680 m ( 8,790 ft ) . The massif is capped by several eroded volcanic edifices , including lava domes , volcanic plugs and overlapping piles of lava flows ; these form at least six major summits including Mount Meager which is the second highest of the massif . The Garibaldi Volcanic Belt ( GVB ) has a long history of eruptions and poses a threat to the surrounding region . Any volcanic hazard ranging from landslides to eruptions could pose a significant risk to humans and wildlife . Although the massif has not erupted for more than 2,000 years , it could produce a major eruption ; if this were to happen , relief efforts would be quickly organized . Teams such as the Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan ( IVENP ) are prepared to notify people threatened by volcanic eruptions in Canada . The Mount Meager massif produced the largest volcanic eruption in Canada in the last 10,000 years . About 2,400 years ago , an explosive eruption formed a volcanic crater on its northeastern flank and sent avalanches of hot ash , rock fragments and volcanic gases down the northern flank of the volcano . Evidence for more recent volcanic activity has been documented at the volcano , such as hot springs and earthquakes . The Mount Meager massif has also been the source of several large landslides in the past , including a massive debris flow in 2010 that swept down Meager Creek and the Lillooet River .",
