  "/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland .",

  "/wiki/U.S._Route_12_in_Michigan": "US Highway 12 ( US 12 ) is an east-west US Highway that runs from Aberdeen , Washington , to Detroit , Michigan . In Michigan it runs for 210 miles ( 338 km ) between New Buffalo and Detroit as a state trunkline highway and Pure Michigan Byway . On its western end , the highway is mostly a two-lane road that runs through the southern tier of counties roughly parallel to the Indiana state line . It forms part of the Niles Bypass , a four-lane expressway south of Niles in the southwestern part of the state , and it runs concurrently with the Interstate 94 ( I-94 ) freeway around the south side of Ypsilanti in the southeastern . In between Coldwater and the Ann Arbor area , the highway angles northeasterly and passes the Michigan International Speedway . East of Ypsilanti , US 12 follows a divided highway routing on Michigan Avenue into Detroit , where it terminates at an intersection with Cass Avenue . When US 12 was designated in Michigan on November 11 , 1926 , along with the other original US Highways , it ran along a more northerly course . It originally replaced sections of the original M-11 and M-17 along Michigan Avenue in the state , the route of the much older St. Joseph Trail , a footpath used by Native Americans before European settlement in the area . It entered from Indiana as it does now , but it followed the Lake Michigan shoreline farther north to Benton Harbor-St. Joseph before turning eastward to run through Kalamazoo , Battle Creek and Jackson . In the Ann Arbor area , it followed a more northerly path into Detroit before terminating downtown . In the 1940s and 1950s , sections of the highway were converted into expressways and freeways .

  "/wiki/Faux_bois": "Faux bois ( from the French for false wood ) refers to the artistic imitation of wood or wood grains in various media . The craft has roots in the Renaissance with trompe-l'\u0153il . It was probably first crafted with concrete using an iron armature by garden craftsmen in France called rocailleurs using common iron materials : rods , barrel bands , and chicken wire . Early examples of the craft survive at Parc des Buttes-Chaumont opened for an exposition in Paris in 1867 . In 1873 , the inventor of ferrocement , Joseph Monier expanded his patents to include bridges . He designed the first bridge of reinforced concrete , crossing the moat at the Chateau Chazelet , in France . It was sculpted to resemble timbers and logs . Ferrocement faux bois uses a combination of concrete , mortar and grout applied to a steel frame or armature to sculpt lifelike representations of wooden objects . Final sculpting can be done while the mixture is wet , in a putty state , or slightly stiff . Techniques vary among artisans . Most popular in the late 19th century through the 1940s , ferrocement faux bois has largely disappeared with the passing of those most expert in its practice .

  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",

[ b ] Other responsibilities that fall under MDOT 's mandate include airports , shipping and rail in Michigan . The predecessor to today 's MDOT was the Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) that was formed on July 1 , 1905 after a constitutional amendment was approved that year . The first activities of the department were to distribute rewards payments to local units of government for road construction and maintenance . In 1913 , the state legislature authorized the creation of the state trunkline highway system , and the MSHD paid double rewards for those roads . These trunklines were signed in 1919 , making Michigan the second state to post numbers on its highways . The department continued to improve roadways under its control through the Great Depression and into World War II . During the war , the state built its first freeways . These freeways became the start of Michigan 's section of the Interstate Highway System . Since the mid-1960s , the department was reorganized . It was renamed the Michigan Department of State Highways for a time .",
  "/wiki/Barrel_vault": "A barrel vault , also known as a tunnel vault or a wagon vault , is an architectural element formed by the extrusion of a single curve ( or pair of curves , in the case of a pointed barrel vault ) along a given distance . The curves are typically circular in shape , lending a semi-cylindrical appearance to the total design . The barrel vault is the simplest form of a vault : effectively a series of arches placed side by side ( i.e. , one after another ) . It is a form of barrel roof . As with all arch-based constructions , there is an outward thrust generated against the walls underneath a barrel vault . There are several mechanisms for absorbing this thrust . One is to make the walls exceedingly thick and strong - this is a primitive and sometimes unacceptable method . A more elegant method is to build two or more vaults parallel to each other ; the forces of their outward thrusts will thus negate each other . This method was most often used in construction of churches , where several vaulted naves ran parallel down the length of the building . However , the outer walls of the outermost vault would still have to be quite strong or reinforced by buttressing . The third and most elegant mechanism to resist the lateral thrust was to create an intersection of two barrel vaults at right angles , thus forming a groin vault . Barrel vaults are known from Ancient Egypt , and were used extensively in Roman architecture .",
  "/wiki/Deck_arch_bridge": "An arch bridge is a bridge with abutments at each end shaped as a curved arch . Arch bridges work by transferring the weight of the bridge and its loads partially into a horizontal thrust restrained by the abutments at either side . A viaduct ( a long bridge ) may be made from a series of arches , although other more economical structures are typically used today .",
  "/wiki/Parapet": "A parapet is a barrier which is an extension of the wall at the edge of a roof , terrace , balcony , walkway or other structure . The word comes ultimately from the Italian parapetto ( parare to cover/defend and petto breast ) . The German equivalent Br\u00fcstung has the same meaning . Where extending above a roof , a parapet may simply be the portion of an exterior wall that continues above the edge line of the roof surface , or may be a continuation of a vertical feature beneath the roof such as a fire wall or party wall . Parapets were originally used to defend buildings from military attack , but today they are primarily used as guard rails and to prevent the spread of fires . In the Bible the Hebrews are obligated to build a parapet on the roof of their houses to prevent people falling ."
