  "/wiki/Setsuwa": "Setsuwa ( Chinese : \u8aaa\u8a71 ; pinyin : shu\u014d hu\u00e0 , Japanese : \u8aac\u8a71 , romanized : setsu wa ) is an East Asian literary genre . It consists of myths , legends , folktales , and anecdotes . Setsuwa means spoken story . As one of the vaguest forms of literature , setsuwa is believed to have been passed down or presented in the form of narrations . Setsuwa are based foremost on oral tradition and existed primarily as folktales or in other non-written forms before being recorded and committed to text . However , some writers question whether all setsuwa tales were originally oral tradition , or only mostly so . Although there are no formal rules regarding what constitutes setsuwa as a genre , stories in the setsuwa style have in common brevity ; an uncomplicated plot unfolded in plain , direct language ; character delineation through dialogue and action rather than through description and psychological analysis ; and a predilection for amusing , starting , dramatic , or marvelous subject matter . [ attribution needed ] Setsuwa vary quite considerably in topic , but can be divided into two main groups : general and Buddhist . Buddhist setsuwa often contain themes of karmic retribution or miracles , while the content of general setsuwa is largely either secular in nature or focused on traditional Japanese religion and spirituality such as Shintoism . Many setsuwa collections were compiled during the Heian and Kamakura periods ( 8th-12th centuries , 12th-14th centuries ) . These collections were often assembled by Buddhist monks , but the authorship of many such works is still unknown or heavily debated . Setsuwa may be found integrated in other literature or in setsuwa collections .",

  "/wiki/The_Tale_of_Genji": "The Tale of Genji ( \u6e90\u6c0f\u7269\u8a9e , Genji monogatari , pronounced [ \u0261e\u0272d\u0291i mono\u0261a\ua71cta\u027ei ] ) is a classic work of Japanese literature written by the noblewoman and lady-in-waiting Murasaki Shikibu in the early years of the 11th century . The original manuscript no longer exists . It was made in concertina or orihon style : several sheets of paper pasted together and folded alternately in one direction then the other , around the peak of the Heian period . The work is a unique depiction of the lifestyles of high courtiers during the Heian period , written in archaic language and a poetic and confusing style that make it unreadable to the average Japanese person without dedicated study . It was not until the early 20th century that Genji was translated into modern Japanese , by the poet Akiko Yosano . The first English translation was attempted in 1882 , but was of poor quality and incomplete . The work recounts the life of Hikaru Genji , or Shining Genji , the son of an ancient Japanese emperor , known to readers as Emperor Kiritsubo , and a low-ranking concubine called Kiritsubo Consort . For political reasons , the emperor removes Genji from the line of succession , demoting him to a commoner by giving him the surname Minamoto , and he pursues a career as an imperial officer . The tale concentrates on Genji 's romantic life and describes the customs of the aristocratic society of the time . It is sometimes called the world 's first novel , the first modern novel , the first psychological novel or the first novel still to be considered a classic . While regarded as a masterpiece , its precise classification and influence in both the East Asian and Western canons has been a matter of debate ."
