His films are characterised by nonlinear narratives , atmospheric music , and vivid cinematography involving bold , saturated colours . A pivotal figure of Hong Kong cinema , Wong has a considerable influence on filmmaking with his trademark personal , unconventional approach , and his films frequently appear on best-of lists domestically and internationally . Born in Shanghai in 1958 , Wong moved to Hong Kong with his family when he was five . He began a career as a screenwriter for soap operas before transitioning to directing with his debut , the crime drama As Tears Go By ( 1988 ) . While As Tears Go By was fairly successful in Hong Kong , Wong moved away from the contemporary trend of crime and action movies to embark on more personal filmmaking styles . Days of Being Wild ( 1990 ) , his first venture into such direction , did not perform well at the box office . It however received critical acclaim , and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1991 Hong Kong Film Awards . His next film , Ashes of Time ( 1994 ) , was met with mixed reception because of its vague plot and atypical take on the wuxia genre . The production of Ashes of Time was time-consuming and left Wong exhausted ; he subsequently directed Chungking Express ( 1994 ) with hopes of reconciling with filmmaking . [ note 1 ] The film , expressing a more lighthearted atmosphere , catapulted Wong to international prominence , and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1995 Hong Kong Film Awards .
