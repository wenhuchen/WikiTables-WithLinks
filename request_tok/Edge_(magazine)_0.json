Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) .

The game is also the second Bayonetta product to receive Japanese voiceovers , using the same cast that voiced the Bayonetta : Bloody Fate anime film by Gonzo .

Players control a customizable protagonist and the gameplay is focused on weapons-based combat and exploration . Players battle varied enemies , including bosses , while using items such as swords and firearms as they journey through the story , exploring the game 's different locations , interacting with non-player characters , collecting key items involved in the story , and discovering and unraveling the world 's many mysteries . Bloodborne began development in 2012 under the working title of Project Beast . Bearing many similarities to the Souls series of games by the same developer and director , Bloodborne was partially inspired by the literary works of authors H. P. Lovecraft and Bram Stoker , and the architectural design of certain real world locations in places such as Romania and the Czech Republic . The decision by game director Hidetaka Miyazaki to create a new intellectual property ( IP ) and not another Souls game was made because he wanted to create something different ; at the same time , Sony wanted a new IP to be made exclusively for the PlayStation 4 . Bloodborne received critical acclaim , with praise being directed at its gameplay , particularly its high level of difficulty , sound design , atmospheric environments , interconnected world design , and plot .
