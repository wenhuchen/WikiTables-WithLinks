Connecticut 's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small , short-lived settlement called Fort Hoop in Hartford at the confluence of the Park and Connecticut Rivers . Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony New Netherland , which included much of the land between the Connecticut and Delaware Rivers , although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English . Thomas Hooker led a band of followers from the Massachusetts Bay Colony and founded the Connecticut Colony ; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the Saybrook Colony and the New Haven Colony . The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of Fundamental Orders , considered the first constitutions in America . In 1662 , the three colonies were merged under a royal charter , making Connecticut a crown colony .",

It is one of the six founding leagues of the Champions Hockey League and currently allocated five spots - the maximum number - based on success in previous editions . It was created in 1975 to replace the SM-sarja , which was fundamentally an amateur league . The SM-liiga is not directly overseen by the Finnish Ice Hockey Association , but the league and association have an agreement of cooperation . SM is a common abbreviation for Suomen mestaruus , Finnish championship . The SM-liiga formerly had a system of automatic promotion and relegation in place between itself and the Mestis , the second highest level of competition in Finland , but the automatic system was ended in 2000 . The league was opened in 2005 and allowed KalPa to get a promotion . In 2009 , a new system was introduced and it includes the last placed SM-liiga team facing the Mestis champion in a best of seven playout series . In 2013 , the relegation system was abandoned again and replaced by a procedure in which successful clubs of Mestis may apply for a promotion if they fulfill definite financial criteria . Since 2013 , Jokerit joined the KHL and Espoo Blues went bankrupt , but Sport , KooKoo and Jukurit were promoted . Therefore Liiga is a competition of 15 teams in the 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons .",
