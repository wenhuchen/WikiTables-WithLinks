Being centrally located in close proximity to the thirty-mile zone and having access to the media content of its parent companies drew Virgin Interactive 's U.S. division closer to Hollywood as it began developing sophisticated interactive games , leading to partnerships with Disney and other major studios on motion picture-based games such as The Lion King , Aladdin , RoboCop and The Terminator , in addition to being the publisher of popular titles from other companies like Capcom 's Resident Evil series and Street Fighter Collection and id Software 's Doom II in the European market .
