  "/wiki/Ellis_Island": "Ellis Island is a federally owned island in New York Harbor that contains a museum and former immigration inspection station . As the United States ' busiest immigrant inspection station from 1892 to 1954 , it processed approximately 12 million immigrants to the country through the Port of New York and New Jersey . Today , it is part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument , accessible to the public only by ferry . The north side of the island hosts the museum of immigration while the south side , including the Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital , is only open to the public through guided tours . In the 19th century , Ellis Island was the site of Fort Gibson , a component of the fortifications of New York Harbor . It later became a naval magazine for storing artillery . The first inspection station opened in 1892 and was destroyed by fire in 1897 . The second station opened in 1900 and housed facilities for medical quarantines as well as processing immigrants . After 1924 , Ellis Island was used primarily as a detention center . During both World War I and World War II its facilities were also used by the United States military to detain prisoners of war . Following the immigration station 's closure , the buildings languished for several years until they partially reopened in 1976 .

  "/wiki/Battery_Park": "The Battery , formerly known as Battery Park , is a 25-acre ( 10 ha ) public park located at the southern tip of Manhattan Island in New York City facing New York Harbor . It is bounded by Battery Place on the north , State Street on the east , New York Harbor to the south , and the Hudson River to the west . The park contains attractions such as an old fort named Castle Clinton ; multiple monuments ; and the SeaGlass Carousel . The surrounding area , known as South Ferry , contains multiple ferry terminals , including the Staten Island Ferry 's Whitehall Terminal as well as boat launches to the Statue of Liberty National Monument . The park and surrounding area is named for the artillery batteries that were built in the late 17th century to protect the settlement behind them . By the 1820s , the Battery had become an entertainment destination , with the conversion of Castle Clinton into a theater venue . During the mid-19th century , the modern-day Battery Park was constructed and Castle Clinton was converted into an immigration and customs center . The Battery was commonly known as the landing point for immigrants to New York City until 1890 , when the Castle Clinton immigration center was replaced by one on Ellis Island . Castle Clinton then hosted the New York Aquarium from 1896 to 1941 . In 1940 , the entirety of Battery Park was closed for twelve years due to the construction of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel and the Battery Park Underpass . The park reopened in 1952 after a renovation , but then subsequently went into decline . The Battery Conservancy , founded in 1994 by Warrie Price , underwrote and funded the restoration and improvement of the once-dilapidated park .",

Manhattan serves as the city 's economic and administrative center , cultural identifier , and historical birthplace . The borough consists mostly of Manhattan Island , bounded by the Hudson , East , and Harlem rivers ; as well as several small adjacent islands . Manhattan additionally contains Marble Hill , a small neighborhood now on the U.S. mainland , that was connected using landfill to the Bronx and separated from the rest of Manhattan by the Harlem River . Manhattan Island is divided into three informally bounded components , each aligned with the borough 's long axis : Lower , Midtown , and Upper Manhattan .

Manhattan traces its origins to a trading post founded by colonists from the Dutch Republic in 1624 on Lower Manhattan ; the post was named New Amsterdam in 1626 . Manhattan is historically documented to have been purchased by Dutch colonists from Native Americans in 1626 for 60 guilders , which equals roughly $ 1059 in current terms .

Additional people have died of 9/11-related cancer and respiratory diseases in the months and years following the attacks . Four passenger airliners operated by two major U.S. passenger air carriers ( United Airlines and American Airlines ) - all of which departed from airports in the northeastern United States bound for San Francisco and Los Angeles - were hijacked by 19 al-Qaeda terrorists . Two of the planes , American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 , were crashed into the North and South towers , respectively , of the World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan . Within an hour and 42 minutes , both 110-story towers collapsed . Debris and the resulting fires caused a partial or complete collapse of all other buildings in the World Trade Center complex , including the 47-story 7 World Trade Center tower , as well as significant damage to ten other large surrounding structures . A third plane , American Airlines Flight 77 , was crashed into the Pentagon ( the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense ) in Arlington County , Virginia , which led to a partial collapse of the building 's west side . The fourth plane , United Airlines Flight 93 , was initially flown toward Washington , D.C. , but crashed into a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville , Pennsylvania , after its passengers thwarted the hijackers . 9/11 is the single deadliest terrorist attack in human history and the single deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers in the history of the United States , with 343 and 72 killed , respectively .
