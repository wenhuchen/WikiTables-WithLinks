Narasimha iconography shows him with a human torso and lower body , with a lion face and claws , typically with a demon Hiranyakashipu in his lap whom he is in the process of killing . The demon is powerful brother of evil Hiranyaksha who had been previously killed by Vishnu , who hated Vishnu for killing his brother . Hiranyakashipu gains special powers by which he could not be killed during the day or night , inside or outside , by any weapon , and by man or animal . Endowed with new powers , Hiranyakashipu creates chaos , persecutes all devotees of Vishnu including his own son . Vishnu understands the demon 's power , then creatively adapts into a mixed avatar that is neither man nor animal and kills the demon at the junction of day and night , inside and outside . Narasimha is known primarily as the 'Great Protector ' who specifically defends and protects his devotees from evil . The most popular Narasimha mythology is the legend that protects his devotee Prahlada , and creatively destroys Prahlada 's demonic father and tyrant Hiranyakashipu . Narasimha legends are revered in Vaikhanasas , Sri Vaishnavism , Madhwa Brahmins but he is a popular deity beyond these Vaishnava traditions such as in Shaivism .
