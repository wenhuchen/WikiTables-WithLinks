  "/wiki/Gross_register_tonnage": "Gross register tonnage ( GRT , grt , g.r.t. , gt ) or gross registered tonnage , is a ship 's total internal volume expressed in register tons , each of which is equal to 100 cubic feet ( 2.83 m3 ) . Gross register tonnage uses the total permanently enclosed capacity of the vessel as its basis for volume . Typically this is used for dockage fees , canal transit fees , and similar purposes where it is appropriate to charge based on the size of the entire vessel . Net register tonnage subtracts the volume of spaces not available for carrying cargo , such as engine rooms , fuel tanks and crew quarters , from gross register tonnage . Gross register tonnage is not a measure of the ship 's weight or displacement and should not be confused with terms such as deadweight tonnage or displacement .",
  "/wiki/Displacement_(ship)": "The displacement or displacement tonnage of a ship is its weight based on the amount of water its hull displaces at varying loads . It is measured indirectly using Archimedes ' principle by first calculating the volume of water displaced by the ship then converting that value into weight displaced . Traditionally , various measurement rules have been in use , giving various measures in long tons . Today , metric tonnes are more used . Ship displacement varies by a vessel 's degree of load , from its empty weight as designed ( known as Lightweight tonnage ) to its maximum load . Numerous specific terms are used to describe varying levels of load and trim , detailed below . Ship displacement should not be confused with measurements of volume or capacity typically used for commercial vessels , such as net tonnage , gross tonnage , or deadweight tonnage .",
  "/wiki/Cargo_ship": "A cargo ship or freighter is a merchant ship that carries cargo , goods , and materials from one port to another . Thousands of cargo carriers ply the world 's seas and oceans each year , handling the bulk of international trade . Cargo ships are usually specially designed for the task , often being equipped with cranes and other mechanisms to load and unload , and come in all sizes . Today , they are almost always built by welded steel , and with some exceptions generally have a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years before being scrapped . [ better source needed ]",
  "/wiki/Auxiliary_cruiser": "An armed merchantman is a merchant ship equipped with guns , usually for defensive purposes , either by design or after the fact . In the days of sail , piracy and privateers , many merchantmen would be routinely armed , especially those engaging in long distance and high value trade . In more modern times , auxiliary cruisers were used offensively as merchant raiders to disrupt trade chiefly during both World War I and World War II , particularly by Germany . While armed merchantmen are clearly inferior to regular warships , sometimes they have scored successes in combat against them . Examples include East Indiamen mimicking ships of the line and chasing off regular French warships in the Battle of Pulo Aura in 1804 , and the German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran sinking the Australian light cruiser HMAS Sydney in their battle in 1941 , although Kormoran was also destroyed and had to be scuttled .",
  "/wiki/HMS_Bicester_(L34)": "HMS Bicester ( pennant number L34 ) was an escort destroyer of the Type II Hunt class . The Royal Navy ordered Bicester 's construction three months after the outbreak of the Second World War . Hawthorn Leslie & Co. laid down her keel at their Tyne yard on 29 May 1940 , as Admiralty Job Number J4210 . The ship was named after a fox hunt in Oxfordshire .",
  "/wiki/Hunt-class_destroyer": "The Hunt class was a class of escort destroyer of the Royal Navy . The first vessels were ordered early in 1939 , and the class saw extensive service in the Second World War , particularly on the British east coast and Mediterranean convoys . They were named after British fox hunts . The modern Hunt-class GRP hulled mine countermeasure vessels maintain the Hunt names lineage in the Royal Navy .",
  "/wiki/Destroyer": "In naval terminology , a destroyer is a fast , maneuverable , long-endurance warship intended to escort larger vessels in a fleet , convoy or battle group and defend them against powerful short range attackers . They were originally developed in the late 19th century by Fernando Villaamil for the Spanish Navy as a defense against torpedo boats , and by the time of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 , these torpedo boat destroyers ( TBDs ) were large , swift , and powerfully armed torpedo boats designed to destroy other torpedo boats . Although the term destroyer had been used interchangeably with TBD and torpedo boat destroyer by navies since 1892 , the term torpedo boat destroyer had been generally shortened to simply destroyer by nearly all navies by the First World War . Before World War II , destroyers were light vessels with little endurance for unattended ocean operations ; typically a number of destroyers and a single destroyer tender operated together . After the war , the advent of the guided missile allowed destroyers to take on the surface combatant roles previously filled by battleships and cruisers . This resulted in larger and more powerful guided missile destroyers more capable of independent operation . At the start of the 21st century , destroyers are the global standard for surface combatant ships , with only two nations ( United States and Russia ) operating the heavier class cruisers , with no battleships or true battlecruisers remaining . Modern guided missile destroyers are equivalent in tonnage but vastly superior in firepower to cruisers of the World War II era , and are capable of carrying nuclear-tipped cruise missiles . At 510 feet ( 160 m ) long , a displacement of 9,200 tons , and with armament of more than 90 missiles , guided missile destroyers such as the Arleigh Burke-class are actually larger and more heavily armed than most previous ships classified as guided missile cruisers . Some European navies , such as the French , Spanish , Dutch or German , use the term frigate for their destroyers , which leads to some confusion . After the Second World War , destroyers grew in size . The Allen M. Sumner-class destroyer had a displacement of 2200 tons , while the Arleigh Burke class has a displacement of up to 9600 tons , thus growing in size almost 340% .",
  "/wiki/Total_loss": "In insurance claims , a total loss or write-off is a situation where the lost value , repair cost or salvage cost of a damaged property exceeds its insured value . Such a loss may be an actual total loss or a constructive total loss . Constructive total loss considers further incidental expenses beyond repair , such as force majeure .",
  "/wiki/Coastal_trading_vessel": "Coastal trading vessels , also known as coasters , are shallow-hulled ships used for trade between locations on the same island or continent . Their shallow hulls mean that they can get through reefs where deeper-hulled seagoing ships usually can not . Coasters can load and unload cargo in shallow ports .",
  "/wiki/SS_Fort_Athabasca": "SS Fort Athabaska was a Canadian-owned Fort ship , sunk while under British naval use in 1943 . With the heavy demand for British cargo ships it was given to British naval forces . She was a North Sands type Fort ship built by Burrard Dry Dock of North Vancouver , and completed 15 May 1943 . On 2 December 1943 multiple squadrons of German bombers conducted a destructive air assault on Bari Harbour in Italy . Twenty-eight Allied ships were sunk in the raid with contents of mustard gas in one of their hulls . The moment the gas spread , the harbour became a poisonous inferno . One of the ships sunk in the raid was Fort Athabaska . The contents of the ship whilst it was stationed at Bari is unknown , but some records suggest medical/oil/ammunition supplies . The fate of the ship was sealed when multiple bombs penetrated the decks of the ship , leaving holes in the hull that could not be repaired . The order to abandon ship was given and the ship quickly submerged . Fort and Park ship were the Canadian equivalent of the American Liberty ships . All three shared a similar design by J.L .",
  "/wiki/Fort_ship": "The Fort ships were a class of 198 cargo ships built in Canada during World War II for use by the United Kingdom under the Lend-Lease scheme . They all had names prefixed with Fort when built . The ships were in service between 1942 and 1985 , with two still listed on shipping registers until 1992 . A total of 53 were lost during the war due to accidents or enemy action . One of these , Fort Stikine , was destroyed in 1944 by the detonation of 1,400 tons of explosive on board her . This event , known as the Bombay Explosion , killed over 800 people and sank thirteen ships . Forts ships were ships transferred to the British Government and the Park ships were those employed by the Canadian Government , both had the similar design .",
  "/wiki/Schooner": "A schooner is a type of sailing ship , as defined by its rig configuration . Typically it has two or more masts , the foremast being slightly shorter than the mainmast . Pronounced /\u02c8sku\u02d0n\u0259r/ , the term first appeared in eastern North America in the early 1700s . The name may be related to a Scots language word meaning to skip over water , or to skip stones .",
  "/wiki/SS_John_Bascom": "SS John Bascom was a Liberty ship built in the United States during World War II . She was named after John Bascom , a professor of rhetoric at Williams College from 1855 to 1874 , and the president of the University of Wisconsin from 1874 to 1887 ."
