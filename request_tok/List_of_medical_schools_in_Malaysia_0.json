With a highly strategic state position for international trade routes , Malacca was once a well-known international trade center in the East . Many traders anchored in Malacca , especially traders from Arabia , China and India , traded at the port of Malacca and from there were born many of the descendants and tribes that exist in Malacca to this day . The harmonious life and ambience of the people of Malacca is attributed to the life of various races and ethnicities that have long existed among the local community . Malays , Malaysian Chinese , Malaysian Indians , Baba Nyonya , Kristang , Chitty and Eurasians are important ethnic groups living in the State of Malacca up to the present day .",
