For most of its currently ( 2018 ) navigable 35-mile ( 56 km ) length it runs through the Brecon Beacons National Park , and its present rural character and tranquillity belies its original purpose as an industrial corridor for coal and iron , which were brought to the canal by a network of tramways and/or railroads , many of which were built and owned by the canal company . The Mon and Brec was originally two independent canals - the Monmouthshire Canal from Newport to Pontymoile Basin ( including the Crumlin Arm ) and the Brecknock and Abergavenny Canal running from Pontymoile to Brecon . Both canals were abandoned in 1962 , but the Brecknock and Abergavenny route and a small section of the Monmouthshire route have been reopened since 1970 .

From Bristol to Bath the waterway follows the natural course of the River Avon before the canal links it to the River Kennet at Newbury , and from there to Reading on the River Thames . In all , the waterway incorporates 105 locks . The two river stretches were made navigable in the early 18th century , and the 57-mile ( 92 km ) canal section was constructed between 1794 and 1810 . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the canal gradually fell into disuse after the opening of the Great Western Railway . In the latter half of the 20th century the canal was restored in stages , largely by volunteers . After decades of dereliction and much restoration work , it was fully reopened in 1990 .

  "/wiki/Llangollen_Canal": "The Llangollen Canal ( Welsh : Camlas Llangollen ) is a navigable canal crossing the border between England and Wales . The waterway links Llangollen in Denbighshire , north Wales , with Hurleston in south Cheshire , via the town of Ellesmere , Shropshire . The name , which was coined in the 1980s , is a modern designation for parts of the historic Ellesmere Canal and the Llangollen navigable feeder , both of which became part of the Shropshire Union Canals in 1846 . The Ellesmere Canal was proposed by industrialists at Ruabon and Brymbo , and two disconnected sections were built . The northern section ran from Ellesmere Port on the River Mersey to Chester , where it joined the Chester Canal , and opened in 1795 . Work on the southern section began at Frankton , with a line southwards to Llanymynech , and subsequently , a second section was built westwards towards Trevor . This involved crossing the Afon Ceiriog and the River Dee , which was achieved by building two vast aqueducts , using iron troughs to contain the water . The Ceiriog was crossed at Chirk , and Chirk Aqueduct opened in 1801 , to exploit local supplies of iron and coal . The canal then passed through Chirk Tunnel , and reached the southern end of Pontcysyllte Aqueduct in 1802 , which was not completed until 1805 . To join the two halves up , a heavily engineered route from Trevor Basin via Ruabon and Brymbo to the River Dee at Chester was planned , but very little of it was built . Instead , the present route from Frankton to Hurleston Junction on the Chester Canal was constructed , and opened in 1805 . As the route never reached the water reservoir at Moss Valley , Wrexham ( built in 1786 ) , a navigable feeder was built to Llantisilio where the Horseshoe Falls weir was constructed on the River Dee to supply the canal .",

The canal was built to export coal , limestone , and lead from Derbyshire , iron from Chesterfield , and corn , deals , timber , groceries and general merchandise into Derbyshire . The stone for the Palace of Westminster was quarried in North Anston , Rotherham , and transported via the canal . It was reasonably profitable , paying dividends from 1789 , and with the coming of the railways , some of the proprietors formed a railway company . It became part of the Manchester , Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway company , and although there were intermittent plans to convert parts of it to a railway , it continued to thrive as a canal . In 1907 , subsidence from local coal mines caused the collapse of the Norwood Tunnel , and the canal was effectively split in two . Subsequently , the main use of the Chesterfield end was the supply of water to the iron industry , while commercial carrying continued on the Worksop to Stockwith section until the late 1950s . It was formally closed in 1961 , but campaigners fought for it to be retained , and the Worksop to Stockwith section was designated as a cruiseway under the Transport Act 1968 , meaning that it would be retained for leisure use . The rest was designated as a remainder waterway , and parts were sold off , with housing being built over the route through Killamarsh .

At 37 miles ( 60 km ) long , it is the longest river entirely in Sussex and one of the longest starting in Sussex after the River Medway , River Wey and River Mole . From the series of small streams that form its source in the area of St Leonard 's Forest in the Weald , the Arun flows westwards through Horsham to Nowhurst where it is joined by the North River . Turning to the south , it is joined by its main tributary , the western River Rother , and continues through a gap in the South Downs to Arundel to join the English Channel at Littlehampton . It is one of the faster flowing rivers in England , and is tidal as far inland as Pallingham Quay , 25.5 miles ( 41.0 km ) upstream from the sea at Littlehampton . The Arun gives its name to the Arun local government district of West Sussex . The first major improvements to the river were made between the 1540s and the 1570s , when Arundel became a port , and navigation up to Pallingham was improved , but barges had difficulty negotiating the flash locks that were installed . The work was carried out by Henry FitzAlan , 19th Earl of Arundel , who made the upper section toll-free . Harbour commissioners managed the lower river from Arundel to the sea from 1732 , and major improvements to keep the estuary free from silt were sanctioned by an Act of Parliament obtained in 1793 . With the coming of the railways and changes in coastal shipping , Littlehampton superseded Arundel as the port of the Arun , and the Littlehampton harbour commissioners are still responsible for the river up to Arundel , collecting tolls for its use . The river above Arundel was improved after 1785 . As the main channel was toll-free , the proprietors of the scheme built two major cuts .",

The air vents that run along the line of the tunnel and provide ventilation , and a shaft of light into the canal , are known by the locals as pepper pots , because of their shape . They are brick-lined and the openings are covered by an iron frame or grill .",
  "/wiki/Oxford_Canal": "The Oxford Canal is a 78-mile ( 126 km ) narrow canal in central England linking Oxford with Bedworth ( between Coventry and Nuneaton on the Coventry Canal ) via Banbury and Rugby . Completed in 1790 , it connects to the River Thames at Oxford and is integrated with the Grand Union Canal - combined for 5 miles ( 8 km ) close to the villages of Braunston and Napton-on-the-Hill , a canal which soon after construction superseded much of its traffic . The canal was for approximately 15 years the main canal artery of trade between the Midlands and London ; it retained importance in its local county economies and that of Berkshire . Today the canal is frequently used in weekend and holiday narrowboat pleasure boating . The Oxford Canal traverses Oxfordshire , Northamptonshire and east Warwickshire through broad , shallow valleys and lightly rolling hills ; resembling the bulk of the Grand Union Canal and its branches , much of the landscape is similar to the Llangollen and Lancaster canals . It has frequent wharves and public houses , particularly if including the parts of the Grand Union Canal immediately adjoining . North of about a third of its distance , namely from Napton , the canal travelling northeast then northwest forms part of the Warwickshire ring . In its south extreme it forms a waterway circuit within Oxford known as the Four Rivers .",
