He directed the first implementation of the language Logo for the Apple II , which made the language widely available on personal computers starting in 1981 ; and published a widely selling book on Logo in 1982 . Together with Gerald Jay Sussman , Abelson developed MIT 's introductory computer science subject , The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs ( called by the course number , 6.001 ) , a subject organized around the idea that a computer language is primarily a formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology , rather than just a way to get a computer to perform operations . Abelson and Sussman also cooperate in codirecting the MIT Project on Mathematics and Computation . The MIT OpenCourseWare ( OCW ) project was spearheaded by Abelson and other MIT faculty . Abelson led an internal investigation of the school 's choices and role in the prosecution of Aaron Swartz by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , which concluded that MIT did nothing wrong legally , but recommended that MIT consider changing some of its internal policies .",

  "/wiki/Mathematical_logic": "Mathematical logic is a subfield of mathematics exploring the applications of formal logic to mathematics . It bears close connections to metamathematics , the foundations of mathematics , and theoretical computer science . The unifying themes in mathematical logic include the study of the expressive power of formal systems and the deductive power of formal proof systems . Mathematical logic is often divided into the fields of set theory , model theory , recursion theory , and proof theory . These areas share basic results on logic , particularly first-order logic , and definability . In computer science ( particularly in the ACM Classification ) mathematical logic encompasses additional topics not detailed in this article ; see Logic in computer science for those . Since its inception , mathematical logic has both contributed to , and has been motivated by , the study of foundations of mathematics . This study began in the late 19th century with the development of axiomatic frameworks for geometry , arithmetic , and analysis . In the early 20th century it was shaped by David Hilbert 's program to prove the consistency of foundational theories . Results of Kurt G\u00f6del , Gerhard Gentzen , and others provided partial resolution to the program , and clarified the issues involved in proving consistency . Work in set theory showed that almost all ordinary mathematics can be formalized in terms of sets , although there are some theorems that can not be proven in common axiom systems for set theory . Contemporary work in the foundations of mathematics often focuses on establishing which parts of mathematics can be formalized in particular formal systems ( as in reverse mathematics ) rather than trying to find theories in which all of mathematics can be developed .",

He holds a joint appointment as Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) and Laureate Professor at the University of Arizona , and is the author of more than 100 books on topics such as linguistics , war , politics , and mass media . Ideologically , he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism . Born to Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia , Chomsky developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in New York City . He studied at the University of Pennsylvania . During his postgraduate work in the Harvard Society of Fellows , Chomsky developed the theory of transformational grammar for which he earned his doctorate in 1955 . That year he began teaching at MIT , and in 1957 emerged as a significant figure in linguistics with his landmark work Syntactic Structures , which played a major role in remodeling the study of language . From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study . He created or co-created the universal grammar theory , the generative grammar theory , the Chomsky hierarchy , and the minimalist program . Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of linguistic behaviorism , and was particularly critical of the work of B. F. Skinner . An outspoken opponent of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War , which he saw as an act of American imperialism , in 1967 Chomsky rose to national attention for his antiwar essay The Responsibility of Intellectuals .",

First elected president of the French Second Republic in 1848 , he seized power in 1851 , when he could not constitutionally be re-elected , and became the Emperor of the French . He founded the Second French Empire and was its only emperor until the defeat of the French army and his capture by Prussia and its allies in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 . He worked to modernize the French economy , rebuilt the center of Paris , expanded the French overseas empire , and engaged in the Crimean War and the Second Italian War of Independence . Napoleon III commissioned a grand reconstruction of Paris carried out by his prefect of the Seine , Baron Haussmann , and launched similar public works projects in Marseille , Lyon and other French cities . Napoleon III modernized the French banking system , expanded and consolidated the French railway system , and made the French merchant marine the second largest in the world . He promoted the building of the Suez Canal and established modern agriculture , which ended famines in France and made France an agricultural exporter . Napoleon III negotiated the 1860 Cobden-Chevalier free trade agreement with Britain and similar agreements with France 's other European trading partners . Social reforms included giving French workers the right to strike and the right to organize . The first women students were admitted at the Sorbonne and educational opportunities for women were increased , as did the list of required subjects in public schools .

  "/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848": "The Revolutions of 1848 , known in some countries as the Spring of Nations , People 's Spring , Springtime of the Peoples , or the Year of Revolution , were a series of political upheavals throughout Europe in 1848 . It remains the most widespread revolutionary wave in European history . The revolutions were essentially bourgeois revolutions and democratic and liberal in nature , with the aim of removing the old monarchical structures and creating independent nation-states . The revolutions spread across Europe after an initial revolution began in France in February . Over 50 countries were affected , but with no significant coordination or cooperation among their respective revolutionaries . Some of the major contributing factors were widespread dissatisfaction with political leadership , demands for more participation in government and democracy , demands for freedom of the press , other demands made by the working class , the upsurge of nationalism , and the regrouping of established government forces . The uprisings were led by ad hoc coalitions of reformers , the middle classes and workers , which did not hold together for long . Many of the revolutions were quickly suppressed ; tens of thousands of people were killed , and many more were forced into exile . Significant lasting reforms included the abolition of serfdom in Austria and Hungary , the end of absolute monarchy in Denmark , and the introduction of representative democracy in the Netherlands . The revolutions were most important in France , the Netherlands , the states of the German Confederation that would make up the German Empire in the late 19th and early 20th century , Italy , and the Austrian Empire .",

'Eastern War ' ; Turkish : K\u0131r\u0131m Sava\u015f\u0131 ; Italian : Guerra di Crimea ) was a military conflict fought from October 1853 to February 1856 in which the Russian Empire lost to an alliance made up of the Ottoman Empire , France , Britain and Sardinia . The immediate cause of the war involved the rights of Christian minorities in the Holy Land , which was a part of the Ottoman Empire . The French promoted the rights of Roman Catholics , while Russia promoted those of the Eastern Orthodox Church . The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of Britain and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at the Ottoman Empire 's expense . It has widely been noted that the causes , in one case involving an argument over a key , have never revealed a greater confusion of purpose , yet they led to a war noted for its notoriously incompetent international butchery . While the churches worked out their differences and came to an agreement , Nicholas I of Russia and the French Emperor Napoleon III refused to back down . Nicholas issued an ultimatum that the Orthodox subjects of the Ottoman Empire be placed under his protection . Britain attempted to mediate and arranged a compromise that Nicholas agreed to . When the Ottomans demanded changes to the agreement , Nicholas recanted and prepared for war . Having obtained promises of support from France and Britain , the Ottomans declared war on Russia in October 1853 . The war started in the Balkans in July 1853 , when Russian troops occupied the Danubian Principalities ( now part of Romania ) , which were under Ottoman suzerainty , then began to cross the Danube .",

Wallace , Jr. Astrophysical Observatory until his death on March 3 , 2011 . There is some debate on whether Elliot , et al . discovered the rings of Uranus , or whether William Herschel made an observation in 1797 . However , scientific consensus seems to support Elliot as the discoverer . Elliot is credited by the Minor Planet Center with one minor planet , the trans-Neptunian object ( 95625 ) 2002 GX32 , which he co-discovered at CTIO in 2002 . The main-belt asteroid 3193 Elliot , discovered by astronomer Edward Bowell at Anderson Mesa Station in 1983 , was named in his honor . The crater Elliot on Pluto is also named in his honor ."
