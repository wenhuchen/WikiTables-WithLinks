  "/wiki/Chief_Joseph": "Hin-mah-too-yah-lat-kekt ( or Hinmat\u00f3owyalahtq\u0313it in Americanist orthography ) , popularly known as Chief Joseph , Young Joseph , or Joseph the Younger ( March 3 , 1840 - September 21 , 1904 ) , was a leader of the Wal-lam-wat-kain ( Wallowa ) band of Nez Perce , a Native American tribe of the interior Pacific Northwest region of the United States , in the latter half of the 19th century . He succeeded his father Tuekakas ( Chief Joseph the Elder ) in the early 1870s . Chief Joseph led his band of Nez Perce during the most tumultuous period in their history , when they were forcibly removed by the United States federal government from their ancestral lands in the Wallowa Valley of northeastern Oregon onto a significantly reduced reservation in the Idaho Territory . A series of violent encounters with white settlers in the spring of 1877 culminated in those Nez Perce who resisted removal , including Joseph 's band and an allied band of the Palouse tribe , to flee the United States in an attempt to reach political asylum alongside the Lakota people , who had sought refuge in Canada under the leadership of Sitting Bull . At least 700 men , women , and children led by Joseph and other Nez Perce chiefs were pursued by the U.S. Army under General Oliver O. Howard in a 1,170-mile ( 1,900 km ) fighting retreat known as the Nez Perce War . The skill with which the Nez Perce fought and the manner in which they conducted themselves in the face of incredible adversity earned them widespread admiration from their military opponents and the American public , and coverage of the war in U.S. newspapers led to popular recognition of Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce . In October 1877 , after months of fugitive resistance , most of the surviving remnants of Joseph 's band were cornered in northern Montana Territory , just 40 miles ( 64 km ) from the Canadian border . Unable to fight any longer , Chief Joseph surrendered to the Army with the understanding that he and his people would be allowed to return to the reservation in western Idaho . He was instead transported between various forts and reservations on the southern Great Plains before being moved to the Colville Indian Reservation in the state of Washington , where he died in 1904 . Chief Joseph 's life remains iconic of the American Indian Wars . For his passionate , principled resistance to his tribe 's forced removal , Joseph became renowned as a humanitarian and peacemaker .",

  "/wiki/World_War_I": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",

The term is an exonym created from a French transcription of the Anishinaabe term Nadouessioux , and can refer to any ethnic group within the Great Sioux Nation or to any of the nation 's many language dialects . The modern Sioux consist of two major divisions based on language divisions : the Dakota and Lakota . Before the 17th century , the Santee Dakota ( Is\u00e1\u014byathi ; Knife also known as the Eastern Dakota ) lived around Lake Superior with territories in present-day northern Minnesota and Wisconsin . They gathered wild rice , hunted woodland animals and used canoes to fish . Wars with the Ojibwe throughout the 1700s pushed the Dakota into southern Minnesota , where the Western Dakota ( Yankton , Yanktonai ) and Teton ( Lakota ) were residing . In the 1800s , the Dakota signed treaties with the United States , ceding much of their land in Minnesota . Failure of the United States to make treaty payments on time , as well as low food supplies , led to the Dakota War of 1862 , which resulted in the Dakota being exiled from Minnesota to numerous reservations in Nebraska , North and South Dakota and Canada . After 1870 , the Dakota people began to return to Minnesota , creating the present-day reservations in the state . The Yankton and Yanktonai Dakota ( Ih\u00e1\u014bkt\u021fu\u014bwa\u014b and Ih\u00e1\u014bkt\u021fu\u014bwa\u014bna ; Village-at-the-end and Little village-at-the-end ) , collectively also referred to by the endonym Wi\u010dh\u00edyena , resided in the Minnesota River area before ceding their land and moving to South Dakota in 1858 .

  "/wiki/George_Armstrong_Custer": "George Armstrong Custer ( December 5 , 1839 - June 25 , 1876 ) was a United States Army officer and cavalry commander in the American Civil War and the American Indian Wars . Custer graduated from West Point in 1861 at the bottom of his class , but as the Civil War was just starting , trained officers were in immediate demand . He worked closely with General McClellan and the future General Pleasonton , both of whom recognized his qualities as a cavalry leader , and he was brevetted brigadier general of volunteers at age 23 . Only a few days after his promotion , he fought at Gettysburg , where he commanded the Michigan Cavalry Brigade and despite being outnumbered , defeated J. E. B. Stuart 's attack at what is now known as the East Cavalry Field . In 1864 , Custer served in the Overland Campaign and in Sheridan 's army in the Shenandoah Valley , defeating Jubal Early at Cedar Creek . His division blocked the Army of Northern Virginia 's final retreat and received the first flag of truce from the Confederates , and Custer was present at Robert E. Lee 's surrender to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox . After the war , Custer was appointed a lieutenant colonel in the Regular Army and was sent west to fight in the Indian Wars . On June 25 , 1876 , while leading the 7th Cavalry Regiment at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in Montana Territory against a coalition of Native American tribes , he was killed along with all of his command during an action later romanticized as Custer 's Last Stand . His dramatic end was as controversial as the rest of his career , and reaction to his life and career remains deeply divided .

  "/wiki/Battle_of_the_Little_Bighorn": "The Battle of the Little Bighorn , known to the Lakota and other Plains Indians as the Battle of the Greasy Grass and also commonly referred to as Custer 's Last Stand , was an armed engagement between combined forces of the Lakota , Northern Cheyenne , and Arapaho tribes and the 7th Cavalry Regiment of the United States Army . The battle , which resulted in the defeat of U.S. forces , was the most significant action of the Great Sioux War of 1876 . It took place on June 25-26 , 1876 , along the Little Bighorn River in the Crow Indian Reservation in southeastern Montana Territory . The fight was an overwhelming victory for the Lakota , Northern Cheyenne , and Arapaho , who were led by several major war leaders , including Crazy Horse and Chief Gall , and had been inspired by the visions of Sitting Bull ( T\u021fat\u021f\u00e1\u014bka \u00cdyotake ) . The U.S. 7th Cavalry , a force of 700 men , suffered a major defeat while under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer ( formerly a brevetted major general during the American Civil War ) . Five of the 7th Cavalry 's twelve companies were annihilated and Custer was killed , as were two of his brothers , a nephew and a brother-in-law . The total U.S. casualty count included 268 dead and 55 severely wounded ( six died later from their wounds ) , :244 including four Crow Indian scouts and at least two Arikara Indian scouts .

  "/wiki/Black_Hills_War": "The Great Sioux War of 1876 , also known as the Black Hills War , was a series of battles and negotiations which occurred in 1876 and 1877 between the Lakota Sioux , Northern Cheyenne , and the United States . The cause of the war was the desire of the U.S. government to obtain ownership of the Black Hills . Gold had been discovered in the Black Hills , settlers began to encroach onto Native American lands , and the Sioux and Cheyenne refused to cede ownership to the U.S . Traditionally , the United States military and historians place the Lakota at the center of the story , especially given their numbers , but some Indians believe the Cheyenne were the primary target of the U.S. campaign . Among the many battles and skirmishes of the war was the Battle of the Little Bighorn , often known as Custer 's Last Stand , the most storied of the many encounters between the U.S. army and mounted Plains Indians . That Indian victory notwithstanding , the U.S. leveraged national resources to force the Indians to surrender , primarily by attacking and destroying their encampments and property . The Great Sioux War took place under the presidencies of Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes .

The previous day , a detachment of the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment commanded by Major Samuel M. Whitside intercepted Spotted Elk 's band of Miniconjou Lakota and 38 Hunkpapa Lakota near Porcupine Butte and escorted them 5 miles ( 8.0 km ) westward to Wounded Knee Creek , where they made camp . The remainder of the 7th Cavalry Regiment , led by Colonel James W. Forsyth , arrived and surrounded the encampment . The regiment was supported by a battery of four Hotchkiss mountain guns . On the morning of December 29 , the U.S. Cavalry troops went into the camp to disarm the Lakota . One version of events claims that during the process of disarming the Lakota , a deaf tribesman named Black Coyote was reluctant to give up his rifle , claiming he had paid a lot for it . Simultaneously , an old man was performing a ritual called the Ghost Dance . Black Coyote 's rifle went off at that point , and the U.S. army began shooting at the Native Americans . The Lakota warriors fought back , but many had already been stripped of their guns and disarmed . By the time the massacre was over , between 250 and 300 men , women , and children of the Lakota had been killed and 51 were wounded ( 4 men and 47 women and children , some of whom died later ) ; some estimates placed the number of dead at 300 .

Geronimo 's raids and related combat actions were a part of the prolonged period of the Apache-United States conflict , which started with American settlement in Apache lands following the end of the war with Mexico in 1848 . While well known , Geronimo was not a chief of the Chiricahua or the Bedonkohe band . :38:1-2 However , since he was a superb leader in raiding and warfare , he frequently led large numbers of men beyond his own following . At any one time , he would be in command of about 30 to 50 Apaches . During Geronimo 's final period of conflict from 1876 to 1886 , he surrendered three times and accepted life on the Apache reservations in Arizona . Reservation life was confining to the free-moving Apache people , and they resented restrictions on their customary way of life . In 1886 , after an intense pursuit in northern Mexico by American forces that followed Geronimo 's third 1885 reservation breakout , Geronimo surrendered for the last time to Lt. Charles Bare Gatewood , an Apache-speaking West Point graduate who had earned Geronimo 's respect a few years before . Geronimo was later transferred to General Nelson Miles at Skeleton Canyon , just north of the Mexican/American boundary . Miles treated Geronimo as a prisoner of war and acted promptly to move Geronimo , first to Fort Bowie , then to the railroad at Bowie Station , Arizona , where he and 27 other Apaches were sent to join the rest of the Chiricahua tribe , which had been previously exiled to Florida . While holding him as a prisoner , the United States capitalized on Geronimos fame among non-Indians by displaying him at various events .",
