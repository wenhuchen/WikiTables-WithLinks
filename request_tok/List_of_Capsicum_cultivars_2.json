  "/wiki/Scoville_scale": "The Scoville scale is a measurement of the pungency ( spiciness or heat ) of chili peppers and other spicy foods , as recorded in Scoville Heat Units ( SHU ) based on the concentration of capsaicinoids , among which capsaicin is the predominant component . The scale is named after its creator , American pharmacist Wilbur Scoville , whose 1912 method is known as the Scoville organoleptic test . The Scoville organoleptic test is the most practical method for estimating SHU and is a subjective assessment derived from the capsaicinoid sensitivity by people experienced with eating hot chilis . An alternative method , using high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) can be used to analytically quantify the capsaicinoid content as an indicator of pungency . As of 2011 , the subjective organoleptic test has been largely superseded by analytical methods such as chromatography .",

It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north , French Guiana to the east , Guyana to the west and Brazil to the south . At just under 165,000 square kilometers ( 64,000 square miles ) , it is the smallest sovereign state in South America . [ note 1 ] Suriname has a population of approximately 575,990 , most of whom live on the country 's north coast , in and around the capital and largest city , Paramaribo . Suriname was long inhabited by various indigenous people before being invaded and contested by European powers from the 16th century , eventually coming under Dutch rule in the late 17th century . As the chief sugar colony during the Dutch colonial period , it was primarily a plantation economy dependent on African slaves and , following the abolition of slavery in 1863 , indentured servants from Asia . Suriname was ruled by the Dutch-chartered company Society of Suriname between 1683 and 1795 . In 1954 , Suriname became one of the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands . On 25 November 1975 , the country of Suriname left the Kingdom of the Netherlands to become an independent state , nonetheless maintaining close economic , diplomatic , and cultural ties to its former colonizer . Suriname is considered to be a culturally Caribbean country , and is a member of the Caribbean Community ( CARICOM ) . While Dutch is the official language of government , business , media , and education , Sranan Tongo , an English-based creole language , is a widely used lingua franca . Suriname is the only sovereign nation outside Europe where Dutch is spoken by a majority of the population .",

  "/wiki/Interspecific_hybrid": "In biology , a hybrid is the offspring resulting from combining the qualities of two organisms of different breeds , varieties , species or genera through sexual reproduction . Hybrids are not always intermediates between their parents ( such as in blending inheritance ) , but can show hybrid vigour , sometimes growing larger or taller than either parent . The concept of a hybrid is interpreted differently in animal and plant breeding , where there is interest in the individual parentage . In genetics , attention is focused on the numbers of chromosomes . In taxonomy , a key question is how closely related the parent species are . Species are reproductively isolated by strong barriers to hybridisation , which include genetic and morphological differences , differing times of fertility , mating behaviors and cues , and physiological rejection of sperm cells or the developing embryo . Some act before fertilization and others after it . Similar barriers exist in plants , with differences in flowering times , pollen vectors , inhibition of pollen tube growth , somatoplastic sterility , cytoplasmic-genic male sterility and the structure of the chromosomes . A few animal species and many plant species , however , are the result of hybrid speciation , including important crop plants such as wheat , where the number of chromosomes has been doubled . Human impact on the environment has resulted in an increase in the interbreeding between regional species , and the proliferation of introduced species worldwide has also resulted in an increase in hybridisation . This genetic mixing may threaten many species with extinction , while genetic erosion in crop plants may be damaging the gene pools of many species for future breeding . A form of often intentional human-mediated hybridisation is the crossing of wild and domesticated species .",

He described first trying his new pepper as : When I tried it tasted nice at first , like an odd fruity taste , the effect is delayed . Then it hit me . All of a sudden I felt it burning in the back of my throat , so hot that I could n't speak . I began to shake uncontrollably , I had to sit down , I felt physically sick . I really would n't recommend anybody eat it raw like that . A restaurant in Grantham called Bindi served a curry , called The Widower , made with 20 Infinity chilies , claiming to be the world 's hottest curry .
