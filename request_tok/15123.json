Since the foundation of the first Moroccan state by Idris I in 788 AD , the country has been ruled by a series of independent dynasties , reaching its zenith under Almoravid and Almohad rule , when it spanned parts of Iberia and northwestern Africa . The Marinid and Saadi dynasties resisted foreign domination into the 17th century , allowing Morocco to remain the only northwest African country to avoid Ottoman occupation . The Alaouite dynasty , which rules to this day , seized power in 1631 . The country 's strategic location near the mouth of the Mediterranean attracted the interest of Europe , and in 1912 , Morocco was divided into French and Spanish protectorates , with an international zone in Tangier . It regained its independence in 1956 , and has since remained comparatively stable and prosperous by regional standards , with the fifth largest economy in Africa .",

Both species were known solely from their holotypes , two partial skulls that were housed at the Bavarian State Collection for Palaeontogy and Geology . Both specimens were collected at Ebrach Quarry , bed number 13 from the late Carnian-aged Blasensandstein Member of the Hassberge Formation . As the holotypes were destroyed during World War II and poorly documented , Francosuchus and its species are usually considered to be nomina dubia . Kuhn ( 1936 ) described and named a third species of this genus , Francosuchus angustifrons , on a basis of another skull from the same quarry , bed number 9 . This species was recently reassigned to Paleorhinus , because it shares unique synapomorphies with P. bransoni ( the type species of Paleorhinus ) , and a species-level phylogenetic analysis of phytosaurs found the species to be sister taxa . Friedrich von Huene ( 1939 ) described and named a fourth species , Francosuchus trauthi .

Fossils have been found from the Dockum Group and lower Chinle Formation outcropping in Texas , New Mexico , and Arizona , USA , and date back to the Carnian stage of the Late Triassic . Currently there are believed to be four species of Leptosuchus . All species share in common a similar position of the temporal arch below the skull roof and a posterior process of the squamosal that extends farther than the paroccipital process . The type species is L. crosbiensis , which was named in 1922 on the basis of material found from Texas . L. adamanensis was first described in 1930 as a species of Machaeroprosopus from the Blue Mesa Member of Petrified Forest National Park , along with the other two species , L. lithodendrorum and L. gregorii . It was not until the publication of a 1995 paper on tetrapods of southwestern United States that these species were recognized as belonging to the genus Leptosuchus . However , because of the distinctive size of the rostral crest in L. gregorii , it was assigned to its own genus , Smilosuchus , in that same paper . Despite this , L. gregorii has recently been seen as belonging to Leptosuchus , as it is believed that the large , complete crest was independently developed in this particular species . The close relation of Leptosuchus and Machaeroprosopus with Rutiodon has led some paleontologists to believe that the prior two were synonymous with Rutiodon , with the latter 's name having seniority . Differing features seen in the three phytosaurs have been attributed to sexual dimorphism , differing growth stages , or individual variation , while similarities could be seen in the rostral crest and the position of the nares . Previously it was believed that these were different genera due to the geographical isolation that could be seen in North American phytosaurs ; Leptosuchus remains were found primarily in southern localities while Rutiodon remains could be found in more eastern localities .",

The skulls have been lost since the 1950s , and a line drawing in the original 1916 description is the only visual record of the specimen . Another species , M. andersoni , was named in 1922 from New Mexico , and the species M. adamanensis , M. gregorii , M. lithodendrorum , M. tenuis , and M. zunii were named in 1930 . Most species have been reassigned to the genera Smilosuchus , Rutiodon , Pseudopalatus , or Phytosaurus . Until recently , M. validus was considered to be the only species that has not been reassigned . Thus , Machaeroprosopus was considered to be a nomen dubium or doubtful name because of the lack of diagnostic specimens that can support its distinction from other phytosaur genera . However , a taxonomic revision of Machaeroprosopus , conducted by Parker et al . ( in press ) , revealed that UW 3807 , the holotype of M. validus , is not the holotype of Machaeroprosopus , while the previously named species Pseudopalatus buceros has priority as the type species of the genus . Therefore , the name Pseudopalatus must be considered a junior synonym of Machaeroprosopus , and all species of the former must be reassigned to the later . This revised taxonomy was already accepted in several studies , including Stocker and Butler ( 2013 ) .

  "/wiki/Mesorhinosuchus": "Mesorhinosuchus is an extinct genus of basal phytosaur possibly known from the Early Triassic ( early Olenekian stage ) of Saxony-Anhalt , central-eastern Germany . It was first named by Otto Jaekel in 1910 and the type species is Mesorhinus fraasi . The generic name Mesorhinus was preoccupied by Mesorhinus piramydatus Ameghino , 1885 , a macraucheniid meridiungulatan mammal . Thus , an alternative generic name , Mesorhinosuchus , was proposed by Oskar Kuhn in 1961 . The genus is occasionally misspelled as Mesorhinosaurus , while Stocker and Butler ( 2013 ) recently misspelled its original generic name as Mesosuchus . Jaekel ( 1910 ) described the taxon on the basis of a single specimen he found in the collections of the University of G\u00f6ttingen , with a label that identified it as a temnospondyl from the Lower Buntsandstein ( Early Triassic ) of Saxony-Anhalt . The holotype , unnumbered GZG partial skull with the anterior tip missing , was destroyed during World War II . According to Stocker and Butler ( 2013 ) , based on the photograph in the original description , the holotype skull was undoubtedly phytosaurian , making it putatively stratigraphically lowest phytosaur known . Jaekel ( 1910 ) found a potential match of the sediment in which the skull was preserved to the Wipperbr\u00fccke , Parforcehaus locality , a horizon at the very base of the Middle Buntsandstein near Bernburg . This would make the specimen early Olenekian ( Smithian ) in age . However , because the holotype was destroyed with no surviving casts , and its provenance can not be confirmed without new specimens , it have been largely ignored by recent authors , or assumed that its reported stratigraphic occurrence was incorrect . Various authors referred M. fraasi to as Paleorhinus fraasi or Parasuchus fraasi , while a more recent review of the Phytosauria , by Stocker and Butler ( 2013 ) , refrained from doing so , assigning it to Phytosauria Incertae sedis .",

  "/wiki/Junior_synonym": "In scientific nomenclature , a synonym is a scientific name that applies to a taxon that ( now ) goes by a different scientific name , although the term is used somewhat differently in the zoological code of nomenclature . For example , Linnaeus was the first to give a scientific name ( under the currently used system of scientific nomenclature ) to the Norway spruce , which he called Pinus abies . This name is no longer in use : it is now a synonym of the current scientific name , Picea abies . Unlike synonyms in other contexts , in taxonomy a synonym is not interchangeable with the name of which it is a synonym . In taxonomy , synonyms are not equals , but have a different status . For any taxon with a particular circumscription , position , and rank , only one scientific name is considered to be the correct one at any given time ( this correct name is to be determined by applying the relevant code of nomenclature ) . A synonym can not exist in isolation : it is always an alternative to a different scientific name . Given that the correct name of a taxon depends on the taxonomic viewpoint used ( resulting in a particular circumscription , position and rank ) a name that is one taxonomist 's synonym may be another taxonomist 's correct name ( and vice versa ) . Synonyms may arise whenever the same taxon is described and named more than once , independently . They may also arise when existing taxa are changed , as when two taxa are joined to become one , a species is moved to a different genus , a variety is moved to a different species , etc . Synonyms also come about when the codes of nomenclature change , so that older names are no longer acceptable ; for example , Erica herbacea L. has been rejected in favour of Erica carnea L. and is thus its synonym .",
  "/wiki/Poland": "Poland ( Polish : Polska [ \u02c8p\u0254lska ] ( listen ) ) , officially the Republic of Poland ( Polish : Rzeczpospolita Polska [ c ] [ \u0290\u025bt\u0361\u0282p\u0254\u02c8sp\u0254lita \u02c8p\u0254lska ] ( listen ) ) , is a country located in Central Europe . It is divided into 16 administrative subdivisions , covering an area of 312,696 square kilometres ( 120,733 sq mi ) , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate . With a population of nearly 38.5 million people , Poland is the fifth most populous member state of the European Union . Poland 's capital and largest metropolis is Warsaw . Other major cities include Krak\u00f3w , \u0141\u00f3d\u017a , Wroc\u0142aw , Pozna\u0144 , Gda\u0144sk , and Szczecin . Poland is bordered by the Baltic Sea , Lithuania , and Russia 's Kaliningrad Oblast to the north , Belarus and Ukraine to the east , Slovakia and the Czech Republic to the south , and Germany to the west . The history of human activity on Polish soil spans almost 500,000 years . Throughout the Iron Age the area became extensively diverse , with various cultures and tribes settling on the vast Central European Plain . However , it was the Western Polans who dominated the region and gave Poland its name . The establishment of Polish statehood can be traced to AD 966 , when Mieszko I , ruler of the realm coextensive with the territory of present-day Poland , converted to Christianity . The Kingdom of Poland was founded in 1025 , and in 1569 it cemented its longstanding political association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the Union of Lublin . This union formed the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , one of the largest ( over 1,000,000 square kilometres - 400,000 square miles ) and most populous countries of 16th and 17th century Europe , with a uniquely liberal political system which adopted Europe 's first written national constitution , the Constitution of 3 May 1791 .",

  "/wiki/India": "India ( Hindi : Bh\u0101rat ) , officially the Republic of India ( Hindi : Bh\u0101rat Ga\u1e47ar\u0101jya ) , is a country in South Asia . It is the seventh-largest country by area , the second-most populous country , and the most populous democracy in the world . Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south , the Arabian Sea on the southwest , and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast , it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west ; [ e ] China , Nepal , and Bhutan to the north ; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east . In the Indian Ocean , India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives ; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia . Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",

  "/wiki/Pravusuchus": "Pravusuchus is an extinct genus of leptosuchomorph phytosaurid phytosaur known from the Late Triassic ( Norian stage ) of Arizona , United States . It contains a single species , Pravusuchus hortus , which is known from three specimens . These specimens were previously referred to Smilosuchus or to Leptosuchus , but Pravusuchus 's autapomorphy , its phylogenetic position as well as a trait shared with pseudopalatines , justified the erection of a new taxon for the material ."
