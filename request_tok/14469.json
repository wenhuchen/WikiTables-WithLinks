  "/wiki/Underground_Railroad": "The Underground Railroad was a network of secret routes and safe houses established in the United States during the early to mid-19th century , and used by enslaved African-Americans to escape into free states and Canada . The scheme was assisted by abolitionists and others sympathetic to the cause of the escapees . Not literally a railroad , the workers ( both black and white , free and enslaved ) who secretly aided the fugitives are also collectively referred to as the Underground Railroad . Various other routes led to Mexico , where slavery had been abolished , or overseas . An earlier escape route running south toward Florida , then a Spanish possession ( except 1763-83 ) , existed from the late 17th century until Florida became a United States territory in 1821 . One of the main reasons Florida was purchased by the United States was to end its function as a safe haven for escaped slaves . However , the network now generally known as the Underground Railroad was formed in the late 1700s . It ran north and grew steadily until the Civil War began . One estimate suggests that by 1850 , 100,000 slaves had escaped via the Railroad . British North America ( present-day Canada ) was a desirable destination , as its long border gave many points of access , it was further from slave catchers , and beyond the reach of the United States ' Fugitive Slave Acts . Most former slaves , reaching Canada by boat across Lake Erie and Lake Ontario , settled in Ontario . More than 30,000 people were said to have escaped there via the network during its 20-year peak period , although U.S. Census figures account for only 6,000 .",
