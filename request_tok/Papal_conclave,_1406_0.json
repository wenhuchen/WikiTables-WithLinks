These orders include the Order of Friars Minor , the Order of Saint Clare , and the Third Order of Saint Francis . They adhere to the teachings and spiritual disciplines of the founder and of his main associates and followers , such as Clare of Assisi , Anthony of Padua , and Elizabeth of Hungary , among many others . [ failed verification ] Francis began preaching around 1207 and traveled to Rome to seek approval from Pope Innocent III in 1209 to form a new religious order . The original Rule of Saint Francis approved by the Pope did not allow ownership of property , requiring members of the order to beg for food while preaching . The austerity was meant to emulate the life and ministry of Jesus Christ . Franciscans traveled and preached in the streets , while staying in church properties . Saint Clare , under Francis 's guidance , founded the Poor Clares ( Order of Saint Clare ) in 1212 , which remains a Second Order of the Franciscans . The extreme poverty required of members was relaxed in the final revision of the Rule in 1223 . The degree of observance required of members remained a major source of conflict within the order , resulting in numerous secessions . The Order of Friars Minor , previously known as the Observant branch , is one of the three Franciscan First Orders within the Catholic Church , the others being the Conventuals ( formed 1517 ) and Capuchins ( 1520 ) .

  "/wiki/Cardinal-nephew": "A cardinal-nephew ( Latin : cardinalis nepos ; Italian : cardinale nipote ; Spanish : valido de su t\u00edo ; French : prince de fortune ) was a cardinal elevated by a pope who was that cardinal 's relative . The practice of creating cardinal-nephews originated in the Middle Ages , and reached its apex during the 16th and 17th centuries . The last cardinal-nephew was named in 1689 and the practice was extinguished in 1692 . The word nepotism originally referred specifically to this practice , when it appeared in the English language about 1669 . From the middle of the Avignon Papacy ( 1309-1377 ) until Pope Innocent XII 's anti-nepotism bull ( a papal charter ) , Romanum decet pontificem ( 1692 ) , a pope without a cardinal-nephew was the exception to the rule . Every Renaissance pope who created cardinals appointed a relative to the College of Cardinals , and the nephew was the most common choice , although one of Alexander VI 's creations was his own son . The institution of the cardinal-nephew evolved over seven centuries , tracking developments in the history of the papacy and the styles of individual Popes . From 1566 until 1692 , a cardinal-nephew held the curial office of the Superintendent of the Ecclesiastical State , known as the Cardinal Nephew , and thus the terms are sometimes used interchangeably . The curial office of the Cardinal Nephew as well as the institution of the cardinal-nephew declined as the power of the Cardinal Secretary of State increased and the temporal power of popes decreased in the 17th and 18th centuries . The list of cardinal-nephews includes at least fifteen , and possibly as many as nineteen popes ( Gregory IX , Alexander IV , Adrian V , Gregory XI , Boniface IX , Innocent VII , Eugene IV , Paul II , Alexander VI , Pius III , Julius II , Leo X , Clement VII , Benedict XIII , and Pius VII ; perhaps also John XIX and Benedict IX , if they were really promoted cardinals ; as well as Innocent III and Benedict XII , if in fact they were related to their elevators ) ; one antipope ( John XXIII ) ; and two or three saints ( Charles Borromeo , Guarinus of Palestrina , and perhaps Anselm of Lucca , if he was really a cardinal ) .",
