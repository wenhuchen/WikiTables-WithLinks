The Ta\u00edno people had eventually moved north over many years , and lived around the Caribbean islands . The Ta\u00edno natives had done quite well for themselves and were on their way to being an organized civilization . Christopher Columbus explored and claimed the island , landing here on his first voyage in 1492 . The colony of Santo Domingo became the site of the first permanent European settlement in the Americas , the oldest continuously inhabited city , and the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World . Meanwhile , France occupied the western third of Hispaniola , naming their colony Saint-Domingue , which became the independent state of Haiti in 1804 . After more than three hundred years of Spanish rule the Dominican people declared independence in November 1821 . The leader of the independence movement Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres , intended the Dominican nation to unite with the country of Gran Colombia , but the newly independent Dominicans were forcefully annexed by Haiti in February 1822 .",

It occupies the western three-eighths of the island which it shares with the Dominican Republic . To its south-west lies the small island of Navassa Island , which is claimed by Haiti but is disputed as a United States territory under federal administration . Haiti is 27,750 square kilometers ( 10,714 sq mi ) in size and has an estimated population of 11.1 million , making it the most populous country in the Caribbean Community ( CARICOM ) and the second-most populous country in the Caribbean after Cuba . The island was originally inhabited by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people , who migrated from South America . The first Europeans arrived on 5 December 1492 during the first voyage of Christopher Columbus , who initially believed he had found India or China . Columbus subsequently founded the first European settlement in the Americas , La Navidad , on what is now the northeastern coast of Haiti . The island was claimed by Spain and named La Espa\u00f1ola , forming part of the Spanish Empire until the early 17th century . However , competing claims and settlements by the French led to the western portion of the island being ceded to France in 1697 , which was subsequently named Saint-Domingue . French colonists established lucrative sugarcane plantations , worked by vast numbers of slaves brought from Africa , which made the colony one of the richest in the world . In the midst of the French Revolution ( 1789-99 ) , slaves and free people of color launched the Haitian Revolution ( 1791-1804 ) , led by a former slave and the first black general of the French Army , Toussaint Louverture . After 12 years of conflict , Napoleon Bonaparte 's forces were defeated by Louverture 's successor , Jean-Jacques Dessalines ( later Emperor Jacques I ) , who declared Haiti 's sovereignty on 1 January 1804 - the first independent nation of Latin America and the Caribbean , the second republic in the Americas , the first country to abolish slavery , and the only state in history established by a successful slave revolt .",

Originally inhabited by the indigenous Arawak and Ta\u00edno peoples , the island came under Spanish rule following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494 . Many of the indigenous people were either killed or died of diseases to which they had no immunity , and the Spanish thus forcibly transplanted large numbers of African slaves to Jamaica as labourers . The island remained a possession of Spain until 1655 , when England ( later Great Britain ) conquered it , renaming it Jamaica . Under British colonial rule Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter , with a plantation economy dependent on the African slaves and later their descendants . The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838 , and many freedmen chose to have subsistence farms rather than to work on plantations . Beginning in the 1840s , the British began utilising Chinese and Indian indentured labour to work on plantations . The island achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 6 August 1962 .
