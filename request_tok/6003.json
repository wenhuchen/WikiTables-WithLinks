  "/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party": "The Democratic-Republican Party , better known at the time as the Republican Party and various other names , [ a ] was an American political party founded by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison in the early 1790s that championed republicanism , political equality , and expansionism . The party became increasingly dominant after the 1800 elections as the opposing Federalist Party collapsed . The Democratic-Republicans later splintered during the 1824 presidential election . One faction of the Democratic-Republicans eventually coalesced into the modern Democratic Party , while the other faction ultimately formed the core of the Whig Party . The Democratic-Republican Party originated as a faction in Congress that opposed the centralizing policies of Alexander Hamilton , who served as Secretary of the Treasury under President George Washington . The Democratic-Republicans and the opposing Federalist Party each became more cohesive during Washington 's second term , partly as a result of the debate over the Jay Treaty . Though he was defeated by Federalist John Adams in the 1796 presidential election , Jefferson and his Democratic-Republican allies came into power following the 1800 elections . As president , Jefferson presided over a reduction in the national debt and government spending , and completed the Louisiana Purchase with France . Madison succeeded Jefferson as president in 1809 and led the country during the largely-inconclusive War of 1812 with Britain . After the war , Madison and his congressional allies established the Second Bank of the United States and implemented protective tariffs , marking a move away from the party 's earlier emphasis on states ' rights and a strict construction of the United States Constitution . The Federalists collapsed after 1815 , beginning a period known as the Era of Good Feelings . Lacking an effective opposition , the Democratic-Republicans split into groups after the 1824 presidential election ; one faction supported President John Quincy Adams , while the other faction backed General Andrew Jackson .",
