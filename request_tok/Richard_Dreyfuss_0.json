  "/wiki/Jaws_(film)": "Jaws is a 1975 American thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg and based on Peter Benchley 's 1974 novel of the same name . In the film , a giant man-eating great white shark attacks beachgoers at a New England summer resort town , prompting police chief Martin Brody ( Roy Scheider ) to hunt it with the help of a marine biologist ( Richard Dreyfuss ) and a professional shark hunter ( Robert Shaw ) . Murray Hamilton plays the mayor , and Lorraine Gary portrays Brody 's wife . The screenplay is credited to Benchley , who wrote the first drafts , and actor-writer Carl Gottlieb , who rewrote the script during principal photography . Shot mostly on location on Martha 's Vineyard in Massachusetts , Jaws had a troubled production , going over budget and past schedule . As the art department 's mechanical sharks often malfunctioned , Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the shark 's presence , employing an ominous and minimalistic theme created by composer John Williams to indicate its impending appearances . Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of director Alfred Hitchcock . Universal Pictures gave the film what was then an exceptionally wide release for a major studio picture , on over 450 screens , accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign with a heavy emphasis on television spots and tie-in merchandise . Considered one of the greatest films ever made , Jaws was the prototypical summer blockbuster , regarded as a watershed moment in motion picture history , and it won several awards for its music and editing . It was the highest-grossing film until the release of Star Wars in 1977 . Both films were pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model , which pursues high box-office returns from action and adventure films with simple high-concept premises , released during the summer in thousands of theaters and heavily advertised . Jaws was followed by three sequels , all without Spielberg or Benchley , and many imitative thrillers .",
