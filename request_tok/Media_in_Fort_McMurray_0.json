  "/wiki/Country_music": "Country music , also known as country and western ( or simply country ) , and hillbilly music , is a genre of popular music that takes its roots from genres such as American folk music ( especially Appalachian and Western music ) and blues . Its popularized roots originate in the Southern United States of the early 1920s . Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms , folk lyrics , and harmonies mostly accompanied by string instruments such as banjos , electric and acoustic guitars , steel guitars ( such as pedal steels and dobros ) , and fiddles as well as harmonicas . Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history . According to Lindsey Starnes , the term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music ; it came to encompass Western music , which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots , in the mid-20th century . In 2009 in the United States , country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute , and second most popular in the morning commute . The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres . The origins of country music are found in the folk music of working class Americans and/or blue-collar American life , who blended popular songs , Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes , traditional English ballads , cowboy songs , and the musical traditions of various groups of European immigrants .",

  "/wiki/First_Nations": "In Canada , the First Nations ( French : Premi\u00e8res Nations [ p\u0281\u0259mj\u025b\u0281 n\u0251sj\u0254\u0303 ] ) are the predominant indigenous peoples in Canada south of the Arctic Circle . Those in the Arctic area are distinct and known as Inuit . The M\u00e9tis , another distinct ethnicity , developed after European contact and relations primarily between First Nations people and Europeans . There are 634 recognized First Nations governments or bands spread across Canada , roughly half of which are in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia . Under Charter Jurisprudence , First Nations are a designated group , along with women , visible minorities , and people with physical or mental disabilities . First Nations are not defined as a visible minority by the criteria of Statistics Canada . North American indigenous peoples have cultures spanning thousands of years . Some of their oral traditions accurately describe historical events , such as the Cascadia earthquake of 1700 and the 18th-century Tseax Cone eruption . Written records began with the arrival of European explorers and colonists during the Age of Discovery , beginning in the late 15th century . European accounts by trappers , traders , explorers , and missionaries give important evidence of early contact culture . In addition , archeological and anthropological research , as well as linguistics , have helped scholars piece together an understanding of ancient cultures and historic peoples . Although not without conflict , early Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cers ' , Acadians ' , and Newfoundlanders ' interactions with First Nations , M\u00e9tis , and Inuit populations were less combative compared to the often violent battles between colonists and native peoples in the United States .",

They are generally nonprofit and provide a mechanism for enabling individuals , groups , and communities to tell their own stories , to share experiences and , in a media-rich world , to become creators and contributors of media . In many parts of the world , community radio acts as a vehicle for the community and voluntary sector , civil society , agencies , NGOs and citizens to work in partnership to further community development aims , in addition to broadcasting . There is legally defined community radio ( as a distinct broadcasting sector ) in many countries , such as France , Argentina , South Africa , Australia and Ireland . Much of the legislation has included phrases such as social benefit , social objectives and social gain as part of the definition .

  "/wiki/Talk_radio": "Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues and consisting entirely or almost entirely of original spoken word content rather than outside music . Most shows are regularly hosted by a single individual , and often feature interviews with a number of different guests . Talk radio typically includes an element of listener participation , usually by broadcasting live conversations between the host and listeners who call in ( usually via telephone ) to the show . Listener contributions are usually screened by a show 's producers in order to maximize audience interest and , in the case of commercial talk radio , to attract advertisers . Generally , the shows are organized into segments , each separated by a pause for advertisements ; however , in public or non-commercial radio , music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments . Variations of talk radio include conservative talk , hot talk , liberal talk ( increasingly known as progressive talk ) and sports talk . While talk radio has historically been associated with broadcast radio , starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of live Internet website streaming and podcasts . Now , it is possible for an individual to use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station . In addition , TV programming from talk and news outlets such as BBC , CNN , Bloomberg and Fox is now often available expanding the world of talk radio further .

  "/wiki/Classic_hits": "Classic hits is a radio format which generally includes songs from the top 40 music charts from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s , with music from the 1980s serving as the core of the format . Music that was popularized by MTV in the early 1980s and the nostalgia behind it is a major driver to the format . It is considered the successor to the oldies format , a collection of top 40 songs from the late 1950s through the late 1970s that was once extremely popular in the United States . The term is sometimes incorrectly used as a synonym for the adult hits format , which uses a slightly newer music library stretching from all decades to the present with a major focus on 1990s and 2000s rock and alternative songs . In addition , adult hits stations tend to have larger playlists , playing a given song only a few times per week , compared to the tighter libraries on classic hits stations . For example , KRTH , a classic hits station in Los Angeles , plays power songs up to 30 times a week , which is another differentiator compared to other formats that share songs with classic hits libraries . The classic hits format has become extremely popular in the last few years with stations like KRTH , WCBS-FM in New York , and WLS-FM in Chicago having successful ratings with this model . Classic hits was named format of the summer of 2018 by Nielsen Audio 's research team emphasizing the huge popularity of the format . In addition , the Millennial generation is listening to this format in record numbers , according to a Nielsen report . As of December 2019 there are now over 1,100 classic hits stations in the United States , the largest amount in format history .",

  "/wiki/Hot_adult_contemporary": "In North American music , adult contemporary music ( AC ) is a form of radio-played popular music , ranging from 1960s vocal and 1970s soft rock music to predominantly ballad-heavy music of the present day , with varying degrees of easy listening , pop , soul , rhythm and blues , quiet storm , and rock influence . Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music . Adult contemporary tends to have lush , soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated . It is usually melodic enough to get a listener 's attention , and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music . Like most of pop music , its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse-chorus structure . The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments ( though bass guitar is usually used ) such as acoustic guitars , pianos , saxophones , and sometimes an orchestral set . The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched . However , recent adult contemporary music may feature synthesizers ( and other electronics , such as drum machines ) . An AC radio station may play mainstream music , but it excludes hip hop , dance tracks , hard rock , and some forms of teen pop , as these are less popular among adults , the target demographic . AC radio often targets the 25-44 age group , the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s . A common practice in recent years of adult contemporary stations is to play less newer music and more hits of the past . This de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart ."
