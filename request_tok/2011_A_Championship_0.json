Bohs are the third most successful club in League of Ireland football history , having won the League of Ireland title 11 times , the FAI Cup 7 times , the League of Ireland Shield 6 times and the League of Ireland Cup 3 times . Prior to the establishment of the Football Association of Ireland and League of Ireland , Bohemians competed in the Irish Football League and Irish Cup , which were at the time all-Ireland competitions . During that period they won the Irish Cup once and finished runners up 5 times . They share the record for most wins in European competition with archrivals Shamrock Rovers and hold the record for Leinster Senior Cup wins with 32 cups claimed . Bohemians were founded on 6 September 1890 in the Phoenix Park Gate Lodge beside the North Circular Road entrance and played its first games in the Park 's Polo Grounds . They were one of the founding members of the League of Ireland in 1921 , after their withdrawal from the Irish Football League . They established themselves as a major force within the first 15 years of the League of Ireland , winning 5 league titles , 2 FAI Cups and 4 Shields , but struggled for decades after that , largely due to their strict amateur status , going 34 seasons without winning a major trophy . Bohemians dropped their amateur ethos in 1969 and proceeded to win 2 League titles , 2 FAI Cups and 2 League cups during the 1970s . They suffered a further decline throughout the 1980s and most of the 1990s before claiming League and Cup doubles in 2001 and 2008 , alongside the 2003 and most recently 2009 title wins . Bohemians play their home matches at Dalymount park in the Northside neighbourhood of Phibsborough .",

Fanad encompasses the parishes of Clondavaddog , Killygarvan and parts of Tullyfern and Aughinish . It measures approximately 25 km north-south measured from Fanad Head to the town of Ramelton and approximately 12 km east-west measured between the townlands of Doaghbeg and Glinsk . The southern boundary of Fanad has been the subject of some dispute over the centuries . In the 16th century , during the time of the MacSuibhnes as rulers of Fanad , it was stated that the territory of Fanaid stretched as far south as the River Lennon between Kilmacrennan and Ramelton . In 1835 , the surveyor John O'Donovan referred to Rathmullan as the capital of Fanad , and he also refers to Clondavaddog as the most northern parish of Fanaid , suggesting that Fanad included parishes other than Clondavaddog . O'Donovan also noted that The inhabitants of Inishowen state that Fanaid extends from Rathmeltan to Mulroy Lough , but the natives of the Parishes of Killygarvan , Tully and Aughnish , who considered themselves civilised , deny that they themselves are of the men of Fanaid . It consists of small villages such as Tamney , Rossnakill and has a bordering village called Kerrykeel .
