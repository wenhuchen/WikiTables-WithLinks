  "/wiki/Gilgamesh": "Gilgamesh [ a ] was a historical king of the Sumerian city-state of Uruk , a major hero in ancient Mesopotamian mythology , and the protagonist of the Epic of Gilgamesh , an epic poem written in Akkadian during the late second millennium BC . He probably ruled sometime between 2800 and 2500 BC and was posthumously deified . He became a major figure in Sumerian legends during the Third Dynasty of Ur ( c. 2112 - c. 2004 BC ) . Tales of Gilgamesh 's legendary exploits are narrated in five surviving Sumerian poems . The earliest of these is probably Gilgamesh , Enkidu , and the Netherworld , in which Gilgamesh comes to the aid of the goddess Inanna and drives away the creatures infesting her huluppu tree . She gives him two unknown objects called a mikku and a pikku , which he loses . After Enkidu 's death , his shade tells Gilgamesh about the bleak conditions in the Underworld . The poem Gilgamesh and Agga describes Gilgamesh 's revolt against his overlord King Agga . Other Sumerian poems relate Gilgamesh 's defeat of the ogre Huwawa and the Bull of Heaven and a fifth , poorly preserved one apparently describes his death and funeral . In later Babylonian times , these stories began to be woven into a connected narrative . The standard Akkadian Epic of Gilgamesh was composed by a scribe named S\u00een-l\u0113qi-unninni , probably during the Middle Babylonian Period ( c. 1600 - c. 1155 BC ) , based on much older source material . In the epic , Gilgamesh is a demigod of superhuman strength who befriends the wildman Enkidu .",
  "/wiki/Uruk": "Uruk was an ancient city of Sumer ( and later of Babylonia ) , situated east of the present bed of the Euphrates river , on the dried-up , ancient channel of the Euphrates , some 30 km ( 19 mi ) east of modern Samawah , Al-Muthann\u0101 , Iraq . Uruk is the type site for the Uruk period . Uruk played a leading role in the early urbanization of Sumer in the mid-4th millennium BC . At its height c. 2900 BC , Uruk probably had 50,000-80,000 residents living in 6 km2 ( 2.32 sq mi ) of walled area ; making it the largest city in the world at the time . The legendary king Gilgamesh , according to the chronology presented in the Sumerian king list , ruled Uruk in the 27th century BC . The city lost its prime importance around 2000 BC , in the context of the struggle of Babylonia against Elam , but it remained inhabited throughout the Seleucid ( 312-63 BC ) and Parthian ( 227 BC to 224 AD ) periods until it was finally abandoned shortly before or after the Islamic conquest of 633-638 . William Kennett Loftus visited the site of Uruk in 1849 and led the first excavations from 1850 to 1854 ; he had identified it as Erech , known as the second city of Nimrod . The Arabic name of Babylonia , which eventually became the name of the present-day country , al-\u02bfIr\u0101q , is thought to derive from the name Uruk , via Aramaic ( Erech ) and possibly via Middle Persian ( Er\u0101q ) transmission . In Sumerian the word uru could mean city , town , village , district .",
  "/wiki/Early_Dynastic_Period_(Mesopotamia)": "The Early Dynastic period ( abbreviated ED period or ED ) is an archaeological culture in Mesopotamia ( modern-day Iraq ) that is generally dated to c. 2900-2350 BC and was preceded by the Uruk and Jemdet Nasr periods . It is part of the history of Mesopotamia . It saw the development of writing and the formation of the first cities and states . The ED itself was characterized by the existence of multiple city-states : small states with a relatively simple structure that developed and solidified over time . This development ultimately led to the unification of much of Mesopotamia under the rule of Sargon , the first monarch of the Akkadian Empire . Despite this political fragmentation , the ED city-states shared a relatively homogeneous material culture . Sumerian cities such as Uruk , Ur , Lagash , Umma , and Nippur located in Lower Mesopotamia were very powerful and influential . To the north and west stretched states centered on cities such as Kish , Mari , Nagar , and Ebla . The study of Central and Lower Mesopotamia has long been given priority over neighboring regions . Archaeological sites in Central and Lower Mesopotamia - notably Girsu but also Eshnunna , Khafajah , Ur , and many others - have been excavated since the 1800s . These excavations have yielded cuneiform texts and many other important artifacts . As a result , this area was better known than neighboring regions , but the excavation and publication of the archives of Ebla have changed this perspective by shedding more light on surrounding areas , such as Upper Mesopotamia , western Syria , and southwestern Iran .",

  "/wiki/Kassites": "The Kassites ( /\u02c8k\u00e6sa\u026ats/ ) were people of the ancient Near East , who controlled Babylonia after the fall of the Old Babylonian Empire c. 1531 BC and until c. 1155 BC ( short chronology ) . The endonym of the Kassites was probably Galzu , although they have also been referred to by the names Ka\u0161\u0161u , Kassi , Kasi or Kashi . They gained control of Babylonia after the Hittite sack of the city in 1595 BC ( i.e . 1531 BC per the short chronology ) , and established a dynasty based first in Babylon and later in Dur-Kurigalzu . The Kassites were members of a small military aristocracy but were efficient rulers and not locally unpopular , and their 500-year reign laid an essential groundwork for the development of subsequent Babylonian culture . The chariot and the horse , which the Kassites worshipped , first came into use in Babylonia at this time . The Kassite language has not been classified . What is known is that their language was not related to either the Indo-European language group , nor to Semitic or other Afro-Asiatic languages , and is most likely to have been a language isolate although some linguists have proposed a link to the Hurro-Urartian languages of Asia Minor . However , the arrival of the Kassites has been connected to the contemporary migrations of Indo-European peoples . Several Kassite leaders and deities bore Indo-European names , and it is possible that they were dominated by an Indo-European elite similar to the Mitanni , who ruled over the Hurro-Urartian-speaking Hurrians of Asia Minor .",

In literary circles , however , he is remembered for having compiled the best-preserved version of the Epic of Gilgamesh . His name is listed in the text itself , which was unorthodox for works written in cuneiform . His version is known by its incipit , or first line Sha naqba \u012bmuru ( He who saw the deep or The one who saw the Abyss ) . The extent to which his version is different from earlier texts is unknown ; Andrew R. George argues that S\u00een-l\u0113qi-unninni gave [ The Epic of Gilgamesh ] its final , fixed form . The prologue features the only instance of first person narration by S\u00een-l\u0113qi-unninni . His version includes Utnapishtim 's story of the Flood in tablet XI and , in tablet XII , the Sumerian Gilgamesh , Enkidu and the Netherworld . S\u00een-l\u0113qi-unninni 's name means 'S\u00een ( the Moon God ) is one who accepts my prayer ' .

  "/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh": "The Epic of Gilgamesh ( /\u02c8\u0261\u026al\u0261\u0259m\u025b\u0283/ ) is an epic poem from ancient Mesopotamia that is often regarded as the earliest surviving great work of literature and the second oldest religious text , after the Pyramid Texts . The literary history of Gilgamesh begins with five Sumerian poems about Bilgamesh ( Sumerian for Gilgamesh ) , king of Uruk , dating from the Third Dynasty of Ur ( c. 2100 BC ) . These independent stories were later used as source material for a combined epic in Akkadian . The first surviving version of this combined epic , known as the Old Babylonian version dates to the 18th century BC and is titled after its incipit , Sh\u016btur eli sharr\u012b ( Surpassing All Other Kings ) . Only a few tablets of it have survived . The later standard version compiled by S\u00een-l\u0113qi-unninni dates from the 13th to the 10th centuries BC and bears the incipit Sha naqba \u012bmuru ( He who Saw the Abyss , in modern terms : He who Sees the Unknown ) . Approximately two thirds of this longer , twelve-tablet version have been recovered . Some of the best copies were discovered in the library ruins of the 7th-century BC Assyrian king Ashurbanipal . The first half of the story discusses Gilgamesh , king of Uruk , and Enkidu , a wild man created by the gods to stop Gilgamesh from oppressing the people of Uruk . After Enkidu becomes civilized through sexual initiation with a prostitute , he travels to Uruk , where he challenges Gilgamesh to a test of strength . Gilgamesh wins the contest ; nonetheless , the two become friends . Together , they make a six-day journey to the legendary Cedar Forest , where they plan to slay the Guardian , Humbaba the Terrible , and cut down the sacred Cedar .",
  "/wiki/Epic_poem": "An epic poem , epic , epos , or epopee is a lengthy narrative poem , ordinarily involving a time beyond living memory in which occurred the extraordinary doings of the extraordinary men and women who , in dealings with the gods or other superhuman forces , gave shape to the moral universe for their descendants , the poet and his audience , to understand themselves as a people or nation . Another type of epic poetry is epyllion ( plural : epyllia ) , which is a brief narrative poem with a romantic or mythological theme . The term , which means little epic , came into use in the nineteenth century . It refers primarily to the erudite , shorter hexameter poems of the Hellenistic period and the similar works composed at Rome from the age of the neoterics ; to a lesser degree , the term includes some poems of the English Renaissance , particularly those influenced by Ovid . The most famous example of classical epyllion is perhaps Catullus 64 .",

It is the earliest attested Semitic language . It used the cuneiform script , which was originally used to write the unrelated , and also extinct , Sumerian ( which is a language isolate ) . Akkadian is named after the city of Akkad , a major centre of Mesopotamian civilization during the Akkadian Empire ( c. 2334-2154 BC ) . The mutual influence between Sumerian and Akkadian had led scholars to describe the languages as a Sprachbund . Akkadian proper names were first attested in Sumerian texts from around the mid 3rd-millennium BC . From about the 25th or 24th century BC , texts fully written in Akkadian begin to appear . By the 10th century BC , two variant forms of the language were in use in Assyria and Babylonia , known as Assyrian and Babylonian respectively . The bulk of preserved material is from this later period , corresponding to the Near Eastern Iron Age . In total , hundreds of thousands of texts and text fragments have been excavated , covering a vast textual tradition of mythological narrative , legal texts , scientific works , correspondence , political and military events , and many other examples . Akkadian ( in its Assyrian and Babylonian varieties ) was the native language of the Mesopotamian empires ( Akkadian Empire , Old Assyrian Empire , Babylonia , Middle Assyrian Empire ) throughout the later Bronze Age , and Akkadian became the lingua franca of much of the Ancient Near East by the time of the Bronze Age collapse . Its decline began duing the Iron Age , during the Neo-Assyrian Empire , by about the 8th century BC ( Tiglath-Pileser III ) , in favour of Old Aramaic .",

Traditions from long after Imhotep 's death treated him as a great author of wisdom texts and especially as a physician . No text from his lifetime mentions these capacities and no text mentions his name in the first 1200 years following his death . Apart from the three short contemporary inscriptions that establish him as chancellor to the pharaoh , the first text to reference Imhotep dates to the time of Amenhotep III ( c. 1391-1353 BC ) .

  "/wiki/Ancient_Egypt": "Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient North Africa , concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River , situated in the place that is now the country Egypt . Ancient Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3100 BC ( according to conventional Egyptian chronology ) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes ( often identified with Narmer ) . The history of ancient Egypt occurred as a series of stable kingdoms , separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods : the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age , the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age . Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power in the New Kingdom , ruling much of Nubia and a sizable portion of the Near East , after which it entered a period of slow decline . During the course of its history Egypt was invaded or conquered by a number of foreign powers , including the Hyksos , the Libyans , the Nubians , the Assyrians , the Achaemenid Persians , and the Macedonians under the command of Alexander the Great . The Greek Ptolemaic Kingdom , formed in the aftermath of Alexander 's death , ruled Egypt until 30 BC , when , under Cleopatra , it fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman province . The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River valley for agriculture . The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops , which supported a more dense population , and social development and culture . With resources to spare , the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions , the early development of an independent writing system , the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects , trade with surrounding regions , and a military intended to assert Egyptian dominance . Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes , religious leaders , and administrators under the control of a pharaoh , who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs . The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying , surveying and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids , temples , and obelisks ; a system of mathematics , a practical and effective system of medicine , irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques , the first known planked boats , Egyptian faience and glass technology , new forms of literature , and the earliest known peace treaty , made with the Hittites .

  "/wiki/Carthage": "Carthage was the center or capital city of the ancient Carthaginian civilization , on the eastern side of the Lake of Tunis in what is now the Tunis Governorate in Tunisia . Carthage was widely considered the most important trading hub of the Ancient Mediterranean and was arguably one of the most affluent cities of the Ancient World . The city developed from a Phoenician colony into the capital of a Punic empire which dominated large parts of the Southwest Mediterranean during the first millennium BC . The legendary Queen Alyssa or Dido is regarded as the founder of the city , though her historicity has been questioned . According to accounts by Timaeus of Tauromenium , she purchased from a local tribe the amount of land that could be covered by an oxhide . Cutting the skin into strips , she laid out her claim and founded an empire that would become , through the Punic Wars , the only existential threat to Rome until the coming of the Vandals several centuries later . The ancient city was destroyed by the Roman Republic in the Third Punic War in 146 BC and then re-developed as Roman Carthage , which became the major city of the Roman Empire in the province of Africa . The city was sacked and destroyed by Umayyad forces after the Battle of Carthage in 698 to prevent it from being reconquered by the Byzantine Empire . It remained occupied during the Muslim period and was used as a fort by the Muslims until the Hafsid period when it was taken by the Crusaders with its inhabitants massacred during the Eighth Crusade . The Hafsids decided to destroy its defenses so it could n't be used as a base by a hostile power again . It also continued to function as an episcopal see . The regional power had shifted to Kairouan and the Medina of Tunis in the medieval period , until the early 20th century , when it began to develop into a coastal suburb of Tunis , incorporated as Carthage municipality in 1919 .",

The name appears to have originated in Carthage ( modern day Tunisia ) , though it does not appear in local theophorous names . She was equivalent to the moon-goddess Astarte , and later worshipped in Roman Carthage in her Romanized form as Dea Caelestis , Juno Caelestis , or simply Caelestis . In modern-day Tunisian Arabic , it is customary to invoke Omek Tannou or Oumouk Tangou ( 'Mother Tannou ' or 'Mother Tangou ' , depending on the region ) , in years of drought to bring rain .

The Iliad is set during the Trojan War , the ten-year siege of the city of Troy by a coalition of Greek kingdoms . It focuses on a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles lasting a few weeks during the last year of the war . The Odyssey focuses on the ten-year journey home of Odysseus , king of Ithaca , after the fall of Troy . Many accounts of Homer 's life circulated in classical antiquity , the most widespread being that he was a blind bard from Ionia , a region of central coastal Anatolia in present-day Turkey . Modern scholars consider these accounts legendary . The Homeric Question - concerning by whom , when , where and under what circumstances the Iliad and Odyssey were composed - continues to be debated . Broadly speaking , modern scholarly opinion falls into two groups . One holds that most of the Iliad and ( according to some ) the Odyssey are the works of a single poet of genius . The other considers the Homeric poems to be the result of a process of working and reworking by many contributors , and that Homer is best seen as a label for an entire tradition . It is generally accepted that the poems were composed at some point around the late eighth or early seventh century BC . The poems are in Homeric Greek , also known as Epic Greek , a literary language which shows a mixture of features of the Ionic and Aeolic dialects from different centuries ; the predominant influence is Eastern Ionic .",

The city extends about 40 km ( 25 mi ) at the northern coast of Egypt along the Mediterranean Sea . Alexandria is a popular tourist destination , and also an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez . Alexandria was founded in c. 331 BC by Alexander the Great , king of Macedon and leader of the Greek League of Corinth , during his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire . An Egyptian village named Rhacotis existed at the location and grew into the Egyptian quarter of Alexandria . Alexandria grew rapidly to become an important center of Hellenistic civilization and remained the capital of Ptolemaic Egypt and Roman and Byzantine Egypt for almost 1,000 years , until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in AD 641 , when a new capital was founded at Fustat ( later absorbed into Cairo ) . Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria ( Pharos ) , one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World ; its Great Library ( the largest in the ancient world ) ; and the Necropolis , one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages . Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural center of the ancient Mediterranean world for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity . It was at one time the largest city in the ancient world before being eventually overtaken by Rome . The city was a major center of early Christianity and was the center of the Patriarchate of Alexandria , which was one of the major centers of Christianity in the Eastern Roman Empire . In the modern world , the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage .",

Under the influence of Greek culture , Mars was identified with the Greek god Ares , whose myths were reinterpreted in Roman literature and art under the name of Mars . But the character and dignity of Mars differed in fundamental ways from that of his Greek counterpart , who is often treated with contempt and revulsion in Greek literature . Mars was a part of the Archaic Triad along with Jupiter and Quirinus , the latter of whom , as a guardian of the Roman people , had no Greek equivalent . Mars ' altar in the Campus Martius , the area of Rome that took its name from him , was supposed to have been dedicated by Numa , the peace-loving semi-legendary second king of Rome . Although the center of Mars ' worship was originally located outside the sacred boundary of Rome ( pomerium ) , Augustus made the god a renewed focus of Roman religion by establishing the Temple of Mars Ultor in his new forum . Although Ares was viewed primarily as a destructive and destabilizing force , Mars represented military power as a way to secure peace , and was a father ( pater ) of the Roman people . In the mythic genealogy and founding myths of Rome , Mars was the father of Romulus and Remus with Rhea Silvia . His love affair with Venus symbolically reconciled the two different traditions of Rome 's founding ; Venus was the divine mother of the hero Aeneas , celebrated as the Trojan refugee who founded Rome several generations before Romulus laid out the city walls . The importance of Mars in establishing religious and cultural identity within the Roman Empire is indicated by the vast number of inscriptions identifying him with a local deity , particularly in the Western provinces .",

This segmentation of resurrection into resurrect + ion was possible because English had examples of Latinate words in the form of verb and verb+-ion pairs , such as opine/opinion . These became the pattern for many more such pairs , where a verb derived from a Latin supine stem and a noun ending in ion entered the language together , such as insert/insertion , project/projection , etc .",

  "/wiki/Pythagoras": "Pythagoras of Samos [ a ] ( c. 570 - c. 495 BC ) [ b ] was an ancient Ionian Greek philosopher and the eponymous founder of Pythagoreanism . His political and religious teachings were well known in Magna Graecia and influenced the philosophies of Plato , Aristotle , and , through them , Western philosophy . Knowledge of his life is clouded by legend , but he appears to have been the son of Mnesarchus , a gem-engraver on the island of Samos . Modern scholars disagree regarding Pythagoras 's education and influences , but they do agree that , around 530 BC , he travelled to Croton , in what is now southern Italy , where he founded a school in which initiates were sworn to secrecy and lived a communal , ascetic lifestyle . This lifestyle entailed a number of dietary prohibitions , traditionally said to have included vegetarianism , although modern scholars doubt that he ever advocated for complete vegetarianism . The teaching most securely identified with Pythagoras is metempsychosis , or the transmigration of souls , which holds that every soul is immortal and , upon death , enters into a new body . He may have also devised the doctrine of musica universalis , which holds that the planets move according to mathematical equations and thus resonate to produce an inaudible symphony of music . Scholars debate whether Pythagoras developed the numerological and musical teachings attributed to him , or if those teachings were developed by his later followers , particularly Philolaus of Croton . Following Croton 's decisive victory over Sybaris in around 510 BC , Pythagoras 's followers came into conflict with supporters of democracy and Pythagorean meeting houses were burned . Pythagoras may have been killed during this persecution , or escaped to Metapontum , where he eventually died . In antiquity , Pythagoras was credited with many mathematical and scientific discoveries , including the Pythagorean theorem , Pythagorean tuning , the five regular solids , the Theory of Proportions , the sphericity of the Earth , and the identity of the morning and evening stars as the planet Venus . It was said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher ( lover of wisdom ) [ c ] and that he was the first to divide the globe into five climatic zones .",
  "/wiki/Pythagoreanism": "Pythagoreanism originated in the 6th century BC , based on the teachings and beliefs held by Pythagoras and his followers , the Pythagoreans . Pythagoras established the first Pythagorean community in Crotone , Italy . Early Pythagorean communities spread throughout Magna Graecia . Pythagoras death and disputes about his teachings led to the development of two philosophical traditions within Pythagoreanism . The akousmatikoi were superseded in the 4th century BC as a significant mendicant school of philosophy by the Cynics . The math\u0113matikoi philosophers were absorbed into the Platonic school in the 4th century BC . Following the political instability in the Magna Graecia , some Pythagorean philosophers fled to mainland Greece while others regrouped in Rhegium . By about 400 BC the majority of Pythagorean philosophers had left Italy . Pythagorean ideas exercised a marked influence on Plato and through him , on all of Western philosophy . Many of the surviving sources on Pythagoras originate with Aristotle and the philosophers of the Peripatetic school . As a philosophic tradition , Pythagoreanism was revived in the 1st century BC , giving rise to Neopythagoreanism .

  "/wiki/History_of_early_Christianity": "Early Christianity is a period in the history of Christianity , generally reckoned by church historians to begin with the ministry of Jesus ( c. 27-30 ) and end with the First Council of Nicaea ( 325 ) . It is typically divided into two periods : Christianity in the 1st century which is known as the Apostolic Age ( c. 30-100 ) and the Ante-Nicene Period ( c. 100-325 ) . Christians in the Roman Empire were persecuted until Emperor Constantine I 's toleration and promotion of Christianity . The earliest followers of Jesus were an apocalyptic , Second Temple Jewish sect of Jewish Christians in the Roman province of Judea . Throughout the 2nd and 3rd century , Christianity spread to various settlements in around the Mediterranean Basin , Southern Europe , North Africa , Anatolia , and in the east reached the Caspian Sea . A variety of strains developed in , for example , Alexandria , Antioch , Judea , and Rome . One strain , later known as Pauline Christianity , included Gentiles ( non-Jews ) and God-fearers ( non-Jews who partially adopted Hellenistic Judaism ) and departed from Jewish Christianity and Jewish customs ( a decision affirmed in the Council of Jerusalem c. 50 ) . This proto-orthodox Christianity gradually became an independent religion , evolving into the dominant strain of Christianity which condemned other early Christian sects and Jewish Christians as heretics . As proto-orthodox bishops across the Roman and Persian Empires assembled into an organized network , around 180 they began referring to the it as the Great Church . The First Council of Nicaea refined the doctrine of the Great Church , but splinter groups of Gentile Christianity such as Arian Christianity continued to exist as did Jewish Christian groups who continued to follow the Law of Moses . In 380 , the remaining mainstream of Nicene Christianity would become the official religion of the Roman Empire .

Christian orthodoxy , which is rooted in the first centuries of Christian history , relies heavily on these teachings , and considers them to be amplifications and explanations of the teachings of Jesus .

  "/wiki/Pauline_epistles": "The Pauline epistles , also called Epistles of Paul or Letters of Paul , are the thirteen books of the New Testament attributed to Paul the Apostle , although the authorship of some is in dispute . Among these letters are some of the earliest extant Christian documents . They provide an insight into the beliefs and controversies of early Christianity . As part of the canon of the New Testament , they are foundational texts for both Christian theology and ethics . The Epistle to the Hebrews , although it does not bear his name , was traditionally considered Pauline ( although Origen questioned its authorship in the 3rd century C.E . ) , but from the 16th century onwards opinion steadily moved against Pauline authorship and few scholars now ascribe it to Paul , mostly because it does not read like any of his other epistles in style and content . Most scholars agree that Paul actually wrote seven of the Pauline epistles , but that four of the epistles in Paul 's name are pseudepigraphic ( Ephesians , First Timothy , Second Timothy , and Titus ) and that two other epistles are of questionable authorship ( Second Thessalonians and Colossians ) . According to some scholars , Paul wrote these letters with the help of a secretary , or amanuensis , who would have influenced their style , if not their theological content . The Pauline epistles are usually placed between the Acts of the Apostles and the general epistles in modern editions . Most Greek manuscripts , however , place the General epistles first , and a few minuscules ( 175 , 325 , 336 , and 1424 ) place the Pauline epistles at the end of the New Testament .",
  "/wiki/Son_of_God": "Historically , many rulers have assumed titles such as son of God , son of a god or son of heaven . The term son of God is sometimes used in the Old and New Testaments of the Christian Bible to refer to those with special relationships with God . In the Old Testament , angels , just and pious men , and the kings of Israel are all called sons of God . In the New Testament , notably , Jesus Christ is called son of God , while followers of Jesus are called , sons of God . In the New Testament , Son of God is applied to Jesus on many occasions . Jesus is declared to be the Son of God on two separate occasions by a voice speaking from Heaven . Jesus is also explicitly and implicitly described as the Son of God by himself and by various individuals who appear in the New Testament . As applied to Jesus , the term is a reference to his role as the Messiah , the King chosen by God . The contexts and ways in which Jesus ' title , Son of God , means something more than or other than Messiah remain the subject of ongoing scholarly study and discussion . The term Son of God should not be confused with the term God the Son ( Greek : \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 \u1f41 \u03c5\u1f31\u03cc\u03c2 ) , the second Person of the Trinity in Christian theology . The doctrine of the Trinity identifies Jesus as God the Son , identical in essence but distinct in person with regard to God the Father and God the Holy Spirit ( the first and third Persons of the Trinity ) . Nontrinitarian Christians accept the application to Jesus of the term Son of God , which is found in the New Testament",

This ecumenical council was the first effort to attain consensus in the church through an assembly representing all of Christendom . Hosius of Corduba , who was probably one of the papal legates , may have presided over its deliberations . Its main accomplishments were settlement of the Christological issue of the divine nature of God the Son and his relationship to God the Father , the construction of the first part of the Nicene Creed , establishing uniform observance of the date of Easter , and promulgation of early canon law .",

It is called Nicene /\u02c8na\u026asi\u02d0n/ because it was originally adopted in the city of Nicaea ( present day \u0130znik , Turkey ) by the First Council of Nicaea in 325 . In 381 , it was amended at the First Council of Constantinople , and the amended form is referred to as the Nicene or the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed . It defines Nicene Christianity . The Oriental Orthodox and Assyrian churches use this profession of faith with the verbs in the original plural ( we believe ) , but the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic churches convert those verbs to the singular ( I believe ) . The Anglican and many Protestant denominations generally use the singular form , sometimes the plural . The Apostles ' Creed is also used in the Latin West , but not in the Eastern liturgies . On Sundays and solemnities , one of these two creeds is recited in the Roman Rite Mass after the homily . The Nicene Creed is also part of the profession of faith required of those undertaking important functions within the Catholic Church .

  "/wiki/Incarnation_(Christianity)": "In Christian theology , the incarnation is the belief that Jesus Christ , the second person of the Trinity , also known as God the Son or the Logos ( Koine Greek for Word ) , was made flesh by being conceived in the womb of a woman , the Virgin Mary , also known as the Theotokos ( Greek for God-bearer ) . The doctrine of the incarnation , then , entails that Jesus is fully God and fully human . In the incarnation , as traditionally defined by those Churches that adhere to the Council of Chalcedon , the divine nature of the Son was united but not mixed with human nature in one divine Person , Jesus Christ , who was both truly God and truly man . This is central to the traditional faith held by most Christians . Alternative views on the subject ( see Ebionites and the Gospel of the Hebrews ) have been proposed throughout the centuries , but all were rejected by mainstream Christian bodies . The incarnation is commemorated and celebrated each year at Christmas , and also reference can be made to the Feast of the Annunciation ; different aspects of the mystery of the incarnation are celebrated at Christmas and the Annunciation .",
  "/wiki/Ebionites": "Ebionites is a patristic term referring to a Jewish Christian movement that existed during the early centuries of the Christian Era . They regarded Jesus of Nazareth as the Messiah while rejecting his divinity and his virgin birth and insisted on the necessity of following Jewish law and rites . They used only one of the Jewish-Christian gospels , the Hebrew Book of Matthew starting at chapter three ; revered James , the brother of Jesus ( James the Just ) ; and rejected Paul the Apostle as an apostate from the Law . Their name suggests that they placed a special value on voluntary poverty . Ebionim was one of the terms used by the sect at Qumran who sought to separate themselves from the corruption of the Temple . Many believe that the Qumran sectarians were Essenes . Since historical records by the Ebionites are scarce , fragmentary and disputed , much of what is known or conjectured about the Ebionites derives from the Church Fathers who wrote polemics against the Ebionites , who they deemed heretical Judaizers . Consequently , very little about the Ebionite sect or sects is known with certainty , and most , if not all , statements about them are conjectural . At least one scholar distinguishes the Ebionites from other Jewish Christian groups , such as the Nazarenes . Other scholars , like the Church Fathers themselves from the first centuries after Jesus , consider the Ebionites identical with the Nazarenes .",
  "/wiki/Jesus_in_Christianity": "In Christianity , Jesus is believed to be the Son of God and in many mainstream denominations the second Person of the Trinity . Christians believe that through his crucifixion and subsequent resurrection , God offered humans salvation and eternal life . He is believed to be the Jewish messiah prophesied in the Hebrew Bible , called the Old Testament in Christianity . These teachings emphasize that as the Lamb of God , Jesus chose to suffer on the cross at Calvary as a sign of his obedience to the will of God , as an agent and servant of God . Jesus died to atone for sin to make humanity right with God . Jesus ' choice positions him as a man of obedience , in contrast to Adam 's disobedience . Christians believe that Jesus was both human and divine - the Son of God . While there has been theological debate over the nature of Jesus , Trinitarian Christians believe that Jesus is the Logos , God incarnate , God the Son , and true God and true man - both fully divine and fully human . Jesus , having become fully human in all respects , suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man , yet he did not sin . According to the Bible , God raised him from the dead .

He was deified after his death , being worshipped in both the Greek East and Latin West , sometimes as a god ( theos ) and sometimes merely as a hero ( heros ) . Little is known of Antinous 's life , although it is known that he was born in Claudiopolis ( present day Bolu , Turkey ) , in the Roman province of Bithynia . He was probably introduced to Hadrian in 123 , before being taken to Italy for a higher education . He had become the favourite of Hadrian by 128 , when he was taken on a tour of the Empire as part of Hadrian 's personal retinue . Antinous accompanied Hadrian during his attendance of the annual Eleusinian Mysteries in Athens , and was with him when he killed the Marousian lion in Libya . In October 130 , as they were part of a flotilla going along the Nile , Antinous died amid mysterious circumstances . Various suggestions have been put forward for how he died , ranging from an accidental drowning to an intentional human sacrifice or suicide . Following his death , Hadrian deified Antinous and founded an organised cult devoted to his worship that spread throughout the Empire . Hadrian founded the city of Antino\u00f6polis close to Antinous 's place of death , which became a cultic centre for the worship of Osiris-Antinous . Hadrian also founded games in commemoration of Antinous to take place in both Antino\u00f6polis and Athens , with Antinous becoming a symbol of Hadrian 's dreams of pan-Hellenism . The worship of Antinous proved to be one of the most enduring and popular of cults of deified humans in the Roman empire , and events continued to be founded in his honor long after Hadrian 's death .",

[ note 1 ] He was born Publius Aelius Hadrianus in Italica , Hispania Baetica , into a Roman Italo-Hispanic family that settled in Spain from the Italian city of Atri in Picenum . His father was of senatorial rank and was a first cousin of Emperor Trajan . He married Trajan 's grand-niece Vibia Sabina early in his career , before Trajan became emperor and possibly at the behest of Trajan 's wife Pompeia Plotina . Plotina and Trajan 's close friend and adviser Lucius Licinius Sura were well disposed towards Hadrian . When Trajan died , his widow claimed that he had nominated Hadrian as emperor immediately before his death . Rome 's military and Senate approved Hadrian 's succession , but four leading senators were unlawfully put to death soon after . They had opposed Hadrian or seemed to threaten his succession , and the senate held him responsible for it and never forgave him . He earned further disapproval among the elite by abandoning Trajan 's expansionist policies and territorial gains in Mesopotamia , Assyria , Armenia , and parts of Dacia . Hadrian preferred to invest in the development of stable , defensible borders and the unification of the empire 's disparate peoples .

  "/wiki/Mary,_mother_of_Jesus": "Mary [ c ] was a first-century BC Galilean Jewish woman of Nazareth , and the mother of Jesus , according to the New Testament and the Quran . The gospels of Matthew and Luke in the New Testament and the Quran describe Mary as a virgin . In Matthew and Luke she is betrothed to Joseph . According to Christian theology she conceived Jesus through the Holy Spirit while still a virgin . She accompanied Joseph to Bethlehem , where Jesus was born . According to Catholic and Eastern Christian teachings , at the end of her earthly life her body was raised directly into Heaven ; this is known in the Christian West as the Assumption . Mary has been venerated since early Christianity , and is considered by millions to be the most meritorious saint of the religion . She is said to have miraculously appeared to believers many times over the centuries . The Eastern and Oriental Orthodox , Catholic , Anglican , and Lutheran churches believe that Mary , as mother of Jesus , is the Theotokos ( Mother of God ) ( Greek : \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03c4\u03cc\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 , romanized : Theotokos , lit .

  "/wiki/Mother_Goddess": "A mother goddess is a goddess who represents , or is a personification of nature , motherhood , fertility , creation , destruction or who embodies the bounty of the Earth . When equated with the Earth or the natural world , such goddesses are sometimes referred to as Mother Earth or as the Earth Mother . The concept is complementary to a sky father . There is difference of opinion between the academic and the popular conception of the term . The popular view is mainly driven by the Goddess movement and reads that primitive societies initially were matriarchal , worshipping a sovereign , nurturing , motherly earth goddess . This was based upon the nineteenth-century ideas of unilineal evolution of Johann Jakob Bachofen . According to the academic view , however , both Bachofen and the modern Goddess theories are a projection of contemporary world views on ancient myths , rather than attempting to understand the mentalit\u00e9 of that time . Often this is accompanied by a desire for a lost civilization from a bygone era that would have been just , peaceful and wise . However , it is highly unlikely that such a civilization ever existed . For a long time , feminist authors advocated that these peaceful , matriarchal agrarian societies were exterminated or subjugated by nomadic , patriarchal warrior tribes . An important contribution to this was that of archaeologist Marija Gimbutas . Her work in this field has been questioned .",
  "/wiki/Collyridianism": "Collyridianism ( or Kollyridianism ) was an alleged Early Christian heretical movement in pre-Islamic Arabia , whose adherents apparently worshipped the Virgin Mary , mother of Jesus , as a goddess . The existence of the sect is subject to some dispute by scholars , as the only contemporary source which describes them is the Panarion of Epiphanius of Salamis , published in approximately 376 AD . According to Epiphanius , certain women in then-largely-pagan Arabia syncretized indigenous beliefs with the worship of Mary , and offered little cakes or bread-rolls . These cakes were called collyris ( Greek : \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 ) , and are the source of the name Collyridians . Epiphanius states that Collyridianism originated in Thrace and Scythia , although it may have first travelled to those regions from Syria or Asia Minor . Theologian Karl Gerok disputed the existence of the Collyridians , describing it as improbable that a sect composed only of women could have lasted for as long as Epiphanius describes . Protestant writer Samuel Zwemer pointed out that the only source of information about the sect came from Epiphanius . In his 1976 book The Virgin , historian Geoffrey Ashe puts forward the hypothesis that the Collyridians represented a parallel Marian religion to Christianity , founded by first-generation followers of the Virgin Mary , whose doctrines were later subsumed by the Church at the Council of Ephesus in 431 . Historian Averil Cameron has been more sceptical about whether the movement even existed , noting that Epiphanius is the only source for the group , and that later authors simply refer back to his text .",

He is considered a saint and a Church Father by both the Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches . He gained a reputation as a strong defender of orthodoxy . He is best known for composing the Panarion , a very large compendium of the heresies up to his own time , full of quotations that are often the only surviving fragments of suppressed texts . According to Ernst Kitzinger , he seems to have been the first cleric to have taken up the matter of Christian religious images as a major issue , and there has been much controversy over how many of the quotations attributed to him by the Byzantine Iconoclasts were actually by him .

Along with Zhang Fei , he shared a brotherly relationship with Liu Bei and accompanied him on most of his early exploits . Guan Yu played a significant role in the events leading up to the end of the Han dynasty and the establishment of Liu Bei 's state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period . While he is remembered for his loyalty towards Liu Bei , he is also known for repaying Cao Cao 's kindness by slaying Yan Liang , a general under Cao Cao 's rival Yuan Shao , at the Battle of Boma . After Liu Bei gained control of Yi Province in 214 , Guan Yu remained in Jing Province to govern and defend the area for about seven years . In 219 , while he was away fighting Cao Cao 's forces at the Battle of Fancheng , Liu Bei 's ally Sun Quan broke the Sun-Liu alliance and sent his general L\u00fc Meng to conquer Liu Bei 's territories in Jing Province . By the time Guan Yu found out about the loss of Jing Province after his defeat at Fancheng , it was too late . He was subsequently captured in an ambush by Sun Quan 's forces and executed . Guan Yu 's life was lionised and his achievements glorified to such an extent after his death that he was deified during the Sui dynasty . Through generations of story telling , culminating in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms , his deeds and moral qualities have been given immense emphasis , making Guan Yu one of East Asia 's most popular paradigms of loyalty and righteousness .

  "/wiki/Sui_Dynasty": "The Sui dynasty ( Chinese : \u968b\u671d ; pinyin : Su\u00ed ch\u00e1o ) was a short-lived imperial dynasty of China of pivotal significance . The Sui unified the Northern and Southern dynasties and reinstalled the rule of ethnic Chinese in the entirety of China proper , along with sinicization of former nomadic ethnic minorities ( Five Barbarians ) within its territory . It was succeeded by the Tang dynasty , which largely inherited its foundation . Founded by Emperor Wen of Sui , the Sui dynasty capital was Chang'an ( which was renamed Daxing , 581-605 ) and later Luoyang ( 605-618 ) . Emperors Wen and Yang undertook various centralized reforms , most notably the equal-field system , intended to reduce economic inequality and improve agricultural productivity ; the institution of the Three Departments and Six Ministries system ; and the standardization and re-unification of the coinage . They also spread and encouraged Buddhism throughout the empire . By the middle of the dynasty , the newly unified empire entered a golden age of prosperity with vast agricultural surplus that supported rapid population growth . A lasting legacy of the Sui dynasty was the Grand Canal . With the eastern capital Luoyang at the center of the network , it linked the west-lying capital Chang'an to the economic and agricultural centers of the east towards Hangzhou , and to the northern border near modern Beijing . While the pressing initial motives were for shipment of grains to the capital , and for transporting troops and military logistics , the reliable inland shipment links would facilitate domestic trades , flow of people and cultural exchange for centuries . Along with the extension of the Great Wall , and the construction of the eastern capital city of Luoyang , these mega projects , led by an efficient centralized bureaucracy , would amass millions of conscripted workers from the large population base , at heavy cost of human lives . After a series of costly and disastrous military campaigns against Goguryeo , one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea , ended in defeat by 614 , the dynasty disintegrated under a series of popular revolts culminating in the assassination of Emperor Yang by his ministers in 618 .",

  "/wiki/Taoism": "Daoism ( /\u02c8da\u028a\u026az\u0259m/ , /\u02c8da\u028a-/ ) , or Taoism ( /\u02c8ta\u028a-/ ) , is a philosophical or religious tradition of Chinese origin which emphasises living in harmony with the Dao ( Chinese : \u9053 ; pinyin : D\u00e0o ; literally : 'the Way ' , also romanized as Tao ) . The Dao is a fundamental idea in most Chinese philosophical schools ; in Daoism , however , it denotes the principle that is the source , pattern and substance of everything that exists . Daoism differs from Confucianism by not emphasising rigid rituals and social order , but is similar in the sense that it is a teaching about the various disciplines for achieving perfection by becoming one with the unplanned rhythms of the universe called the way or dao . Daoist ethics vary depending on the particular school , but in general tend to emphasise wu wei ( action without intention ) , naturalness , simplicity , spontaneity , and the Three Treasures : \u6148 compassion , \u5109 frugality , and \u4e0d\u6562\u70ba\u5929\u4e0b\u5148 humility . The roots of Daoism go back at least to the 4th century BCE . Early Daoism drew its cosmological notions from the School of Yinyang ( Naturalists ) , and was deeply influenced by one of the oldest texts of Chinese culture , the I Ching ( Yi Jing ) , which expounds a philosophical system about how to keep human behavior in accordance with the alternating cycles of nature . The Legalist Shen Buhai ( c. 400 - c. 337 BCE ) may also have been a major influence , expounding a realpolitik of wu wei . The Dao De Jing , a compact book containing teachings attributed to Laozi ( \u8001\u5b50 ; L\u01ceoz\u01d0 ; Lao\u00b3 Tz\u016d\u00b3 ) , is widely considered the keystone work of the Daoist tradition , together with the later writings of Zhuangzi . Daoism has had a profound influence on Chinese culture in the course of the centuries , and Daoists ( \u9053\u58eb ; d\u00e0oshi , masters of the Dao ) , a title traditionally attributed only to the clergy and not to their lay followers , usually take care to note distinction between their ritual tradition and the practices of Chinese folk religion and non-Taoist vernacular ritual orders , which are often mistakenly identified as pertaining to Daoism . Chinese alchemy ( especially neidan ) , Chinese astrology , Chan ( Zen ) Buddhism , several martial arts , traditional Chinese medicine , feng shui , and many styles of qigong have been intertwined with Daoism throughout history . Beyond China , Taoism also had influence on surrounding societies in Asia . Today , the Daoist tradition is one of the five religious doctrines officially recognised in the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) as well as the Republic of China ( ROC ) , and although it does not travel readily from its East Asian roots , [ citation needed ] it claims adherents in a number of societies , in particular in Hong Kong , Macau , and in Southeast Asia .",
  "/wiki/Confucianism": "Confucianism , also known as Ruism , is a system of thought and behavior originating in ancient China . Variously described as tradition , a philosophy , a religion , a humanistic or rationalistic religion , a way of governing , or simply a way of life , Confucianism developed from what was later called the Hundred Schools of Thought from the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius ( 551-479 BCE ) . Confucius considered himself a recodifier and retransmitter of the theology and values inherited from the Shang ( c. 1600-1046 BCE ) and Zhou dynasties ( c. 1046-256 BCE ) for the Warring States period . Confucianism was suppressed during the Legalist and autocratic Qin dynasty ( 221-206 BCE ) , but survived . During the Han dynasty ( 206 BCE-220 CE ) , Confucian approaches edged out the proto-Taoist Huang-Lao as the official ideology , while the emperors mixed both with the realist techniques of Legalism . A Confucian revival began during the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) . In the late Tang , Confucianism developed in response to Buddhism and Taoism and was reformulated as Neo-Confucianism . This reinvigorated form was adopted as the basis of the imperial exams and the core philosophy of the scholar official class in the Song dynasty ( 960-1297 ) . The abolition of the examination system in 1905 marked the end of official Confucianism . The intellectuals of the New Culture Movement of the early twentieth century blamed Confucianism for China 's weaknesses . They searched for new doctrines to replace Confucian teachings ; some of these new ideologies include the Three Principles of the People with the establishment of the Republic of China , and then Maoism under the People 's Republic of China . In the late twentieth century Confucian work ethic has been credited with the rise of the East Asian economy .",

  "/wiki/Sui_dynasty": "The Sui dynasty ( Chinese : \u968b\u671d ; pinyin : Su\u00ed ch\u00e1o ) was a short-lived imperial dynasty of China of pivotal significance . The Sui unified the Northern and Southern dynasties and reinstalled the rule of ethnic Chinese in the entirety of China proper , along with sinicization of former nomadic ethnic minorities ( Five Barbarians ) within its territory . It was succeeded by the Tang dynasty , which largely inherited its foundation . Founded by Emperor Wen of Sui , the Sui dynasty capital was Chang'an ( which was renamed Daxing , 581-605 ) and later Luoyang ( 605-618 ) . Emperors Wen and Yang undertook various centralized reforms , most notably the equal-field system , intended to reduce economic inequality and improve agricultural productivity ; the institution of the Three Departments and Six Ministries system ; and the standardization and re-unification of the coinage . They also spread and encouraged Buddhism throughout the empire . By the middle of the dynasty , the newly unified empire entered a golden age of prosperity with vast agricultural surplus that supported rapid population growth . A lasting legacy of the Sui dynasty was the Grand Canal . With the eastern capital Luoyang at the center of the network , it linked the west-lying capital Chang'an to the economic and agricultural centers of the east towards Hangzhou , and to the northern border near modern Beijing . While the pressing initial motives were for shipment of grains to the capital , and for transporting troops and military logistics , the reliable inland shipment links would facilitate domestic trades , flow of people and cultural exchange for centuries . Along with the extension of the Great Wall , and the construction of the eastern capital city of Luoyang , these mega projects , led by an efficient centralized bureaucracy , would amass millions of conscripted workers from the large population base , at heavy cost of human lives . After a series of costly and disastrous military campaigns against Goguryeo , one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea , ended in defeat by 614 , the dynasty disintegrated under a series of popular revolts culminating in the assassination of Emperor Yang by his ministers in 618 .",

According to Islamic doctrine , he was a prophet , sent to present and confirm the monotheistic teachings preached previously by Adam , Abraham , Moses , Jesus , and other prophets . He is viewed as the final prophet of God in all the main branches of Islam , though some modern denominations diverge from this belief . [ n 3 ] Muhammad united Arabia into a single Muslim polity , with the Quran as well as his teachings and practices forming the basis of Islamic religious belief . He is referred to by many appellations , including Messenger of Allah , The Prophet Muhammad , Allah 's Apostle , Last Prophet of Islam , and others ; there are also many variant spellings of Muhammad , such as Mohamet , Mahamad , Muhamad , and many others . Born approximately 570 CE ( Year of the Elephant ) in the Arabian city of Mecca , Muhammad was orphaned at the age of six . He was raised under the care of his paternal grandfather Abd al-Muttalib , and upon his death , by his uncle Abu Talib . In later years , he would periodically seclude himself in a mountain cave named Hira for several nights of prayer . When he was 40 , Muhammad reported being visited by Gabriel in the cave , and receiving his first revelation from God . Three years later , in 610 , Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly , proclaiming that God is One , that complete submission ( isl\u0101m ) to God is the right way of life ( d\u012bn ) , and that he was a prophet and messenger of God , similar to the other prophets in Islam . The followers of Muhammad were initially few in number , and experienced hostility from Meccan polytheists . He sent some of his followers to Abyssinia in 615 to shield them from prosecution , before he and his followers migrated from Mecca to Medina ( then known as Yathrib ) in 622 .",

The total number of Yarsanis is estimated at around 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 . They are primarily found in western Iran and eastern Iraq and are mostly ethnic Goran Kurds , though there are also smaller groups of Turk , Persian , Lori , Azerbaijani and Arab adherents . Some Yarsanis in Iraq are called Kaka ' i . Yarsanis say that some people call them disparagingly as Ali-o-allahi or worshipers of Ali which labels Yarsanis deny . Many Yarsanis hide their religion due to pressure of Iran 's Islamic system , and there are no exact statistics of their population . The Yarsanis have a distinct religious literature primarily written in the Gorani language . However , few modern Yarsani can read or write Gorani ( a Northwestern Iranian language belonging to the branch Zaza-Gorani ) as their mother tongues are Southern Kurdish and Sorani , which belong to the other two branches of the Kurdish languages .

In the English language , a male deity is referred to as a god , while a female deity is referred to as a goddess . Religions can be categorized by how many deities they worship . Monotheistic religions accept only one deity ( predominantly referred to as God ) , polytheistic religions accept multiple deities . Henotheistic religions accept one supreme deity without denying other deities , considering them as aspects of the same divine principle ; and nontheistic religions deny any supreme eternal creator deity but accept a pantheon of deities which live , die and may be reborn like any other being . :35-37:357-58 Although most monotheistic religions traditionally envision their God as omnipotent , omnipresent , omniscient , omnibenevolent , and eternal , none of these qualities are essential to the definition of a deity and various cultures conceptualized their deities differently .

The Fatimid state took shape among the Kutama , Berbers located in the west of the North African littoral ( now Algeria ) , in 909 conquering Raqqada , the Aghlabid capital . In 921 , the Fatimids established the Tunisian city of Mahdia as their new capital . In 948 they shifted their capital to al-Mansuriyya , near Kairouan in Tunisia . In 969 they conquered Egypt and established Cairo as the capital of their caliphate ; Egypt became the political , cultural , and religious centre of their empire that developed a new , indigenous Arabic culture . The ruling class belonged to the Ismai'li branch of Shi ' a Islam , as did the leaders of the dynasty . The existence of the caliphate marked the only time the descendants of Ali and Fatimah were united to any degree ( except for the final period of the Rashidun Caliphate under Ali himself from 656 to 661 ) and the name Fatimid refers to Fatimah . The different term Fatimi or Fatimite by orientalist authors are sometimes used to refer to the caliphate 's subjects .

It is a monotheistic and Abrahamic religion based on the teachings of Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad and the sixth Fatimid caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah , and Greek philosophers such as Plato , Aristotle , Pythagoras , and Zeno of Citium . The Epistles of Wisdom is the foundational text of the Druze faith . The Druze faith incorporates elements of Isma'ilism , a branch of Shia Islam , Gnosticism , Hinduism , Neoplatonism , Pythagoreanism , and other philosophies and beliefs , creating a distinct and secretive theology , based on an esoteric interpretation of scripture , which emphasises the role of the mind and truthfulness .

Druze believe that at the end of the cycle of rebirth , which is achieved through successive reincarnations , the soul is united with the Cosmic Mind ( al-\u02bfAql al-kull\u012b ) .

With a mainland area of 2,780,400 km2 ( 1,073,500 sq mi ) , [ B ] Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world , the fourth largest in the Americas , the second largest in South America after Brazil , and the largest Spanish-speaking nation . The sovereign state is subdivided into twenty-three provinces ( Spanish : provincias , singular provincia ) and one autonomous city ( ciudad aut\u00f3noma ) , Buenos Aires , which is the federal capital of the nation ( Spanish : Capital Federal ) as decided by Congress . The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions , but exist under a federal system . Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica , the Falkland Islands ( Spanish : Islas Malvinas ) , and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period . The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times . The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810-1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with several waves of European immigration , mainly Italians and Spaniards , radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook ; 62.5% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry , and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture .",

  "/wiki/Shinto": "Shinto , [ a ] also known as Shintoism or kami-no-michi , [ b ] is a religion originating from Japan . Classified as an East Asian religion by scholars of religion , its practitioners often regard it as Japan 's indigenous religion . Scholars sometimes call its practitioners Shintoists , although adherents rarely use that term themselves . Shinto is polytheistic and revolves around the kami ( gods or spirits ) , supernatural entities believed to inhabit all things . The link between the kami and the natural world has led to Shinto being considered animistic and pantheistic . The kami are worshiped at kamidana household shrines , family shrines , and public shrines . The latter are staffed by priests who oversee offerings to the kami and the provision of religious paraphernalia such as amulets to the religion 's adherents . Other common rituals include the kagura ritual dances , age specific celebrations , and seasonal festivals . These festivals and rituals are collectively called matsuri . A major conceptual focus in Shinto is ensuring purity by cleansing practices of various types including ritual washing or bathing . Shinto does not emphasize specific moral codes other than ritual purity , reverence for kami , and regular communion following seasonal practices . Shinto has no single creator or specific doctrinal text , but exists in a diverse range of localized and regionalised forms .",
  "/wiki/Shinto_shrine": "A Shinto shrine ( \u795e\u793e , jinja , archaic : shinsha , meaning : place of the god ( s ) ) is a structure whose main purpose is to house ( enshrine ) one or more kami .

Although only one word ( shrine ) is used in English , in Japanese , Shinto shrines may carry any one of many different , non-equivalent names like gongen , -g\u016b , jinja , jing\u016b , mori , my\u014djin , -sha , taisha , ubusuna , or yashiro . ( For details , see the section Interpreting shrine names . ) Structurally , a Shinto shrine is usually characterized by the presence of a honden [ note 1 ] or sanctuary , where the kami is enshrined . The honden may however be completely absent , as for example when the shrine stands on a sacred mountain to which it is dedicated , and which is worshipped directly . The honden may also be missing when there are nearby altar-like structures called himorogi or objects believed to be capable of attracting spirits called yorishiro that can serve as a direct bond to a kami . There may be a haiden ( \u62dd\u6bbf , meaning : hall of worship ) and other structures as well ( see below ) . However , a shrine 's most important building is used for the safekeeping of sacred objects rather than for worship . Miniature shrines ( hokora ) can occasionally be found on roadsides . Large shrines sometimes have on their precincts miniature shrines , sessha ( \u6442\u793e ) or massha ( \u672b\u793e ) . [ note 2 ] The portable shrines ( mikoshi ) which are carried on poles during festivals ( matsuri ) enshrine kami and are therefore true shrines .",
