  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels .",

  "/wiki/HMS_Hussar_(J82)": "HMS Hussar was a Royal Navy Halcyon-class minesweeper of World War II . As the Allied armies advanced following the invasion of Normandy , Hussar , Britomart , Jason and Salamander were assigned to the 1st Minesweeping Flotilla ( 1MF ) clearing Axis minefields north of Normandy to open additional ports to supply the advance . On the afternoon of 27 August 1944 , they were sweeping off Cap d'Antifer in preparation for the battleship Warspite and monitors Erebus and Roberts to engage Le Havre coastal artillery delaying the advance of Canadian troops . The headquarters officer assigning the minesweeping project to 1MF neglected to inform the Flag Officer British Assault Area ( Rear - Admiral Rivett - Carnac ) , who was responsible for defending the invasion beaches from E-boats operating out of Le Havre . 1MF was observed on a southwesterly leg of the minesweeping operation and assumed to be German ships proceeding to attack Allied shipping off the invasion beaches . The Admiral 's staff requested No . 263 Squadron RAF and No . 266 Squadron RAF to attack the presumed enemy ships . The squadrons responded with 16 Typhoons armed with 20 mm cannon and High Explosive 60 lb RP-3 unguided rockets . RAF pilots identified 1MF as apparently friendly shipping , but upon questioning their orders were told the Royal Navy had no ships in the area . In a well-executed attack out of the sun at 13:30 , the Typhoons sank Hussar and Britomart ; and Salamander was damaged far beyond economical repair and written off as a constructive total loss . Eighty-six British sailors were killed and 124 more were injured .",

  "/wiki/HMS_Seagull_(J85)": "HMS Seagull was a Halcyon-class minesweeper , and the first Royal Navy ship to be built entirely without rivets . She was completed on 30 March 1938 . She was adopted by the civil community of Christchurch , Hampshire after a successful Warship Week National Savings campaign in February 1942 During the Second World War she helped escort 21 Arctic convoys , and participated in Operation Neptune . She was also involved in the accidental sinking of the Polish submarine ORP Jastrz\u0105b , along with HNoMS St Albans , during the passage of Arctic Convoy PQ 15 . Five crewmen were killed . A court of Enquiry found that Jastrz\u0105b was 100 nautical miles ( 190 km ) out of position , in an area where U-boats were expected to operate , and no blame could be attached to either commander . However , other sources maintain the convoy changed its course and entered Jastrz\u0105b 's patrol sector . Also that the Allied ships ignored identification marks , while on surface , and that Seagull 's commander was later found guilty by the Admiralty . These accounts are not reconcilable . In late 1945 she was converted in Rotterdam to a Survey Ship . Until 1950 she operated in home waters , after which she was paid off into the reserve . She became the naval drill ship at Leith in 1955 before being scrapped by Demmelweek and Redding in Plymouth in 1956 .",

  "/wiki/Soviet_Union": "The Soviet Union , [ b ] officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR or \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 ) , [ c ] was a federal sovereign state in northern Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991 . Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas ."
