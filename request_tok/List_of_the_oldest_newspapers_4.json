  "/wiki/Sydney": "Sydney ( /\u02c8s\u026adni/ ( listen ) SID-nee ) is the state capital of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia and Oceania . Located on Australia 's east coast , the metropolis surrounds Port Jackson and extends about 70 km ( 43.5 mi ) on its periphery towards the Blue Mountains to the west , Hawkesbury to the north , the Royal National Park to the south and Macarthur to the south-west . Sydney is made up of 658 suburbs , 40 local government areas and 15 contiguous regions . Residents of the city are known as Sydneysiders . As of June 2017 , Sydney 's estimated metropolitan population was 5,230,330 and is home to approximately 65% of the state 's population . Indigenous Australians have inhabited the Sydney area for at least 30,000 years , and thousands of engravings remain throughout the region , making it one of the richest in Australia in terms of Aboriginal archaeological sites . During his first Pacific voyage in 1770 , Lieutenant James Cook and his crew became the first Europeans to chart the eastern coast of Australia , making landfall at Botany Bay and inspiring British interest in the area . In 1788 , the First Fleet of convicts , led by Arthur Phillip , founded Sydney as a British penal colony , the first European settlement in Australia . Phillip named the city Sydney in recognition of Thomas Townshend , 1st Viscount Sydney . Penal transportation to New South Wales ended soon after Sydney was incorporated as a city in 1842 . A gold rush occurred in the colony in 1851 , and over the next century , Sydney transformed from a colonial outpost into a major global cultural and economic centre . After World War II , it experienced mass migration and became one of the most multicultural cities in the world .",

It is named after the city of Perth , Scotland and is Australia 's fourth-most populous city , with a population of 2.06 million living in Greater Perth . Perth is part of the South West Land Division of Western Australia , with most of the metropolitan area on the Swan Coastal Plain , a narrow strip between the Indian Ocean and the Darling Scarp . The first areas settled were on the Swan River at Guildford , with the city 's central business district and port ( Fremantle ) both later founded downriver . Captain James Stirling founded Perth in 1829 as the administrative centre of the Swan River Colony . It gained city status ( currently vested in the smaller City of Perth ) in 1856 and was promoted to the status of a Lord Mayorality in 1929 . The city inherited its name due to the influence of Sir George Murray , then Member of Parliament for Perthshire and Secretary of State for War and the Colonies . The city 's population increased substantially as a result of the Western Australian gold rushes in the late 19th century . During Australia 's involvement in World War II , Fremantle served as a base for submarines operating in the Pacific Theatre , and a US Navy Catalina flying boat fleet was based at Matilda Bay . An influx of immigrants after the war , predominantly from Britain , Italy , Greece , and Yugoslavia , led to rapid population growth . This was followed by a surge in economic activity flowing from several mining booms in the late 20th and early 21st centuries that saw Perth become the regional headquarters for several large mining operations . As part of Perth 's role as the capital of Western Australia , the state 's Parliament and Supreme Court are in the city , as is Government House , the residence of the Governor of Western Australia .",

  "/wiki/Wanganui_Chronicle": "The Whanganui Chronicle is New Zealand 's oldest newspaper . Based in Whanganui , it celebrated 160 years of publishing in September 2016 . Local resident Henry Stokes first proposed the paper for Petre , as the town was then called , but initial publication was held back by lack of equipment . As no printing press was available , Stokes approached the technical master at Wanganui Collegiate School , Rev . Charles Nicholls , and together they constructed a maire wood and iron makeshift printing press , on which , with the help of the staff and pupils of the school , the first edition of the Wanganui Chronicle ( as it was then spelled ) was printed on 18 September 1856 . The motto of the paper , printed at the top of the editorial column , was Verite Sans Peur , French for Truth without Fear . Initially the paper was sold fortnightly , at a price of six pence . In 1866 the Chronicle went tri-weekly , and in 1871 began publishing daily and has done so since . The paper was owned and edited by Gilbert Carson from 1875 onwards . In the 1880s Carson 's sister Margaret Bullock worked as a reporter and assistant editor for the paper , and , along with Laura Jane Suisted , was one of the first female parliamentary correspondents in New Zealand . The woman editor for a time in the 1920s using her birth name Iris Wilkinson , later published poetry and novels as Robin Hyde , and is now acknowledged as a major figure in New Zealand twentieth-century culture .

The Whanganui River , New Zealand 's longest navigable waterway , runs from Mount Tongariro to the sea . Whanganui is part of the Manawat\u016b-Whanganui region . Whanganui is the ancestral home of Te \u0100ti Haunui-a-P\u0101p\u0101rangi and other Whanganui M\u0101ori tribes . The New Zealand Company began to settle the area in 1840 , establishing its second settlement after Wellington . In the early years most European settlers came via Wellington . Whanganui greatly expanded in the 1870s , and freezing works , woollen mills , phosphate works and wool stores were established in the town . Today , much of Whanganui 's economy relates directly to the fertile and prosperous farming hinterland . Like several New Zealand urban areas , it was officially designated a city until an administrative reorganisation in 1989 , and is now run by a District Council . Although the city was called Wanganui from 1854 , in February 2009 , the New Zealand Geographic Board recommended the spelling be changed to Whanganui .

The province and region of Otago takes its name from the Ngai Tahu village of Otakou at the mouth of the harbour , which became a whaling station in the 1830s . In 1848 a Scottish settlement was established by the Lay Association of the Free Church of Scotland . Between 1855 and 1900 many thousands of Scots emigrated to the incorporated city .
