The high Chickasaw Bluffs protecting the location from the waters of the Mississippi would then be contested between the Spanish , French , and the English as Memphis took shape . Modern Memphis was founded in 1819 by three prominent Americans : John Overton , James Winchester , and future president Andrew Jackson . Memphis grew into one of the largest cities of the Antebellum South as a market for agricultural goods , natural resources like lumber , and the American slave trade . After the American Civil War and the end of slavery , the city experienced even faster growth into the 20th century as it became among the largest world markets for cotton and lumber .

By 1824 more people worked in manufacturing than agriculture or trade , and the city had a cotton mill , processing cotton from the Deep South . Numerous mills in New York had such ties with the South .

  "/wiki/Wright_brothers": "The Wright brothers - Orville ( August 19 , 1871 - January 30 , 1948 ) and Wilbur ( April 16 , 1867 - May 30 , 1912 ) - were two American aviation pioneers generally credited with inventing , building , and flying the world 's first successful motor-operated airplane . They made the first controlled , sustained flight of a powered , heavier-than-air aircraft with the Wright Flyer on December 17 , 1903 , 4 mi ( 6 km ) south of Kitty Hawk , North Carolina . In 1904-05 , the brothers developed their flying machine to make longer-running and more aerodynamic flights with the Wright Flyer II , followed by the first truly practical fixed-wing aircraft , the Wright Flyer III . The Wright brothers were also the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed-wing powered flight possible . The brothers ' breakthrough was their creation of a three-axis control system , which enabled the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and to maintain its equilibrium . This method remains standard on fixed-wing aircraft of all kinds . From the beginning of their aeronautical work , the Wright brothers focused on developing a reliable method of pilot control as the key to solving the flying problem . This approach differed significantly from other experimenters of the time who put more emphasis on developing powerful engines . Using a small home-built wind tunnel , the Wrights also collected more accurate data than any before , enabling them to design more efficient wings and propellers . Their first U.S. patent did not claim invention of a flying machine , but a system of aerodynamic control that manipulated a flying machine 's surfaces . The brothers gained the mechanical skills essential to their success by working for years in their Dayton , Ohio-based shop with printing presses , bicycles , motors , and other machinery . Their work with bicycles , in particular , influenced their belief that an unstable vehicle such as a flying machine could be controlled and balanced with practice .",

The city 's unique industrial past and its location as a transportation hub combined to create wealth for Virginia and the Middle Atlantic and Upper South regions of the nation . Early in the colonial era of the 18th century , Petersburg was the final destination on the Upper Appomattox Canal Navigation System because of its location on the Appomattox River with its connection to the James River to the east at the Atlantic Seaboard fall line ( the head of navigation of rivers on the U.S. East Coast ) and the tying in with the James River shipping traffic was a strategic place for transportation and commercial activities . It connected commerce as far inland as Farmville , Virginia at the foothills of the Blue Ridge and the Appalachian Mountains chain , to shipping further east into the Chesapeake Bay and North Atlantic Ocean . For similar reasons , 17th century era Fort Henry was built at the order of the Virginia House of Burgesses at Petersburg in 1645 to protect the river traffic . As railroads were being constructed and extended in the state in the 1830s and 1840s , Petersburg was developed as a major transfer point for both north-south and east-west competitors .
