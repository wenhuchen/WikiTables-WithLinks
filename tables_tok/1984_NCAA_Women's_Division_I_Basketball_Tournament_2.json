In Round 1 , the higher seed was given the opportunity to host the first-round game . In most cases , the higher seed accepted the opportunity . The exceptions : [ 6 ] Ole Miss was a 4 seed , but unable to host , so the game was played at 5 seed Ohio State Alabama was a 2 seed , but played at Central Michigan , the 7 seed Missouri was a 4 seed , but played at LSU , the 5 seed Kansas State was a 3 seed , but played at Northeast Louisiana , the 6 seed Oregon was a 3 seed , but played at San Diego State , the 6 seed Long Beach State was a 2 seed , playing the 7 seed , University of Nevada , Las Vegas . The game was played at the University of Southern California ( USC ) . For this reason there are only 15 first round venues , as all locations hosted one game except the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena , home of USC , which hosted two games .
