The island is mainly covered in dense tropical rainforest and has a mountainous interior . Guadalcanal 's discovery by westerners was under the Spanish expedition of \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a in 1568 . The name comes from the village of Guadalcanal , in the province of Seville , in Andalusia , Spain , birthplace of Pedro de Ortega Valencia , a member of Menda\u00f1a 's expedition . During 1942-43 , it was the scene of the Guadalcanal Campaign and saw bitter fighting between Japanese and US troops . The Americans were ultimately victorious . At the end of World War II , Honiara , on the north coast of Guadalcanal , became the new capital of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate .",
  "/wiki/Naval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal": "The Naval Battle of Guadalcanal , sometimes referred to as the Third and Fourth Battles of Savo Island , the Battle of the Solomons , the Battle of Friday the 13th , or , in Japanese sources , the Third Battle of the Solomon Sea ( \u7b2c\u4e09\u6b21\u30bd\u30ed\u30e2\u30f3\u6d77\u6226 , Dai-san-ji Soromon Kaisen ) , took place from 12-15 November 1942 , and was the decisive engagement in a series of naval battles between Allied ( primarily American ) and Imperial Japanese forces during the months-long Guadalcanal Campaign in the Solomon Islands during World War II . The action consisted of combined air and sea engagements over four days , most near Guadalcanal and all related to a Japanese effort to reinforce land forces on the island . The only two U.S. Navy admirals to be killed in a surface engagement in the war were lost in this battle . Allied forces landed on Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942 and seized an airfield , later called Henderson Field , that was under construction by the Japanese military . There were several subsequent attempts to recapture the airfield by the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy using reinforcements delivered to Guadalcanal by ship , efforts which ultimately failed . In early November 1942 , the Japanese organized a transport convoy to take 7,000 infantry troops and their equipment to Guadalcanal to attempt once again to retake the airfield . Several Japanese warship forces were assigned to bombard Henderson Field with the goal of destroying Allied aircraft that posed a threat to the convoy . Learning of the Japanese reinforcement effort , U.S. forces launched aircraft and warship attacks to defend Henderson Field and prevent the Japanese ground troops from reaching Guadalcanal . In the resulting battle , both sides lost numerous warships in two extremely destructive surface engagements at night . Nevertheless , the U.S. succeeded in turning back attempts by the Japanese to bombard Henderson Field with battleships . Allied aircraft also sank most of the Japanese troop transports and prevented the majority of the Japanese troops and equipment from reaching Guadalcanal . Thus , the battle turned back Japan 's last major attempt to dislodge Allied forces from Guadalcanal and nearby Tulagi , resulting in a strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies and deciding the ultimate outcome of the Guadalcanal campaign in their favor .",

The convoy consisted of two seaplane tenders and six destroyers and was commanded by Rear Admiral Takatsugu Jojima . At the same time , but in a separate operation , three heavy cruisers and two destroyers - under the command of Rear Admiral Aritomo Got\u014d - were to bombard the Allied airfield on Guadalcanal ( called Henderson Field by the Allies ) with the object of destroying Allied aircraft and the airfield 's facilities .

Later on the morning of 12 October , four Japanese destroyers from the supply convoy turned back to assist Got\u014d 's retreating , damaged warships . Air attacks by U.S. aircraft from Henderson Field sank two of these destroyers later that day ."
