The hosting of the games provided a significant legacy of infrastructure within St. Petersburg . Around 500 kilometres ( 300 mi ) of road was repaved , venues and landmarks were renovated , computer equipment was installed and donated , and 70 purpose-built Games buses were later integrated into the city 's public transport system . The prospect of a Russia more open to foreign investment sparked growth in the level of sponsorship and the games attracted 30 international sponsors . Television coverage also expanded ; the games was broadcast throughout the United States on both TBS and the ABC Television Network , and the games events were shown in a total of 129 countries . The weightlifting events saw five world records broken as Russia lifters took a clean sweep of the gold medals .",

  "/wiki/Rowing_(sport)": "Rowing , sometimes referred to as crew in the United States , is a sport whose origins reach back to Ancient Egyptian times . It involves propelling a boat ( racing shell ) on water using oars . By pushing against the water with an oar , a force is generated to move the boat . The sport can be either recreational for enjoyment or fitness , or competitive , when athletes race against each other in boats . There are a number of different boat classes in which athletes compete , ranging from an individual shell ( called a single scull ) to an eight-person shell with a coxswain ( called a coxed eight ) . Modern rowing as a competitive sport can be traced to the early 17th century when races ( regattas ) were held between professional watermen on the River Thames in London , United Kingdom . Often prizes were offered by the London Guilds and Livery Companies . Amateur competition began towards the end of the 18th century with the arrival of boat clubs at the British public schools of Eton College , Shrewsbury School , Durham School , and Westminster School . Similarly , clubs were formed at the University of Oxford , with a race held between Brasenose College and Jesus College in 1815 . At the University of Cambridge the first recorded races were in 1827 . Public rowing clubs were beginning at the same time ; in England Leander Club was founded in 1818 , in Germany Der Hamburger und Germania Ruder Club was founded in 1836 and in the United States Narragansett Boat Club was founded in 1838 and Detroit Boat Club was founded in 1839 . In 1843 , the first American college rowing club was formed at Yale University .",

Artistic swimming is governed internationally by FINA , and has been part of the Summer Olympics programme since 1984 . Synchronised swimming demands advanced water skills , requires great strength , endurance , flexibility , grace , artistry and precise timing , as well as exceptional breath control when upside down underwater . Competitors show off their strength , flexibility , and aerobic endurance required to perform difficult routines . Swimmers perform two routines for judges , one technical and one free , as well as age group routines and figures . Synchronized swimming is both an individual and team sport . Swimmers compete individually during figures , and then as a team during the routine . Figures are made up of a combination of skills and positions that often require control , strength , and flexibility . Swimmers are ranked individually for this part of the competition . The routine involves teamwork and synchronisation . It is choreographed to music and often has a theme . Since the 20th century , synchronised swimming has predominantly been considered a women 's sport , with the Summer Olympics only featuring women 's duet and team events .",

  "/wiki/Tennis": "Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent ( singles ) or between two teams of two players each ( doubles ) . Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent 's court . The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return . The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point , while the opposite player will . Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages . The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket , including wheelchair users . The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham , England , in the late 19th century as lawn tennis . It had close connections both to various field ( lawn ) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis . During most of the 19th century , in fact , the term tennis referred to real tennis , not lawn tennis . The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s . Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times , and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s . A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system , which allows a player to contest the line call of a point , a system known as Hawk-Eye .",
  "/wiki/Triathlon": "A triathlon is a multisport race with three continuous and sequential endurance races . The word is of Greek origin , from \u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2 or treis ( three ) and \u1f06\u03b8\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 or athlos ( competition ) . While variations of the sport exist , the most common form includes swimming , cycling , and running over various distances . Triathletes compete for fastest overall course completion , including timed transitions between the three races . A transition area is set up where the athletes change gear for different segments of the race . This is where the switches from swimming to cycling and cycling to running occur . These areas are used to store bicycles , performance apparel , and any other accessories needed for the next stage of the race . The transition from swim to bike is referred to as T1 and that between the bike and run is referred to as T2 . The athlete 's overall time for the race includes time spent in T1 and T2 . Transition areas vary in size depending on the number of participants expected . In addition , these areas provide a social headquarters before the race . The nature of the sport focuses on persistent and often periodized training in each of the three disciplines , as well as combination workouts and general strength conditioning .",
  "/wiki/Volleyball": "Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net . Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team 's court under organized rules . It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964 . The complete set of rules are extensive , but play essentially proceeds as follows : a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally ' by serving the ball ( tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm ) , from behind the back boundary line of the court , over the net , and into the receiving team 's court . The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court . The team may touch the ball up to 3 times , but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively . Typically , the first two touches are used to set up for an attack , an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court . The rally continues , with each team allowed as many as three consecutive touches , until either ( 1 ) : a team makes a kill , grounding the ball on the opponent 's court and winning the rally ; or ( 2 ) : a team commits a fault and loses the rally . The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally . A few of the most common faults include :",
  "/wiki/Water_polo": "Water polo is a competitive team sport played in the water between two teams . The game consists of four quarters in which the two teams attempt to score goals by throwing the ball into the opposing team 's goal . The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins the match . Each team is made up of six field players and one goalkeeper . Except for the goalkeeper , players participate in both offensive and defensive roles . Water polo is typically played in an all-deep pool meaning that players can not touch the bottom . A game of water polo mainly consists of the players swimming to move about the pool , treading water ( often using the eggbeater kick technique ) , passing the ball and shooting at the goal . Teamwork , tactical thinking and game awareness are also highly important aspects in a game of water polo . Water polo is a highly physical and demanding sport and has frequently been cited as one of the toughest sports to play . Special equipment for water polo includes a water polo ball , a yellow-green ball which floats on the water ; numbered and coloured caps ; and two goals , which either float in the water or are attached to the side of the pool . The game is thought to have originated in Scotland in the late 19th century as a sort of water rugby . William Wilson is thought to have developed the game during a similar period .",
  "/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting": "Olympic weightlifting , or Olympic-style weightlifting , often simply referred to as weightlifting , is a sport in which the athlete attempts a maximum-weight single lift of a barbell loaded with weight plates . The two competition lifts in order are the snatch and the clean and jerk . The snatch is a wide-grip , one-move lift . The clean and jerk is a close-grip , two-move lift . Each weightlifter receives three attempts in each , and the combined total of the highest two successful lifts determines the overall result within a bodyweight category . Bodyweight categories are different for male and female competitors . A lifter who fails to complete at least one successful snatch and one successful clean and jerk also fails to total , and therefore receives an incomplete entry for the competition . The clean and press was once a competition lift , but was discontinued due to difficulties in judging proper form . In comparison with other strength sports , which test limit strength ( with or without lifting aids ) , weightlifting tests aspects of human ballistic limits ( explosive strength ) ; the lifts are therefore executed faster - and with more mobility and a greater range of motion during their execution - than other strength movements . The lifts performed in the sport of weightlifting , and in particular their component lifts ( e.g . squats , deadlifts , cleans ) , are commonly used by elite athletes in other sports to train for both explosive and functional strength .",
