  "/wiki/Drama_film": "In film and television , drama is a genre of narrative fiction ( or semi-fiction ) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone . Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre , such as police crime drama , political drama , legal drama , historical period drama , domestic drama , teen drama or comedy-drama . These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted . Radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance , it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio .",

  "/wiki/Action_film": "Action film is a film genre in which the protagonist or protagonists are thrust into a series of events that typically include violence , extended fighting , physical feats , and frantic chases . Action films tend to feature a resourceful hero struggling against incredible odds , which include life-threatening situations , a villain , or a pursuit which usually concludes in victory for the hero ( though a small number of films in this genre have ended in the victory for the villain instead ) . Advancements in CGI have made it cheaper and easier to create action sequences and other visual effects that required the efforts of professional stunt crews in the past . However , reactions to action films containing significant amounts of CGI have been mixed , as films that use computer animations to create unrealistic , highly unbelievable events are often met with criticism . While action has long been a recurring component in films , the action film genre began to develop in the 1970s along with the increase of stunts and special effects . Common action scenes in films are generally , but not limited to , explosions , car chases , fistfights , and shootouts . This genre is closely associated with the thriller and adventure genres , and they may also contain elements of drama and spy fiction .",
