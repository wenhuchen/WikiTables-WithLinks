Dominating the race from the start , Ledecky quickly dropped two seconds under a world-record pace , as she pulled further away from the field to overturn her own existing standard with a gold-medal time in 8:04.79 . Separated from the leader by 11.38 seconds , Great Britain 's Jazmin Carlin edged out the Hungarian challenger Bogl\u00e1rka Kap\u00e1s at the final lap for her second silver of the meet in 8:16.17 . Meanwhile , Kap\u00e1s faded down the stretch to earn a bronze in 8:16.37 , two tenths of a second short of Carlin 's time . London 2012 runner-up Mireia Belmonte slipped off the podium to fourth in a Spanish record of 8:18.55 . Outside the 8:20 club , Australia 's Jessica Ashwood ( 8:20.32 ) and Ledecky 's teammate Leah Smith ( 8:20.95 ) , bronze medalist in the 400 m freestyle , picked up the fifth and sixth spots respectively , finishing 63-hundredths of a second apart from each other . Denmark 's Lotte Friis ( 8:24.50 ) and Germany 's Sarah K\u00f6hler ( 8:27.75 ) rounded out the championship field . Ledecky also overturned the existing Olympic record in 8:12.86 to top the field of twenty-seven swimmers in the prelims , taking 1.24 seconds off the standard set by Great Britain 's Rebecca Adlington in a since-banned high-tech bodysuit in Beijing eight years earlier .",
