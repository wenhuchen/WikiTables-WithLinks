She scored an 8.537 but redeemed herself slightly on balance beam . By then , and after two falls from teammate Li Ya on beam , it was too late and China ranked 7th that evening .",

  "/wiki/Monette_Russo": "Monette Simone Russo ( born 4 August 1988 in Lilydale , Victoria ) is an Australian former artistic gymnast . She made history by becoming the first Australian gymnast ever to win an individual world championship medal at the 2005 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in Melbourne , Australia , when she came third in the all-around competition and also was awarded the prestigious Longines Prize for Elegance . She also competed in three apparatus finals , finishing seventh on bars and fifth on beam and floor . Although more of an all-arounder than an events finalist , during her career she was one of the few women competing two vaults . She was also a part of the 2003 World Championships Team for Australia and won a bronze medal , another first for Australian gymnastics . Monette is an Olympian , having helped Australia to 8th place in the 2004 Olympics . An injury prevented her from competing in the all-around final . Injury also marred Monette 's 2006 season . She competed at the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne , and although she had to reduce her difficulty considerably because of her injury ( only one double salto on floor , for example ) she still assisted Australia to the team gold . Having qualified to the all-around , bars , and beam finals , three more medals looked likely . However , injury prevented Monette from competing in the all-around , and she fell off the beam , while receiving a bronze on bars behind Elyse Hopfner-Hibbs and Shavahn Church . Monette retired from elite gymnastics in May 2007 ."
