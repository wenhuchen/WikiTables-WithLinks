  "/wiki/Sickle-cell_disease": "Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) is a group of blood disorders typically inherited from a person 's parents . The most common type is known as sickle cell anaemia ( SCA ) . It results in an abnormality in the oxygen-carrying protein haemoglobin found in red blood cells . This leads to a rigid , sickle-like shape under certain circumstances . Problems in sickle cell disease typically begin around 5 to 6 months of age . A number of health problems may develop , such as attacks of pain ( sickle cell crisis ) , anemia , swelling in the hands and feet , bacterial infections and stroke . Long-term pain may develop as people get older . The average life expectancy in the developed world is 40 to 60 years . Sickle cell disease occurs when a person inherits two abnormal copies of the \u03b2-globin gene that makes haemoglobin , one from each parent . This gene occurs in chromosome 11 . Several subtypes exist , depending on the exact mutation in each haemoglobin gene . An attack can be set off by temperature changes , stress , dehydration , and high altitude .",

  "/wiki/Food_preservation": "Food preservation prevents the growth of microorganisms ( such as yeasts ) , or other microorganisms ( although some methods work by introducing benign bacteria or fungi to the food ) , as well as slowing the oxidation of fats that cause rancidity . Food preservation may also include processes that inhibit visual deterioration , such as the enzymatic browning reaction in apples after they are cut during food preparation . Many processes designed to preserve food involve more than one food preservation method . Preserving fruit by turning it into jam , for example , involves boiling ( to reduce the fruit 's moisture content and to kill bacteria , etc . ) , sugaring ( to prevent their re-growth ) and sealing within an airtight jar ( to prevent recontamination ) . Some traditional methods of preserving food have been shown to have a lower energy input and carbon footprint , when compared to modern methods . Some methods of food preservation are known to create carcinogens . In 2015 , the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization classified processed meat , i.e . meat that has undergone salting , curing , fermenting , and smoking , as carcinogenic to humans .

  "/wiki/Defibrillator": "Defibrillation is a treatment for life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias , specifically ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) and non-perfusing ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) . A defibrillator delivers a dose of electric current ( often called a counter-shock ) to the heart . Although not fully understood , this process depolarizes a large amount of the heart muscle , ending the dysrhythmia . Subsequently , the body 's natural pacemaker in the sinoatrial node of the heart is able to re-establish normal sinus rhythm . A heart which is in asystole ( flatline ) can not be restarted by a defibrillator , but would be treated by cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) . In contrast to defibrillation , synchronized electrical cardioversion is an electrical shock delivered in synchrony to the cardiac cycle . Although the person may still be critically ill , cardioversion normally aims to end poorly perfusing cardiac dysrhythmias , such as supraventricular tachycardia . Defibrillators can be external , transvenous , or implanted ( implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ) , depending on the type of device used or needed . Some external units , known as automated external defibrillators ( AEDs ) , automate the diagnosis of treatable rhythms , meaning that lay responders or bystanders are able to use them successfully with little or no training .",

  "/wiki/Physician": "A physician ( American English ) , medical practitioner ( Commonwealth English ) , medical doctor , or simply doctor , is a professional who practises medicine , which is concerned with promoting , maintaining , or restoring health through the study , diagnosis , prognosis and treatment of disease , injury , and other physical and mental impairments . Physicians may focus their practice on certain disease categories , types of patients , and methods of treatment - known as specialities - or they may assume responsibility for the provision of continuing and comprehensive medical care to individuals , families , and communities - known as general practice . Medical practice properly requires both a detailed knowledge of the academic disciplines , such as anatomy and physiology , underlying diseases and their treatment - the science of medicine - and also a decent competence in its applied practice - the art or craft of medicine . Both the role of the physician and the meaning of the word itself vary around the world . Degrees and other qualifications vary widely , but there are some common elements , such as medical ethics requiring that physicians show consideration , compassion , and benevolence for their patients .",
  "/wiki/Gastroenterology": "Gastroenterology is the branch of medicine focused on the digestive system and its disorders . Diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract , which include the organs from mouth into anus , along the alimentary canal , are the focus of this speciality . Physicians practicing in this field are called gastroenterologists . They have usually completed about eight years of pre-medical and medical education , a year-long internship ( if this is not a part of the residency ) , three years of an internal medicine residency , and two to three years in the gastroenterology fellowship . Gastroenterologists perform a number of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures including colonoscopy , endoscopy , endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) , endoscopic ultrasound and liver biopsy . Some gastroenterology trainees will complete a fourth-year ( although this is often their seventh year of graduate medical education ) in transplant hepatology , advanced endoscopy , inflammatory bowel disease , motility or other topics . Hepatology , or hepatobiliary medicine , encompasses the study of the liver , pancreas , and biliary tree , while proctology encompasses the fields of anus and rectum diseases . They are traditionally considered sub-specialties of gastroenterology ."
