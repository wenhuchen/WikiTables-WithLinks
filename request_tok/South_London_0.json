  "/wiki/London_borough": "The London boroughs are the 32 local authority districts that make up Greater London ; each is governed by a London borough council . The London boroughs were all created at the same time as Greater London on 1 April 1965 by the London Government Act 1963 and are a type of local government district . Twelve were designated as Inner London boroughs and twenty as Outer London boroughs . The London boroughs have populations of around 150,000 to 300,000 . Inner London boroughs tend to be smaller , in both population and area , and more densely populated than Outer London boroughs . The London boroughs were created by combining groups of former local government units . A review undertaken between 1987 and 1992 led to a number of relatively small alterations in borough boundaries . London borough councils provide the majority of local government services ( schools , waste management , social services , libraries ) , in contrast to the strategic Greater London Authority , which has limited authority over all of Greater London . The councils were first elected in 1964 and acted as shadow authorities until 1 April 1965 . Each borough is divided into electoral wards , subject to periodic review , for the purpose of electing councillors . Council elections take place every four years , with the most recent elections in 2018 and the next elections due in 2022 . The political make-up of London borough councils is dominated by the Conservative , Labour and Liberal Democrat parties .",

It was integrated by the Post Office into the national postcode system of the United Kingdom during the early 1970s and corresponds to the N , NW , SW , SE , W , WC , E and EC postcode areas .

Croydon is mentioned in Domesday Book , and from a small market town has expanded into one of the most populous areas on the fringe of London . The borough is now one of London 's leading business , financial and cultural centres , and its influence in entertainment and the arts contribute to its status as a major metropolitan centre . The borough was formed in 1965 from the merger of the County Borough of Croydon with Coulsdon and Purley Urban District , both of which had been within Surrey . The local authority , Croydon London Borough Council , is now part of London Councils , the local government association for Greater London . The economic strength of Croydon dates back mainly to Croydon Airport which was a major factor in the development of Croydon as a business centre . Once London 's main airport for all international flights to and from the capital , it was closed on 30 September 1959 due to the lack of expansion space needed for an airport to serve the growing city .
