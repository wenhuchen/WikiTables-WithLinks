  "/wiki/Maki-e": "Maki-e ( \u8494\u7d75 , literally : sprinkled picture ) is Japanese lacquer sprinkled with gold or silver powder as a decoration using a makizutsu or a kebo brush . The oldest Maki-e in existence now is the ornamentation on the sheath of the Kara-tachi sword with gilded silver fittings and inlay in Togidashi technique held by Sh\u014ds\u014din in Nara , Japan . Originally the sword was treasured by the Emperor Sh\u014dmu ( 701 - June 4 , 756 ) The technique was developed mainly in the Heian period ( 794-1185 ) and blossomed in the Edo period ( 1603-1868 ) . Maki-e objects were initially designed as household items for court nobles ; they soon gained more popularity and were adopted by royal families and military leaders as a symbol of power . To create different colours and textures , maki-e artists use a variety of metal powders including gold , silver , copper , brass , lead , aluminum , platinum , and pewter , as well as their alloys . Bamboo tubes and soft brushes of various sizes are used for laying powders and drawing fine lines . As it requires highly skilled craftsmanship to produce a maki-e painting , young artists usually go through many years of training to develop the skills and to ultimately become maki-e masters . K\u014dami D\u014dch\u014d ( 1410-1478 ) was the first lacquer master linked to specific works . His maki-e works used designs from various Japanese contemporary painters . K\u014dami and another maki-e master , Igarashi Shinsai , were originators of the two major schools of lacquer-making in the history of Japan . Takamakie ( or raised maki-e ) is one of the three major techniques in maki-e making . Developed in the Muromachi period ( 1336-1573 ) , the technique of takamakie involves building up design patterns above the surface through a mixture of metal powder , lacquer , and charcoal or clay dust .",

  "/wiki/Kana": "Kana ( \u4eee\u540d , Japanese pronunciation : [ kana ] ) are the syllabaries that form parts of the Japanese writing system , contrasted with the logographic Chinese characters known in Japan as kanji ( \u6f22\u5b57 ) . The modern Japanese writing system makes use of two syllabaries : cursive hiragana ( \u3072\u3089\u304c\u306a ) and angular katakana ( \u30ab\u30bf\u30ab\u30ca ) . Also classified as kana is the ancient syllabic use of kanji known as man'y\u014dgana ( \u4e07\u8449\u4eee\u540d ) , which was ancestral to both hiragana and katakana . Hentaigana ( \u5909\u4f53\u4eee\u540d , variant kana ) are historical variants of modern standard hiragana . In modern Japanese , hiragana and katakana have directly corresponding sets of characters representing the same series of sounds . Katakana , with a few additions , are also used to write Ainu . Taiwanese kana were used in Taiwanese Hokkien as glosses ( furigana ) for Chinese characters in Taiwan under Japanese rule . Each kana character ( syllabogram ) corresponds to one sound in the Japanese language . Apart from the five vowels , this is always CV ( consonant onset with vowel nucleus ) , such as ka , ki , etc. , or V ( vowel ) , such as a , i , etc. , with the sole exception of the C grapheme for nasal codas usually romanised as n. This structure has led some scholars to label the system moraic instead of syllabic , because it requires the combination of two syllabograms to represent a CVC syllable with coda ( i.e . CVn , CVm , CVng ) , a CVV syllable with complex nucleus ( i.e . multiple or expressively long vowels ) , or a CCV syllable with complex onset ( i.e . including a glide , CyV , CwV ) .",

  "/wiki/Sh\u014d_(instrument)": "The sh\u014d ( \u7b19 ) is a Japanese free reed musical instrument that was introduced from China during the Nara period ( AD 710 to 794 ) . It is descended from the Chinese sheng , of the Tang Dynasty era , although the sh\u014d tends to be smaller in size than its contemporary sheng relatives . It consists of 17 slender bamboo pipes , each of which is fitted in its base with a metal free reed . Two of the pipes are silent , although research suggests that they were used in some music during the Heian period . The instrument 's sound is said to imitate the call of a phoenix , and it is for this reason that the two silent pipes of the sh\u014d are kept - as an aesthetic element , making two symmetrical wings . Similar to the Chinese sheng , the pipes are tuned carefully with a drop of a dense resinous wax preparation containing fine lead shot . As ( breath ) moisture collected in the sh\u014d 's pipes prevents it from sounding , performers can be seen warming the instrument over a small charcoal brazier or electric burner when they are not playing . The instrument produces sound when the player 's breath is inhaled or exhaled , allowing long periods of uninterrupted play . The sh\u014d is one of the three primary woodwind instruments used in gagaku , Japan 's imperial court music . Its traditional playing technique in gagaku involves the use of tone clusters called aitake ( \u5408\u7af9 ) , which move gradually from one to the other , providing accompaniment to the melody . A larger size of sh\u014d , called u ( derived from the Chinese yu ) , is little used , although some performers , such as Hiromi Yoshida and Ko Ishikawa , began to revive it in the late 20th century . A detailed book in English on the sh\u014d and the gagaku ( court orchestra music ) it is associated with is titled Music of a Thousand Autumns : The Togaku style of Japanese Court Music by Robert Garfias .",
