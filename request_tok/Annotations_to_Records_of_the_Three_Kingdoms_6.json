Along with the Zuo Zhuan and the Guliang Zhuan , the work is one of the Three Commentaries on the Spring and Autumn Annals . In particular , Gongyang Zhuan is a central work to New Text Confucianism ( \u4eca\u6587\u7d93\u5b78 ) , which advocates Confucius as an institutional reformer instead of a respected scholar , and Chunqiu as an embodiment of Confucius ' holistic vision on political , social , and moral issues instead of a merely chronicle . Gongyang Zhuan significantly influenced the political institution in Han Dynasty . It fell out of favor among elites and was eventually replaced by the Zuo Zhuan . Gongyang Zhuan scholarship was reinvigorated in late Ming Dynasty and became a major source of inspiration for Chinese reformers from eighteen to early twentieth century . Sima Qian states that Mencius , Gongsun Gu , Xunzi and Han Fei often drew on the Gongyang , while actually they drew on commentaries similar to what we now call the Zuozhuan ; for him the distinction was meaningless .",
  "/wiki/Spring_and_Autumn_Annals": "The Spring and Autumn Annals or Chunqiu is an ancient Chinese chronicle that has been one of the core Chinese classics since ancient times . The Annals is the official chronicle of the State of Lu , and covers a 241-year period from 722 to 481 BC . It is the earliest surviving Chinese historical text to be arranged in annals form . Because it was traditionally regarded as having been compiled by Confucius ( after a claim to this effect by Mencius ) , it was included as one of the Five Classics of Chinese literature . The Annals records main events that occurred in Lu during each year , such as the accessions , marriages , deaths , and funerals of rulers , battles fought , sacrificial rituals observed , celestial phenomena considered ritually important , and natural disasters . The entries are tersely written , averaging only 10 characters per entry , and contain no elaboration on events or recording of speeches . During the Warring States period ( 475-221 BC ) , a number of commentaries to the Annals were created that attempted to elaborate on or find deeper meaning in the brief entries in the Annals . The Commentary of Zuo ( Zuo zhuan \u5de6\u50b3 ) , the best known of these commentaries , became a classic in its own right , and is the source of more Chinese sayings and idioms than any other classical work .",

It comprises 30 chapters covering a period from 722 to 468 BC , and focuses mainly on political , diplomatic , and military affairs from that era . The Zuo zhuan is famous for its relentlessly realistic style , and recounts many tense and dramatic episodes , such as battles and fights , royal assassinations and murder of concubines , deception and intrigue , excesses , citizens ' oppression and insurgences , and appearances of ghosts and cosmic portents . For many centuries , the Zuo zhuan was the primary text through which educated Chinese gained an understanding of their ancient history . Unlike the other two surviving Annals commentaries - the Gongyang and Guliang commentaries - the Zuo zhuan does not simply explain the wording of the Annals , but greatly expounds upon its historical background , and contains a large number of rich and lively accounts of Spring and Autumn period ( 771-476 BC ) history and culture . The Zuo zhuan is the source of more Chinese sayings and idioms than any other classical work , and its concise , flowing style came to be held as a paragon of elegant Classical Chinese . Its tendency toward third-person narration and portraying characters through direct speech and action became hallmarks of Chinese narrative in general , and its style was imitated by historians , storytellers , and ancient style prose masters for over 2000 years of subsequent Chinese history . Although the Zuo zhuan has long been regarded as a masterpiece of grand historical narrative , its early textual history is largely unknown , and the nature of its original composition and authorship have been widely debated . The Zuo of the title was traditionally believed to refer to one Zuo Qiuming - an obscure figure of the 5th century BC described as a blind disciple of Confucius - but there is little actual evidence to support this . Most scholars now generally believe that the Zuo zhuan was originally an independent work composed during the 4th century BC that was later rearranged as a commentary to the Annals .",

Variously described as tradition , a philosophy , a religion , a humanistic or rationalistic religion , a way of governing , or simply a way of life , Confucianism developed from what was later called the Hundred Schools of Thought from the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius ( 551-479 BCE ) . Confucius considered himself a recodifier and retransmitter of the theology and values inherited from the Shang ( c. 1600-1046 BCE ) and Zhou dynasties ( c. 1046-256 BCE ) for the Warring States period . Confucianism was suppressed during the Legalist and autocratic Qin dynasty ( 221-206 BCE ) , but survived . During the Han dynasty ( 206 BCE-220 CE ) , Confucian approaches edged out the proto-Taoist Huang-Lao as the official ideology , while the emperors mixed both with the realist techniques of Legalism . A Confucian revival began during the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) . In the late Tang , Confucianism developed in response to Buddhism and Taoism and was reformulated as Neo-Confucianism . This reinvigorated form was adopted as the basis of the imperial exams and the core philosophy of the scholar official class in the Song dynasty ( 960-1297 ) . The abolition of the examination system in 1905 marked the end of official Confucianism . The intellectuals of the New Culture Movement of the early twentieth century blamed Confucianism for China 's weaknesses . They searched for new doctrines to replace Confucian teachings ; some of these new ideologies include the Three Principles of the People with the establishment of the Republic of China , and then Maoism under the People 's Republic of China .

Duke Huan was eventually recognized by most of the Zhou states as well as the Zhou royal family as Hegemon of China . In this position , he fought off invasions of China by non-Zhou peoples and attempted to restore order throughout the lands .

It is believed to have been written during the Warring States period ( 475-221 BC ) , and it achieved its final form during the mid-Han dynasty ( 206 BC-220 AD ) . By the early Han dynasty the Analects was considered merely a commentary on the Five Classics , but the status of the Analects grew to be one of the central texts of Confucianism by the end of that dynasty . During the late Song dynasty ( 960-1279 ) the importance of the Analects as a philosophy work was raised above that of the older Five Classics , and it was recognized as one of the Four Books . The Analects has been one of the most widely-read and studied books in China for the last 2,000 years , and continues to have a substantial influence on Chinese and East Asian thought and values today . Confucius believed that the welfare of a country depended on the moral cultivation of its people , beginning from the nation 's leadership . He believed that individuals could begin to cultivate an all-encompassing sense of virtue through ren , and that the most basic step to cultivating ren was devotion to one 's parents and older siblings . He taught that one 's individual desires do not need to be suppressed , but that people should be educated to reconcile their desires via rituals and forms of propriety , through which people could demonstrate their respect for others and their responsible roles in society .

His followers competed successfully with many other schools during the Hundred Schools of Thought era only to be suppressed in favor of the Legalists during the Qin dynasty .

For almost 1,500 years it was the lead text in an anthology that would be formalised as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080 . The Art of War remains the most influential strategy text in East Asian warfare and has influenced both Eastern and Western military thinking , business tactics , legal strategy , lifestyles and beyond . The book contained a detailed explanation and analysis of the Chinese military , from weapons and strategy to rank and discipline . Sun Tzu also stressed the importance of intelligence operatives and espionage to the war effort . Because Sun Tzu has long been considered to be one of history 's finest military tacticians and analysts , his teachings and strategies formed the basis of advanced military training for centuries to come .

The Zhuangzi consists of a large collection of anecdotes , allegories , parables , and fables , which are often humorous or irreverent in nature . Its main themes are of spontaneity in action and of freedom from the human world and its conventions . The fables and anecdotes in the text attempt to illustrate the falseness of human distinctions between good and bad , large and small , life and death , and human and nature . While other ancient Chinese philosophers focused on moral and personal duty , Zhuangzi promoted carefree wandering and becoming one with the Way ( D\u00e0o \u9053 ) by following nature . Though primarily known as a philosophical work , the Zhuangzi is regarded as one of the greatest literary works in all of Chinese history , and has been called the most important pre-Qin text for the study of Chinese literature . A masterpiece of both philosophical and literary skill , it has significantly influenced writers for more than 2000 years from the Han dynasty ( 206 BC-AD 220 ) to the present . Many major Chinese writers and poets in history - such as Sima Xiangru and Sima Qian during the Han dynasty , Ruan Ji and Tao Yuanming during the Six Dynasties ( 222-589 ) , Li Bai during the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) , and Su Shi and Lu You in the Song dynasty ( 960-1279 ) - were heavily influenced by the Zhuangzi .",
