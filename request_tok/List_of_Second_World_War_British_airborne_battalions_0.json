  "/wiki/1st_Parachute_Brigade": "The 1st Parachute Brigade was an airborne forces brigade formed by the British Army during the Second World War . As its name indicates , the unit was the first parachute infantry brigade formation in the British Army . Formed from three parachute battalions as well as support units and assigned to the 1st Airborne Division , the brigade first saw action in Operation Biting - a raid on a German radar site at Bruneval on the French coast . They were then deployed in the Torch landings in Algeria , and the following Tunisia Campaign , where it fought as an independent unit . In North Africa each of the brigade 's three parachute battalions took part in separate parachute assaults . The brigade then fought in the front line as normal infantry until the end of the campaign , during which they earned the nickname the Red Devils . Following the Axis surrender in North Africa , when 1st Airborne Division arrived in Tunisia the brigade once more came under its command . The brigade 's next mission was Operation Fustian , part of the Allied invasion of Sicily . This was also the British Army 's first brigade-sized combat parachute jump . Because of casualties sustained in Sicily , the brigade was held in reserve for the division 's next action , Operation Slapstick , an amphibious landing at Taranto in Italy . At the end of 1943 , the brigade returned to England , in preparation for the invasion of North-West Europe . Not required during the Normandy landings , the brigade was next in action at the Battle of Arnhem , part of Operation Market Garden .",
  "/wiki/1st_Airborne_Division": "The 1st Airborne Division was an airborne infantry division of the British Army during the Second World War . The division was formed in late 1941 during World War II , after the British Prime Minister , Winston Churchill , demanded an airborne force , and was initially under command of Major-General Frederick A. M. Browning . The division was one of two airborne divisions raised by the British Army during the war , with the other being the 6th Airborne Division , created in May 1943 , using former units of the 1st Airborne Division . The division 's first two missions - Operation Biting , a parachute landing in France , and Operation Freshman , a glider mission in Norway - were both raids . Part of the division was sent to North Africa at the end of 1942 , where it fought in the Tunisian Campaign , and when the Allies invaded Sicily in July 1943 , the division undertook two brigade sized landings . The first , Operation Ladbroke , carried out by glider infantry of the 1st Airlanding Brigade and the second , Operation Fustian , by the 1st Parachute Brigade , were far from completely successful . The 1st Airborne Division then took part in a mostly diversionary amphibious landing , codenamed Operation Slapstick , as part of the Allied invasion of Italy in September 1943 . In December , most of the 1st Airborne Division ( minus the 2nd Parachute Brigade ) returned to England , and began training and preparing for the Allied invasion of Normandy . It was not involved in the Normandy landings in June 1944 , being held in reserve . In September 1944 the 1st Airborne took part in Operation Market Garden . The division , with the Polish 1st Parachute Brigade temporarily attached , landed 60 miles ( 97 km ) behind German lines , to capture crossings on the River Rhine , and fought in the Battle of Arnhem . After failing to achieve its objectives , the division was surrounded and took very heavy casualties , but held out for nine days before the survivors were evacuated .",
  "/wiki/Operation_Torch": "Operation Torch ( 8-16 November 1942 ) was an Anglo-American invasion of French North Africa during the Second World War . The French colonies in the area were dominated by the Vichy French , formally aligned with Germany but of mixed loyalties . Reports indicated that they might support the Allies . The American General Dwight D. Eisenhower , commanding the operation , planned a three-pronged attack on Casablanca ( Western ) , Oran ( Center ) and Algiers ( Eastern ) , then a rapid move on Tunis . The Western Task Force encountered unexpected resistance and bad weather , but Casablanca , the principal French Atlantic naval base , was captured after a short siege . The Center Task Force suffered some damage to its ships when trying to land in shallow water but the Vichy French ships were sunk or driven off ; Oran surrendered after bombardment by British battleships . The Eastern Task Force met less opposition because the French Resistance had staged a coup in Algiers and the Allies were able to push inland and compel surrender on the first day . The success of Torch caused Admiral Fran\u00e7ois Darlan , commander of the Vichy French forces to order co-operation with the Allies , in return for being retained as High Commissioner , with many other Vichy officials keeping their jobs . Darlan was assassinated soon after and the Free French gradually came to dominate the government . Torch was the first mass involvement of US troops in the European-North African Theatre , and saw the first major airborne assault carried out by the United States .",
  "/wiki/Operation_Fustian": "Operation Fustian was an airborne forces operation undertaken during the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943 in the Second World War . The operation was carried out by Brigadier Gerald Lathbury 's 1st Parachute Brigade , part of the British 1st Airborne Division . Their objective was the Primosole Bridge across the Simeto River . The intention was for the brigade , with glider-borne forces in support , to land on both sides of the river . They would then capture the bridge and secure the surrounding area until relieved by the advance of British XIII Corps , which had landed on the south eastern coast three days previously . Because the bridge was the only crossing on the river and would give the British Eighth Army access to the Catania plain , its capture was expected to speed the advance and lead to the defeat of the Axis forces in Sicily . Many of the aircraft carrying the paratroopers from North Africa were shot down or were damaged and turned back by friendly fire and enemy action . Evasive action taken by the pilots scattered the brigade over a large area and only the equivalent of two companies of troops were landed in the correct locations . Despite this and the defence by German and Italian forces , the British paratroops captured the bridge , repulsed attacks and held out against increasing odds until nightfall . The relief force led by the 50th ( Northumbrian ) Infantry Division , under Major-General Sidney C. Kirkman , which was short of transport , were still 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) away when they halted for the night . By this time , with casualties mounting and supplies running short , the parachute brigade commander , Gerald Lathbury , had relinquished control of the bridge to the Germans . The following day the British units joined forces and the 9th Battalion , Durham Light Infantry , with tank support , attempted to recapture the bridge .",
  "/wiki/Operation_Slapstick": "Operation Slapstick was the code name for a British landing from the sea at the Italian port of Taranto during the Second World War . The operation , one of three landings during the Allied invasion of Italy in September 1943 , was undertaken by airborne troops of the British 1st Airborne Division , commanded by Major-General George Hopkinson . Planned at short notice , the mission followed an offer by the Italian government to open the ports of Taranto and Brindisi on the heel of Italy to the Allies . The airborne division was selected to undertake the mission , but at the time they were located in North Africa . A shortage of transport aircraft meant the division could not land in their traditional way by parachute and glider , and all the landing craft in the area were already allocated to the other landings : Operation Avalanche at Salerno on the western coast , and Operation Baytown at Calabria . Instead , the division had to be transported across the Mediterranean by ships of the Royal Navy . The landing was unopposed and the airborne division successfully captured the ports of Taranto , and later Brindisi on the Adriatic coast in working order . The only German forces in the area were elements of the 1st Parachute Division ( 1 . Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Division ) , [ note 1 ] which engaged the advancing British in ambushes and at roadblocks during a fighting withdrawal north . Eventually , by the end of September , the British 1st Airborne Division advanced 125 miles ( 201 km ) to Foggia . Reinforcements from two infantry divisions had by then been landed behind them , which allowed the airborne troops to be withdrawn to Taranto . Soon after , the division , minus the 2nd Parachute Brigade , sailed for England in preparation for Operation Overlord , the invasion of Normandy .",
  "/wiki/Operation_Market_Garden": "Operation Market Garden was a failed World War II military operation fought in the Netherlands from 17 to 25 September 1944 . It was the brainchild of Field Marshal Sir Bernard Law Montgomery , planned primarily by Generals Brereton and Williams of the USAAF . The airborne part of the operation was undertaken by the First Allied Airborne Army with the land operation by XXX Corps of the British Second Army . The objective was to create a 64 mi ( 103 km ) salient into German territory with a bridgehead over the River Rhine , creating an Allied invasion route into northern Germany . This was to be achieved by seizing a series of nine bridges by Airborne forces with land forces swiftly following over the bridges . The operation succeeded in liberating the Dutch cities of Eindhoven and Nijmegen along with many towns , creating a 60 mi ( 97 km ) salient into German-held territory limiting V-2 rocket launching sites . It failed , however , to secure a bridgehead over the Rhine , with the advance being halted at the river . Market Garden consisted of two sub operations :",

The brigade was formed in late 1941 during World War II through the conversion of an existing infantry brigade previously stationed in India , the 31st Independent Infantry Brigade . Two of the initial four infantry battalions left in May 1943 to form the new 6th Airlanding Brigade of the 6th Airborne Division and were replaced by a single new battalion , thereby reducing the brigade 's strength by one quarter . The brigade only saw action on two occasions during the Second World War , in Operation Ladbroke , as part of the Allied invasion of Sicily , in July 1943 and later in Operation Market Garden in September 1944 . During the second operation , in the fighting around Arnhem , 1st Airlanding Brigade along with the rest of 1st Airborne Division held out against overwhelming German odds , sustaining very heavy losses . Only around 20 percent of the brigade were evacuated south of the River Rhine . The rest had either been killed , were missing or became prisoners of war . Following the German surrender in mid-1945 , 1st Airlanding Brigade were sent to Norway to disarm the German garrison . Later the same year the brigade was disbanded .",
  "/wiki/Operation_Ladbroke": "Operation Ladbroke was a glider landing by British airborne troops during the Second World War near Syracuse , Sicily , that began on 9 July 1943 as part of Operation Husky , the Allied invasion of Sicily . The first Allied mission using large numbers of the aircraft , the operation was carried out from Tunisia by glider infantry of the British 1st Airlanding Brigade , commanded by Brigadier Philip Hicks , with a force of 136 Waco Hadrians and eight Airspeed Horsas . The objective was to establish a large invasion force on the ground near the town of Syracuse , secure the Ponte Grande Bridge and ultimately take control of the city itself with its strategically vital docks , as a prelude to the full-scale invasion of Sicily . En route to Sicily , sixty-five gliders released too early by the American and British towing aircraft crashed into the sea , drowning approximately 252 men . Of the remainder , only eighty-seven men arrived at the Pont Grande Bridge , although they successfully captured the bridge and held it beyond the time they were to be relieved . Finally , with their ammunition expended and only fifteen soldiers remaining unwounded , the Allied troops surrendered to Italian forces . The Italians , having gained control of the bridge , sought to destroy the structure , but were frustrated by troopers of the 1st Airlanding Brigade who had removed the previously attached explosive charges . Other troops from the brigade , who had landed elsewhere in Sicily , aided further by destroying communications links and capturing gun batteries .",

  "/wiki/Operation_Tonga": "Operation Tonga was the codename given to the airborne operation undertaken by the British 6th Airborne Division between 5 June and 7 June 1944 as a part of Operation Overlord and the D-Day landings during World War II . The paratroopers and glider-borne airborne troops of the division , commanded by Major-General Richard Nelson Gale , landed on the eastern flank of the invasion area , near to the city of Caen , tasked with a number of objectives . The division was to capture two strategically important bridges over the Caen Canal and Orne River which were to be used by Allied ground forces to advance once the seaborne landings had taken place , destroy several other bridges to deny their use to the Germans and secure several important villages . The division was also assigned the task of assaulting and destroying the Merville Gun Battery , an artillery battery that Allied intelligence believed housed a number of heavy artillery pieces , which could bombard the nearest invasion beach ( codenamed Sword ) and possibly inflict heavy casualties on the Allied troops landing on it . Having achieved these objectives , the division was then to create and secure a bridgehead focused around the captured bridges until they linked up with advancing Allied ground forces . The division suffered from a combination of bad weather and poor pilot navigation , which caused many of the airborne troops to be dropped inaccurately throughout the divisional operational area causing a number of casualties and making conducting operations much more difficult . In particular , the 9th Parachute Battalion , which was assigned the task of destroying the Merville artillery battery , was only able to gather up a fraction of its strength before it had to attack the battery , with the result that the depleted force suffered heavy casualties . However , the battery was successfully assaulted and the guns inside it disabled . The division 's other objectives were also achieved despite the problems encountered . A small force of glider-borne troops , from the 2nd Battalion Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry , secured two bridges over the Caen Canal and River Orne in a coup-de-main operation . The other bridges were destroyed by the division , and a number of villages were occupied . A bridgehead was formed by the division , and it successfully repulsed a number of German counter-attacks until Allied ground forces from the invasion beaches reached its positions .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bulge": "The Battle of the Bulge , also known as the Ardennes Counteroffensive , was the last major German offensive campaign on the Western Front during World War II , and took place from 16 December 1944 to 25 January 1945 . It was launched through the densely forested Ardennes region of Wallonia in eastern Belgium , northeast France , and Luxembourg , towards the end of the war in Europe . The offensive was intended to stop Allied use of the Belgian port of Antwerp and to split the Allied lines , allowing the Germans to encircle and destroy four Allied armies and force the Western Allies to negotiate a peace treaty in the Axis powers ' favor . The Germans achieved a total surprise attack on the morning of 16 December 1944 , due to a combination of Allied overconfidence , preoccupation with Allied offensive plans , and poor aerial reconnaissance due to bad weather . American forces bore the brunt of the attack and incurred their highest casualties of any operation during the war . The battle also severely depleted Germany 's armored forces , and they were largely unable to replace them . German personnel and , later , Luftwaffe aircraft ( in the concluding stages of the engagement ) also sustained heavy losses . The Germans had attacked a weakly defended section of the Allied line , taking advantage of heavily overcast weather conditions that grounded the Allies ' overwhelmingly superior air forces . Fierce resistance on the northern shoulder of the offensive , around Elsenborn Ridge , and in the south , around Bastogne , blocked German access to key roads to the northwest and west that they counted on for success . Columns of armor and infantry that were supposed to advance along parallel routes found themselves on the same roads . This , and terrain that favored the defenders , threw the German advance behind schedule and allowed the Allies to reinforce the thinly placed troops . The farthest west the offensive reached was the village of Foy-N\u00f4tre-Dame , south east of Dinant , being stopped by the U.S. 2nd Armored Division on 24 December 1944 .",
  "/wiki/Operation_Varsity": "Operation Varsity ( 24 March 1945 ) was a successful airborne forces operation launched by Allied troops that took place toward the end of World War II . Involving more than 16,000 paratroopers and several thousand aircraft , it was the largest airborne operation in history to be conducted on a single day and in one location . [ Note 5 ] Varsity was part of Operation Plunder , the Anglo-American-Canadian assault under Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery to cross the northern Rhine River and from there enter Northern Germany . Varsity was meant to help the surface river assault troops secure a foothold across the Rhine River in Western Germany by landing two airborne divisions on the eastern bank of the Rhine near the village of Hamminkeln and the town of Wesel . The plans called for the dropping of two divisions from U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps , under Major General Matthew B. Ridgway , to capture key territory and to generally disrupt German defenses to aid the advance of Allied ground forces . The British 6th Airborne Division was ordered to capture the villages of Schnappenberg and Hamminkeln , clear part of the Diersfordter Wald ( Diersfordt Forest ) of German forces , and secure three bridges over the River Issel . The U.S. 17th Airborne Division was to capture the village of Diersfordt and clear the rest of the Diersfordter Wald of any remaining German forces . The two divisions would hold the territory they had captured until relieved by advancing units of 21st Army Group , and then join in the general advance into northern Germany . The airborne forces made several mistakes , most notably when pilot error caused paratroopers from the 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment , a regiment of the U.S. 17th Airborne Division , to miss their drop zone and land on a British drop zone instead . However , the operation was a success , with both divisions capturing Rhine bridges and securing towns that could have been used by Germany to delay the advance of the British ground forces . The two divisions incurred more than 2,000 casualties , but captured about 3,500 German soldiers . The operation was the last large-scale Allied airborne operation of World War II .",

  "/wiki/Operation_Biting": "Operation Biting , also known as the Bruneval Raid , was a British Combined Operations raid on a German coastal radar installation at Bruneval in northern France during the Second World War , on the night of 27-28 February 1942 . Several of these installations were identified from Royal Air Force ( RAF ) aerial reconnaissance photographs during 1941 , but their exact purpose and the nature of the equipment that they possessed was not known . Some British scientists believed that these stations were connected with the heavy losses being experienced by RAF bombers conducting bombing raids against targets in Occupied Europe . The scientists requested that one of these installations be raided and the technology it possessed be studied and , if possible , extracted and brought back to Britain for further examination . Due to the extensive coastal defences erected by the Germans to protect the installation from a seaborne raid , it was believed that a commando raid from the sea would suffer heavy losses and give sufficient time for the enemy to destroy the installation . It was therefore decided that an airborne assault followed by seaborne evacuation would be the most practicable way to surprise the garrison of the installation , seize the technology intact , and minimise casualties to the raiding force . On the night of 27 February , after a period of intense training and several delays due to poor weather , a company of airborne troops under the command of Major John Frost parachuted into France a few miles from the installation . The main force then assaulted the villa in which the radar equipment was kept , killing several members of the German garrison and capturing the installation after a brief firefight . An RAF technician with the force dismantled a W\u00fcrzburg radar array and removed several key pieces , after which the force withdrew to the evacuation beach . The detachment assigned to clear the beach had initially failed to do so , but the German force guarding it was soon eliminated with the help of the main force . The raiding troops were picked up by landing craft , then transferred to several Motor Gun Boats which returned them to Britain . The raid was entirely successful .",

  "/wiki/Operation_Freshman": "Operation Freshman was the codename given to a British airborne operation conducted in November 1942 during World War II . It was the first British airborne operation conducted using Airspeed Horsa gliders , and its target was the Vemork Norsk Hydro chemical plant in Telemark , Norway which produced heavy water for Nazi Germany . By 1942 , the German nuclear weapons programme had come close to being able to develop a nuclear reactor , but in order for the reactor to function it would require a great deal of heavy water . The source of the heavy water was the Norsk Hydro plant , which had been occupied in 1940 ; when the British government learned of the German nuclear developments , it was decided that a raid would be launched to destroy the plant and deny the Germans the heavy water required to develop a nuclear weapon . Several tactics were discussed and discarded as impractical , and it was finally decided that a small airborne force composed of sappers from the Royal Engineer units attached to 1st Airborne Division would land by glider a short distance from the plant , demolish it with explosives and then escape over the Norwegian border into Sweden . After a period of extensive training , the airborne force took off in two aircraft-glider combinations on the night of 19 November 1942 . Both managed to reach the Norwegian coast , but neither was able to reach their objective . The first pair suffered from navigational difficulties and severe weather , which resulted in the tow rope snapping and the first glider crash-landing , with its Halifax tug aircraft returning to base ; three airborne troops were killed outright , with the survivors captured shortly after the crash . The second pair fared even worse , with both aircraft and glider crashing into a mountain for unknown reasons ; the aircrew and some airborne troops were killed outright , and those who survived were taken prisoner . None survived for very long , being executed as a result of Adolf Hitler 's Commando Order , which stated all Commando personnel were to be immediately executed upon capture . At the end of the war , Wehrmacht personnel were tried and condemned to death for their part in the executions .",

Largely unopposed , the brigade captured the ports of Brindisi and Bari before being withdrawn . By the end of the year , the 4th Parachute Brigade was in England , preparing for the Allied invasion of North-West Europe . The brigade did not see action in France , being instead placed on standby for an emergency during the Normandy landings . Between June and August 1944 the speed of the subsequent Allied advance obviated the need to deploy airborne forces . In September 1944 , the brigade formed part of the second day 's parachute landings at the Battle of Arnhem , part of Operation Market Garden . Problems reaching the bridges in Arnhem forced the divisional commander , Major-General Roy Urquhart , to divert one of the brigade 's battalions to assist the 1st Parachute Brigade .

Instead the brigade was assigned to the 6th Airborne Division , which had been named the Imperial Strategic Reserve , and sent to serve in the Mandate of Palestine . Defence cuts in the British armed forces after the war forced a reduction in the number of parachute brigades .

The airborne task force landed in the River Argens valley with the objective of preventing German reinforcements from reaching the landing beaches . The landings were mainly an American operation and the brigade was the only British Army formation involved . The brigade 's pathfinders landed accurately and set up their homing beacons , but the main body of the brigade landed over a large area , some 20 miles ( 32 km ) away . The following glider force also had problems ; weather conditions forced the brigade 's anti-tank unit to turn back for Italy and return with the second wave later that day . Eventually the brigade captured their primary objectives , but the lack of manpower meant that their secondary objective of Le Muy was given to the American airborne forces . The seaborne and airborne landings linked up within two days , and the brigade became the reserve formation for the operation . As a British withdrawal from France at the earliest opportunity had been the original intent , the brigade boarded ships bound for Italy eleven days after landing . The operation had cost the brigade 362 casualties , but this did not hinder their next mission in Greece two months later .
