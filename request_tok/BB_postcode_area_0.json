First , one or two letters indicate the postcode area , followed by one or two digits signifying a district within that area . This is followed by a space and then a number denoting a sector within said district , and finally by two letters which are allocated to streets or sides of a street . Postcode areas are often named for a major town or city ( such as B for Birmingham ) but may also be geographic in nature ( such as HS for Outer Hebrides ) .
