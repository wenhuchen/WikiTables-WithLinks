The same word is also used in Sanskrit origin for a tortoise . The Rann is known for its marshy salt flats which become snow white after the shallow water dries up each season before the monsoon rains . The district is also known for ecologically important Banni grasslands with their seasonal marshy wetlands which form the outer belt of the Rann of Kutch . Kutch District is surrounded by the Gulf of Kutch and the Arabian Sea in south and west , while the northern and eastern parts are surrounded by the Great and Little Rann ( seasonal wetlands ) of Kutch .
