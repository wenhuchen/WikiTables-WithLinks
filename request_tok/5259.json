Consequently , it is sometimes considered an example of the New French Extremity .

Born and raised in La Goulette , a neighbourhood of Tunis , Cardinale won the Most Beautiful Italian Girl in Tunisia competition in 1957 , the prize being a trip to Italy , which quickly led to film contracts , due above all to the involvement of Franco Cristaldi , who acted as her mentor for a number of years and later married her .
