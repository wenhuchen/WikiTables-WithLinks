  "/wiki/Hal_Jordan": "Hal Jordan , also known as Green Lantern , is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics . The character was created in 1959 by writer John Broome and artist Gil Kane , and first appeared in Showcase # 22 ( October 1959 ) . Hal Jordan is a reinvention of the previous Green Lantern who appeared in 1940s comic books as the character Alan Scott . Hal Jordan is a fighter pilot , a member and occasionally leader of an intergalactic police force called the Green Lantern Corps , as well as a founding member of the Justice League , DC 's flagship superhero team , alongside well-known heroes such as Batman , Superman , and Wonder Woman . He fights evil across the universe with a ring that grants him a variety of superpowers , but is usually portrayed as one of the protectors of Sector 2814 , which is the sector where Earth resides . His powers derive from his power ring and Green Lantern battery , which in the hands of someone capable of overcoming great fear allows the user to channel their will power into creating all manner of fantastic constructs . Jordan uses this power to fly , even through the vacuum of space ; to create shields , swords , and lasers ; and to construct his Green Lantern costume , which protects his secret identity in his civilian life on Earth . Jordan and all other Green Lanterns are monitored and empowered by the mysterious Guardians of the Universe , who were developed from an idea editor Julius Schwartz and Broome had originally conceived years prior in a story featuring Captain Comet in Strange Adventures # 22 ( July 1952 ) entitled Guardians of the Clockwork Universe . During the 1990s , Jordan also appeared as a villain . The story line Emerald Twilight saw a Jordan traumatized by the supervillain Mongul 's destruction of Jordan 's hometown Coast City , adopt the name Parallax , and threaten to destroy the universe . In subsequent years , DC Comics rehabilitated the character , first by having Jordan seek redemption for his actions as Parallax , and later by revealing that Parallax was in fact an evil cosmic entity that corrupted Jordan and took control of his actions . Between the character 's stint as Parallax and his return to DC Comics as a heroic Green Lantern once more , the character also briefly served as the Spectre , a supernatural character in DC Comics stories who acts as God 's wrathful agent on Earth .",

In the 1980s he pursued the development of Marvel properties in other media , with mixed results . Following his retirement from Marvel in the 1990s , he remained a public figurehead for the company , and frequently made cameo appearances in films and television shows based on Marvel characters , on which he received an executive producer credit .

He is the alter ego of Billy Batson , a boy who , by speaking the magic word SHAZAM ! ( acronym of six immortal elders : Solomon , Hercules , Atlas , Zeus , Achilles , and Mercury ) , can transform himself into a costumed adult with the powers of superhuman strength , speed , flight and other abilities . The character battles an extensive rogues ' gallery , primarily archenemies Doctor Sivana , Black Adam , and Mister Mind . Based on book selling points , the character was the most popular superhero of the 1940s , outselling even Superman . Fawcett expanded the franchise to include other Marvels , primarily Marvel Family associates Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel Jr. , who can harness powers similar to Billy 's . Captain Marvel was also the first comic book superhero to be adapted into film , in a 1941 Republic Pictures serial , Adventures of Captain Marvel , with Tom Tyler as Captain Marvel and Frank Coghlan , Jr. as Billy Batson . Fawcett ceased publishing Captain Marvel-related comics in 1953 , partly because of a copyright infringement suit from DC Comics alleging that Captain Marvel was a copy of Superman .

After Burton was hired as director in 1986 , Steve Englehart and Julie Hickson wrote film treatments before Sam Hamm wrote the first screenplay . Batman was not greenlit until after the success of Burton 's Beetlejuice ( 1988 ) . Numerous A-list actors were considered for the role of Batman before Keaton was cast . Keaton 's casting caused a controversy since , by 1988 , he had become typecast as a comedic actor and many observers doubted he could portray a serious role . Nicholson accepted the role of the Joker under strict conditions that dictated top billing , a portion of the film 's earnings ( including associated merchandise ) , and his own shooting schedule . The tone and themes of the film were influenced in part by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland 's The Killing Joke and Frank Miller 's The Dark Knight Returns . The film primarily adapts the Red Hood origin story for the Joker , in which Batman inadvertently creates the Joker by causing him to fall into Axis Chemical acid , resulting in his transformation into a psychopath , but it adds a unique twist in presenting him specifically as a gangster named Jack Napier .
