Small forwards are typically shorter , quicker , and leaner than power forwards and centers , but typically taller , larger and stronger than either of the guard positions .

Many small forwards in professional basketball are prolific scorers . The styles with which small forwards amass their points vary widely . Some players at the position are very accurate shooters , others prefer to initiate physical contact with opposing players , and still others are primarily slashers who also possess jump shots . In some cases , small forwards position on the baseline or as off-the-ball specialists . Small forwards who are defensive specialists are very versatile as they can often guard multiple positions using their size , speed , and strength .

  "/wiki/Point_guard": "The point guard ( PG ) , also called the one or point , is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game . A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position . Point guards are expected to run the team 's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time . Above all , the point guard must understand and accept their coach 's game plan ; in this way , the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football , a catcher in baseball or a playmaker in soccer ( association football ) . They must also be able to adapt to what the defense is allowing and must control the pace of the game . A point guard , like other player positions in basketball , specializes in certain skills . Their primary job is to facilitate scoring opportunities for their team , or sometimes for themselves . Lee Rose has described a point guard as a coach on the floor , who can handle and distribute the ball to teammates . This involves setting up plays on the court , getting the ball to the teammate in the best position to score , and controlling the tempo of the game . A point guard should know when and how to instigate a fast break and when and how to initiate the more deliberate sets . Point guards are expected to be vocal floor leaders . A point guard needs always to have in mind the times on the shot clock and the game clock , the score , the numbers of remaining timeouts for both teams , etc .",

A player who can switch between playing shooting guard and small forward is known as a swingman . In the NBA , shooting guards usually range from 6 ' 2 ( 1.88 m ) to 6 ' 7 ( 2.01 m ) , and from 5 ' 8 ( 1.73 m ) to 5 ' 11 ( 1.80 m ) in the WNBA .",

  "/wiki/Center_(basketball)": "The center ( C ) , also known as the five position , or the big man , is one of the five positions in a basketball game .

In the NBA , the center is usually 6 feet 10 inches ( 2.08 m ) or taller and usually weighs 240 pounds ( 110 kg ) or more . They traditionally have played close to the basket in the low post . Centers are valued for their ability to protect their own goal while scoring with high efficiency . In the 1950s and 1960s , George Mikan and Bill Russell were centerpieces of championship dynasties and defined early prototypical centers . With the addition of a three-point field goal for the 1979-80 season , however , NBA basketball gradually became more perimeter-oriented and saw the importance of the center position diminished . A center with the ability to shoot outside from three-point range is known as stretch five .",
