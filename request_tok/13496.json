  "/wiki/Track_and_field_athletics": "Track and field is a sport which includes athletic contests established on the skills of running , jumping , and throwing . The name is derived from where the sport takes place , a running track and a grass field for the throwing and some of the jumping events . Track and field is categorized under the umbrella sport of athletics , which also includes road running , cross country running , and racewalking . The foot racing events , which include sprints , middle- and long-distance events , racewalking and hurdling , are won by the athlete who completes it in the least time . The jumping and throwing events are won by those who achieve the greatest distance or height . Regular jumping events include long jump , triple jump , high jump and pole vault , while the most common throwing events are shot put , javelin , discus and hammer . There are also combined events or multi events , such as the pentathlon consisting of five events , heptathlon consisting of seven events , and decathlon consisting of ten events . In these , athletes participate in a combination of track and field events . Most track and field events are individual sports with a single victor ; the most prominent team events are relay races , which typically feature teams of four . Events are almost exclusively divided by gender , although both the men 's and women 's competitions are usually held at the same venue . If a race has too many people to run all at once , preliminary heats will be run to narrow down the field of participants . Track and field is one of the oldest sports .",

  "/wiki/Cycling": "Cycling , also called biking or bicycling , is the use of bicycles for transport , recreation , exercise or sport . People engaged in cycling are referred to as cyclists , bikers , or less commonly , as bicyclists . Apart from two-wheeled bicycles , cycling also includes the riding of unicycles , tricycles , quadracycles , recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles ( HPVs ) . Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number approximately one billion worldwide . They are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world . Cycling is widely regarded as a very effective and efficient mode of transportation optimal for short to moderate distances . Bicycles provide numerous benefits in comparison with motor vehicles , including the sustained physical exercise involved in cycling , easier parking , increased maneuverability , and access to roads , bike paths and rural trails . Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels , less air or noise pollution , and much reduced traffic congestion . These lead to less financial cost to the user as well as to society at large ( negligible damage to roads , less road area required ) . By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses , transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve . In addition , cycling provides a variety of health benefits . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) states that cycling can reduce the risk of cancers , heart disease , and diabetes that are prevalent in sedentary lifestyles .",

  "/wiki/Sailing": "Sailing employs the wind - acting on sails , wingsails or kites - to propel a craft on the surface of the water ( sailing ship , sailboat , windsurfer , or kitesurfer ) , on ice ( iceboat ) or on land ( land yacht ) over a chosen course , which is often part of a larger plan of navigation . A course defined with respect to the true wind direction is called a point of sail . Conventional sailing craft can not derive power from sails on a point of sail that is too close into the wind . On a given point of sail , the sailor adjusts the alignment of each sail with respect to the apparent wind direction ( as perceived on the craft ) to mobilize the power of the wind . The forces transmitted via the sails are resisted by forces from the hull , keel , and rudder of a sailing craft , by forces from skate runners of an iceboat , or by forces from wheels of a land sailing craft to allow steering the course . In the 21st century , most sailing represents a form of recreation or sport . Recreational sailing or yachting can be divided into racing and cruising . Cruising can include extended offshore and ocean-crossing trips , coastal sailing within sight of land , and daysailing . Until the mid of the 19th century , sailing ships were the primary means for marine commerce , this period is known as Age of Sail .",

  "/wiki/Table_Tennis": "Table tennis , also known as ping-pong , is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball back and forth across a table using small rackets . The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net . Except for the initial serve , the rules are generally as follows : players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table , and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once . A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules . Play is fast and demands quick reactions . Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent 's options , giving the hitter a great advantage . Table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation ( ITTF ) , founded in 1926 . ITTF currently includes 226 member associations . The table tennis official rules are specified in the ITTF handbook . Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988 , with several event categories .
