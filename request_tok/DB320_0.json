  "/wiki/Seventeenth_dynasty_of_Egypt": "The Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt ( notated Dynasty XVII , alternatively 17th Dynasty or Dynasty 17 ) is classified as the third dynasty of the Second Intermediate Period of Egypt . The 17th Dynasty dates approximately from 1580 to 1550 BC . Its mainly Theban rulers are contemporary with the Hyksos of the Fifteenth Dynasty and succeed the Sixteenth Dynasty , which was also based in Thebes . In March 2012 , French archeologists examining a limestone door in the Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak discovered hieroglyphs with the name Senakhtenre , the first evidence of this king dating to his lifetime . The last two kings of the dynasty opposed the Hyksos rule over Egypt and initiated a war that would rid Egypt of the Hyksos kings and began a period of unified rule , the New Kingdom of Egypt . Kamose , the second son of Seqenenre Tao and last king of the Seventeenth Dynasty , was the brother of Ahmose I , the first king of the Eighteenth Dynasty .",

  "/wiki/Seqenenre_Tao": "Seqenenre Tao ( also Seqenera Djehuty-aa or Sekenenra Taa ) , called 'the Brave ' , ruled over the last of the local kingdoms of the Theban region of Egypt in the Seventeenth Dynasty during the Second Intermediate Period . He probably was the son and successor to Senakhtenre Ahmose and Queen Tetisheri . The dates of his reign are uncertain , but he may have risen to power in the decade ending in 1560 BC or in 1558 BC ( based on the probable accession date of his son , Ahmose I , the first ruler of the eighteenth dynasty , see Egyptian chronology ) . With his queen , Ahhotep I , Seqenenre Tao fathered two pharaohs , Kamose , his immediate successor who was the last pharaoh of the seventeenth dynasty , and Ahmose I who , following a regency by his mother , was the first pharaoh of the eighteenth . Seqenenre Tao is credited with starting the opening moves in a war of revanchism against Hyksos incursions into Egypt , which saw the country completely liberated during the reign of his son Ahmose I .",
  "/wiki/Pharaoh": "Pharaoh is the common title of the monarchs of ancient Egypt from the First Dynasty ( c. 3150 BCE ) until the annexation of Egypt by the Roman Empire in 30 BCE , although the actual term Pharaoh was not used contemporaneously for a ruler until Merneptah , c. 1200 BCE . In the early dynasty , ancient Egyptian kings used to have up to three titles , the Horus , the Sedge and Bee ( nswt-bjtj ) name , and the Two Ladies ( nbtj ) name . The Golden Horus and nomen and prenomen titles were later added . In Egyptian society , religion was central to everyday life . One of the roles of the pharaoh was as an intermediary between the gods and the people . The pharaoh thus deputised for the gods ; his role was both as civil and religious administrator . He owned all of the land in Egypt , enacted laws , collected taxes , and defended Egypt from invaders as the commander-in-chief of the army . Religiously , the pharaoh officiated over religious ceremonies and chose the sites of new temples . He was responsible for maintaining Maat ( m\ua723\ua725t ) , or cosmic order , balance , and justice , and part of this included going to war when necessary to defend the country or attacking others when it was believed that this would contribute to Maat , such as to obtain resources . During the early days prior to the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt , the Deshret or the Red Crown , was a representation of the kingdom of Lower Egypt , while the Hedjet , the White Crown , was worn by the kings of the kingdom of Upper Egypt . After the unification of both kingdoms into one united Egypt , the Pschent , the combination of both the red and white crowns was the official crown of kings . With time new headdresses were introduced during different dynasties like the Khat , Nemes , Atef , Hemhem crown , and Khepresh .",

She is also called Ahmose-Meritamun , Ahmose-Meryetamun or just Meryetamun . Her mummy was found in the Deir el-Bahri cache ( DB320 ) and is now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo . The shroud covering her body gives her name and titles as the royal daughter , the royal sister Meritamon . Gaston Maspero had doubts about the identity of the mummy , but Grafton Elliot Smith points out in his description of the royal mummies that the method of mummification is consistent with that of the 18th Dynasty . The remains are those of an old woman who was relatively short in stature . The examination of her mummy shows that she suffered a head wound prior to her death which has the characteristics of wound sustained when falling backwards . The body was badly damaged by tomb robbers . She is not to be confused with her niece Ahmose-Meritamon , who became the wife of Amenhotep I .",

  "/wiki/Eighteenth_dynasty_of_Egypt": "The Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt ( notated Dynasty XVIII , alternatively 18th Dynasty or Dynasty 18 ) is classified as the first dynasty of the New Kingdom of Egypt , the era in which ancient Egypt achieved the peak of its power . The Eighteenth Dynasty spanned the period from 1549/1550 to 1292 BC . This dynasty is also known as the Thutmosid Dynasty for the four pharaohs named Thutmose . Several of Egypt 's most famous pharaohs were from the Eighteenth Dynasty , including Tutankhamun , whose tomb was found by Howard Carter in 1922 . Other famous pharaohs of the dynasty include Hatshepsut ( c. 1479 BC-1458 BC ) , the longest-reigning woman pharaoh of an indigenous dynasty , and Akhenaten ( c. 1353-1336 BC ) , the heretic pharaoh , with his Great Royal Wife , Nefertiti . The Eighteenth Dynasty is unique among Egyptian dynasties in that it had two women who ruled as sole pharaoh : Hatshepsut , who is regarded as one of the most innovative rulers of ancient Egypt , and Neferneferuaten , usually identified as the iconic Nefertiti .",

He was a member of the Theban royal house , the son of pharaoh Seqenenre Tao and brother of the last pharaoh of the Seventeenth dynasty , Kamose . During the reign of his father or grandfather , Thebes rebelled against the Hyksos , the rulers of Lower Egypt . When he was seven years old , his father was killed , and he was about ten when his brother died of unknown causes after reigning only three years . Ahmose I assumed the throne after the death of his brother , and upon coronation became known as nb-p\u1e25tj-r\ua725 The Lord of Strength is Ra . During his reign , Ahmose completed the conquest and expulsion of the Hyksos from the Nile Delta , restored Theban rule over the whole of Egypt and successfully reasserted Egyptian power in its formerly subject territories of Nubia and Canaan . He then reorganized the administration of the country , reopened quarries , mines and trade routes and began massive construction projects of a type that had not been undertaken since the time of the Middle Kingdom . This building program culminated in the construction of the last pyramid built by native Egyptian rulers . Ahmose 's reign laid the foundations for the New Kingdom , under which Egyptian power reached its peak . His reign is usually dated to the mid-16th century BC .",

Her mummified remains were discovered in a Theban tomb in 1881 and she is estimated to have been in her 30s at the time of her death . The mummy was unwrapped by Grafton Elliot Smith in 1909 . He distinguished her mummy as the most perfect example of embalming that has come down to us from the time of the early 18'th Dynasty , or perhaps even of any period . He further characterized her as the least unlovely of the existing female mummies , and described as a slim , gracefully-built woman , measuring 1m 510mm in height , with small childlike hands . In 2009 , a CAT scan by a medical team revealed Lady Rai had a diseased aortic arch and is thus the oldest known mummy with evidence of atherosclerosis . The mummy of Ahmose Inhapy , a princess and queen of the late 17th dynasty of Egypt who was aunt to Ahmose-Nefertari , was found in the outer coffin of Lady Rai .",

His reign is generally dated from 1526 to 1506 BC . He was a son of Ahmose I and Ahmose-Nefertari , but had at least two elder brothers , Ahmose-ankh and Ahmose Sapair , and was not expected to inherit the throne . However , sometime in the eight years between Ahmose I 's 17th regnal year and his death , his heir apparent died and Amenhotep became crown prince . He then acceded to the throne and ruled for about 21 years . Although his reign is poorly documented , it is possible to piece together a basic history from available evidence . He inherited the kingdom formed by his father 's military conquests and maintained dominance over Nubia and the Nile Delta but probably did not attempt to maintain Egyptian power in the Levant . He continued the rebuilding of temples in Upper Egypt and revolutionized mortuary complex design by separating his tomb from his mortuary temple , setting a trend in royal funerary monuments which would persist throughout the New Kingdom . After his death , he was deified as a patron god of Deir el-Medina .",

Thutmose I 's reign is generally dated to 1506-1493 BC , but a minority of scholars - who think that astrological observations used to calculate the timeline of ancient Egyptian records , and thus the reign of Thutmose I , were taken from the city of Memphis rather than from Thebes - would date his reign to 1526-1513 BC .

When Thutmose III died , he was buried in the Valley of the Kings , as were the rest of the kings from this period in Egypt ."
