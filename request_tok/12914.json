Instead , it has slight lemony overtones and creates a tingly numbness in the mouth due to hydroxy-\u03b1-sanshool . It is commonly used in Sichuanese dishes such as mapo doufu and Chongqing hot pot , and is often added together with chili peppers to create a flavor known in Mandarin as m\u00e1l\u00e0 ( \u9ebb\u8fa3 ; numb-spiciness ) .
