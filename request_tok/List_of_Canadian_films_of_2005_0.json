  "/wiki/AIDS": "Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( HIV/AIDS ) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Following initial infection a person may not notice any symptoms , or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness . Typically , this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms . If the infection progresses , it interferes more with the immune system , increasing the risk of developing common infections such as tuberculosis , as well as other opportunistic infections , and tumors which are otherwise rare in people who have normal immune function . These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . This stage is often also associated with unintended weight loss . HIV is spread primarily by unprotected sex ( including anal and oral sex ) , contaminated blood transfusions , hypodermic needles , and from mother to child during pregnancy , delivery , or breastfeeding . Some bodily fluids , such as saliva , sweat and tears , do not transmit the virus . HIV is a member of the group of viruses known as retroviruses . Methods of prevention include safe sex , needle exchange programs , treating those who are infected , pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis , and male circumcision . Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication . There is no cure or vaccine ; however , antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy .",

  "/wiki/Action_film": "Action film is a film genre in which the protagonist or protagonists are thrust into a series of events that typically include violence , extended fighting , physical feats , and frantic chases . Action films tend to feature a resourceful hero struggling against incredible odds , which include life-threatening situations , a villain , or a pursuit which usually concludes in victory for the hero ( though a small number of films in this genre have ended in the victory for the villain instead ) . Advancements in CGI have made it cheaper and easier to create action sequences and other visual effects that required the efforts of professional stunt crews in the past . However , reactions to action films containing significant amounts of CGI have been mixed , as films that use computer animations to create unrealistic , highly unbelievable events are often met with criticism . While action has long been a recurring component in films , the action film genre began to develop in the 1970s along with the increase of stunts and special effects . Common action scenes in films are generally , but not limited to , explosions , car chases , fistfights , and shootouts . This genre is closely associated with the thriller and adventure genres , and they may also contain elements of drama and spy fiction .",

Beowulf , a hero of the Geats , comes to the aid of Hrothgar , the king of the Danes , whose mead hall in Heorot has been under attack by a monster known as Grendel . After Beowulf slays him , Grendel 's mother attacks the hall and is then also defeated . Victorious , Beowulf goes home to Geatland ( G\u00f6taland in modern Sweden ) and becomes king of the Geats .

Iceland is volcanically and geologically active . The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields , mountains , and glaciers , and many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands . Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate , despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle . Its high latitude and marine influence keep summers chilly , with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate . According to the ancient manuscript Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k , the settlement of Iceland began in 874 AD when the Norwegian chieftain Ing\u00f3lfr Arnarson became the first permanent settler on the island . In the following centuries , Norwegians , and to a lesser extent other Scandinavians , emigrated to Iceland , bringing with them thralls ( i.e. , slaves or serfs ) of Gaelic origin . The island was governed as an independent commonwealth under the Althing , one of the world 's oldest functioning legislative assemblies . Following a period of civil strife , Iceland acceded to Norwegian rule in the 13th century . The establishment of the Kalmar Union in 1397 united the kingdoms of Norway , Denmark , and Sweden .",
