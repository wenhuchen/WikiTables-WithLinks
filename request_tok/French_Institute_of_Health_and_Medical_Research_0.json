In the mid-1970s , Alter and his research team demonstrated that most post-transfusion hepatitis cases were not due to hepatitis A and hepatitis B viruses . Working independently , Alter and Edward Tabor , a scientist at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , proved through transmission studies in chimpanzees that a new form of hepatitis , initially called non-A , non-B hepatitis caused the infections , and that the causative agent was probably a virus . This work eventually led to the discovery of the hepatitis C virus in 1988 . Alter has received recognition for the research leading to the discovery of the virus that causes hepatitis C. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal , the highest award conferred to civilians in United States government public health service , and the 2000 Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research .",
