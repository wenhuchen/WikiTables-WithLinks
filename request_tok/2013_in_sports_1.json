  "/wiki/Baseball": "Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding . The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team , called the pitcher , throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat . The objective of the offensive team ( batting team ) is to hit the ball into the field of play , allowing its players to run the bases , having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called runs . The objective of the defensive team ( fielding team ) is to prevent batters from becoming runners , and to prevent runners ' advance around the bases . A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate ( the place where the player started as a batter ) . The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner . The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely . A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called out can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner , either immediately or during teammates ' turns batting . The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners out , which forces them out of the field of play . Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team 's players out . The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding ; the batting team 's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs . One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning .",

  "/wiki/Tennis": "Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent ( singles ) or between two teams of two players each ( doubles ) . Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent 's court . The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return . The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point , while the opposite player will . Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages . The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket , including wheelchair users . The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham , England , in the late 19th century as lawn tennis . It had close connections both to various field ( lawn ) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis . During most of the 19th century , in fact , the term tennis referred to real tennis , not lawn tennis . The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s . Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times , and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s . A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system , which allows a player to contest the line call of a point , a system known as Hawk-Eye .",

  "/wiki/Cricket": "Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 20-metre ( 22-yard ) pitch with a wicket at each end , each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps . The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat , while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each player ( so they are out ) . Means of dismissal include being bowled , when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails , and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat , but before it hits the ground . When ten players have been dismissed , the innings ends and the teams swap roles . The game is adjudicated by two umpires , aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches . They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match 's statistical information . There are various formats ranging from Twenty20 , played over a few hours with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs , to Test matches , played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams each batting for two innings of unlimited length . Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit , but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours . In addition to the basic kit , some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball , which is a hard , solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core which is layered with tightly wound string . Historically , cricket 's origins are uncertain and the earliest definite reference is in south-east England in the middle of the 16th century .

A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three-point line , when it is worth three . After a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws . The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated . Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill . On offense , players may use a variety of shots - the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard . It is a violation to lift or drag one 's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling . The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) .

  "/wiki/American_football": "American football , referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron , [ nb 1 ] is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end . The offense , the team with possession of the oval-shaped football , attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it , while the defense , the team without possession of the ball , aims to stop the offense 's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves . The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays ; if they fail , they turn over the football to the defense , but if they succeed , they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive . Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins . American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of soccer and rugby . The first American football match was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the Father of American Football , established the snap , the line of scrimmage , eleven-player teams , and the concept of downs . Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game ( although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp 's ) . Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football . The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football .",

  "/wiki/Alpine_skiing": "Alpine skiing , or downhill skiing , is the pastime of sliding down snow-covered slopes on skis with fixed-heel bindings , unlike other types of skiing ( cross-country , Telemark , or ski jumping ) , which use skis with free-heel bindings . Whether for recreation or for sport , it is typically practised at ski resorts , which provide such services as ski lifts , artificial snow making , snow grooming , restaurants , and ski patrol . Off-piste skiers - those skiing outside ski area boundaries - may employ snowmobiles , helicopters or snowcats to deliver them to the top of a slope . Back-country skiers may use specialized equipment with a free-heel mode , including 'sticky ' skins on the bottoms of the skis to stop them sliding backwards during an ascent , then locking the heel and removing the skins for their descent . Alpine skiing has been an event at the Winter Olympic Games since 1936 .",

  "/wiki/Figure_skating": "Figure skating is a sport in which individuals , duos , or groups perform on figure skates on ice . It was the first winter sport to be included in the Olympic Games , when it was contested at the 1908 Olympics in London . The four Olympic disciplines are men 's singles , ladies ' singles , pair skating , and ice dance . Non-Olympic disciplines include synchronized skating , Theater on Ice , and four skating . From intermediate through senior-level competition , skaters generally perform two programs ( short and free skate ) , which may include spins , jumps , moves in the field , lifts , throw jumps , death spirals , and other elements or moves , depending on the discipline . The blade has a groove on the bottom creating two distinct edges : inside and outside . Judges prefer that skaters glide on one edge of the blade and not on both at the same time , which is referred to as a flat edge . During a spin , skaters use the sweet spot of the blade , formally called a rocker , which is the roundest portion of the blade , just behind the toe pick and near the middle of the blade . Skates used in singles and pair skating have a set of large , jagged teeth called toe picks on the front of the blade . Toe picks are mainly used for the take-off on jumps . Ice dance blades have smaller toe picks . Figure skaters compete at various levels from beginner up to the Olympic level ( senior ) at local , regional , sectional , national , and international competitions .",

  "/wiki/Curling": "Curling is a sport in which players slide stones on a sheet of ice toward a target area which is segmented into four concentric circles . It is related to bowls , boules and shuffleboard . Two teams , each with four players , take turns sliding heavy , polished granite stones , also called rocks , across the ice curling sheet toward the house , a circular target marked on the ice . Each team has eight stones , with each player throwing two . The purpose is to accumulate the highest score for a game ; points are scored for the stones resting closest to the centre of the house at the conclusion of each end , which is completed when both teams have thrown all of their stones . A game usually consists of eight or ten ends . The player can induce a curved path , described as curl , by causing the stone to slowly turn as it slides . The path of the rock may be further influenced by two sweepers with brooms or brushes , who accompany it as it slides down the sheet and sweep the ice in front of the stone . Sweeping a rock decreases the friction , which makes the stone travel a straighter path ( with less curl ) and a longer distance . A great deal of strategy and teamwork go into choosing the ideal path and placement of a stone for each situation , and the skills of the curlers determine the degree to which the stone will achieve the desired result . This gives curling its nickname of chess on ice .",

Louis Chevrolet and ousted General Motors founder William C. Durant started the company on November 3 , 1911 as the Chevrolet Motor Car Company . Durant used the Chevrolet Motor Car Company to acquire a controlling stake in General Motors with a reverse merger occurring on May 2 , 1918 and propelled himself back to the GM presidency . After Durant 's second ousting in 1919 , Alfred Sloan , with his maxim a car for every purse and purpose , would pick the Chevrolet brand to become the volume leader in the General Motors family , selling mainstream vehicles to compete with Henry Ford 's Model T in 1919 and overtaking Ford as the best-selling car in the United States by 1929 . Chevrolet-branded vehicles are sold in most automotive markets worldwide . In Oceania , Chevrolet is represented by Holden Special Vehicles , having returned to the region in 2018 after a 50-year absence with the launching of the Camaro and Silverado pickup truck ( HSV was partially and formerly owned by GM subsidiary Holden , which GM is retiring in 2020 ) . In 2005 , Chevrolet was relaunched in Europe , primarily selling vehicles built by GM Daewoo of South Korea with the tagline Daewoo has grown up enough to become Chevrolet , a move rooted in General Motors ' attempt to build a global brand around Chevrolet . With the reintroduction of Chevrolet to Europe , GM intended Chevrolet to be a mainstream value brand , while GM 's traditional European standard-bearers , Opel of Germany , and Vauxhall of United Kingdom would be moved upmarket . However , GM reversed this move in late 2013 , announcing that the brand would be withdrawn from Europe , with the exception of the Camaro and Corvette in 2016 . Chevrolet vehicles will continue to be marketed in the CIS states , including Russia . After General Motors fully acquired GM Daewoo in 2011 to create GM Korea , the last usage of the Daewoo automotive brand was discontinued in its native South Korea and succeeded by Chevrolet .
