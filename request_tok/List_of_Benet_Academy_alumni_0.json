  "/wiki/American_football": "American football , referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron , [ nb 1 ] is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end . The offense , the team with possession of the oval-shaped football , attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it , while the defense , the team without possession of the ball , aims to stop the offense 's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves . The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays ; if they fail , they turn over the football to the defense , but if they succeed , they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive . Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins . American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of soccer and rugby . The first American football match was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the Father of American Football , established the snap , the line of scrimmage , eleven-player teams , and the concept of downs . Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game ( although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp 's ) . Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football . The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football .",

The Saints began play in Tulane Stadium in 1967 where they remained until the 1974 NFL season , when they moved to the new Louisiana Superdome ( now the Mercedes-Benz Superdome ) .

The Oilers were a consistent playoff team from 1987 to 1993 , an era that included both of the Oilers ' only division titles ( 1991 and 1993 ) , as well as the dubious distinction of being on the losing end of the largest comeback in NFL history . For the rest of the Oilers ' time in Houston , however , they compiled losing seasons in almost every year outside the aforementioned high points . The Oilers ' main colors were Columbia blue and white , with scarlet trim , while their logo was a simple derrick . Oilers jerseys were always Columbia blue for home and white for away .",

  "/wiki/Rock_and_roll": "Rock and roll ( often written as rock & roll , rock ' n ' roll or rock ' n roll ) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s from musical styles such as gospel , jump blues , jazz , boogie woogie , rhythm and blues , and country music . While elements of what was to become rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s , the genre did not acquire its name until 1954 . According to Greg Kot , rock and roll refers to a style of popular music originating in the U.S. in the 1950s prior to its development by the mid-1960s into the more encompassing international style known as rock music , though the latter also continued to be known as rock and roll . For the purpose of differentiation , this article deals with the first definition . In the earliest rock and roll styles , either the piano or saxophone was typically the lead instrument , but these instruments were generally replaced or supplemented by guitar in the middle to late 1950s . The beat is essentially a dance rhythm with an accentuated backbeat , which is almost always provided by a snare drum . Classic rock and roll is usually played with one or two electric guitars ( one lead , one rhythm ) , a double bass or string bass or ( after the mid-1950s ) an electric bass guitar , and a drum kit . Beyond simply a musical style , rock and roll , as seen in movies , in fan magazines , and on television , influenced lifestyles , fashion , attitudes , and language . In addition , rock and roll may have contributed to the civil rights movement because both African-American and white American teenagers enjoyed the music . It went on to spawn various genres , often without the initially characteristic backbeat , that are now more commonly called rock music or simply rock .",

  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",

  "/wiki/Basketball": "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams , most commonly of five players each , opposing one another on a rectangular court , compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball ( approximately 9.4 inches ( 24 cm ) in diameter ) through the defender 's hoop ( a basket 18 inches ( 46 cm ) in diameter mounted 10 feet ( 3.048 m ) high to a backboard at each end of the court ) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop . A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three-point line , when it is worth three . After a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws . The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated . Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill . On offense , players may use a variety of shots - the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard . It is a violation to lift or drag one 's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling . The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) . Informally , players may play three-on-three , two-on-two , and one-on-one .
