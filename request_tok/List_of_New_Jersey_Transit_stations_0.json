Unlike all other stations on the Northeast Corridor Line , Jersey Avenue has low-level platforms ( the rest are elevated ) , and , since there is no wheelchair ramp , it is the only station on the line that is not handicapped-accessible . Jersey Avenue opened in October 1963 as part of an experimental park and ride program . Jersey Avenue has a different layout than most New Jersey Transit stations . While it has two platforms , one for trains heading south toward Trenton Transit Center and one for trains heading north toward New York Penn Station , the northbound platform is not positioned across the track from the southbound platform as would normally be the case for most New Jersey Transit stations ( especially those along the Northeast Corridor , which have a wider gap between platforms due to an extra track in each direction used by Amtrak ) . Instead , the northbound platform is set behind the southbound platform and the platforms are separated by a parking lot . With this layout , northbound trains from Trenton can not service Jersey Avenue and thus bypass the station en route to New York . Some southbound trains do terminate at Jersey Avenue , using a siding that is also used by special northbound trains that originate at the station . In April 2014 NJT approved a contract for a design for relocation and rebuilding the station platform to permit high-level boarding , along with pedestrian overpass , vertical circulation , improved parking , and bus connection areas , as well as improvements to 5 miles of the existing Delco freight line to make it a 130 kilometers per hour ( 80 miles per hour ) main line track for passenger trains .
