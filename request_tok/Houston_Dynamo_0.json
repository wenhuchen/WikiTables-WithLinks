  "/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)": "The goalkeeper , often shortened to keeper or goalie , is one of the major positions of association football . It is the most specialised position in the sport . The goalkeeper 's primary role is to prevent the opposing team from scoring ( moving the ball over the defended goal-line within the frame of the goal ) . This is accomplished by the goalkeeper moving into the path of the ball and either catching it or directing it away from the vicinity of the goal line . Within the penalty area goalkeepers are able to use their hands , making them ( outside throw-ins ) the only players on the field permitted to handle the ball . The special status of goalkeepers is indicated by them wearing different coloured kits from their teammates . The back-pass rule prevents goalkeepers handling direct passes back to them from teammates . Goalkeepers usually perform goal kicks , and also give commands to their defence during corner kicks , direct and indirect free kicks , and marking . Goalkeepers play an important role in directing on field strategy as they have an unrestricted view of the entire pitch , giving them a unique perspective on play development . The goalkeeper is the only required position of a team . If they are injured or sent off , a substitute goalkeeper has to take their place , otherwise an outfield player must take the ejected keeper 's place in goal . In order to replace a goalkeeper who is sent off , a team usually substitutes an outfield player for the backup keeper ( thus effectively the red card and substitution takes out two of the starting eleven players ) .",

MLS roster rules allow a team to sign players to contracts similar to Generation adidas contracts , which do not count against the MLS salary budget and may earn a much higher salary than the league minimum . MLS has since removed this wording from the roster rules . That means homegrown players will not count against the salary budget only if they are registered using supplemental roster slots , but will still count against the salary budget if they are registered using senior roster slots . There is , however , supplementary salary budget made by MLS only for homegrown players that are registered using senior roster slots called homegrown player funds . To place a player on its homegrown player list , making him eligible to sign as a homegrown player , players must have resided in that club 's home territory and participated in the club 's youth development system for at least one year , as well as meeting other unspecified league requirements . If a player on a team 's homegrown list goes to college or U17 , U20 , and U23 United States men 's national soccer teams , he remains eligible to sign as a homegrown player at any time as long as he is registered with the club as a homegrown player first .

  "/wiki/El_Salvador": "El Salvador ( /\u025bl \u02c8s\u00e6lv\u0259d\u0254\u02d0r/ ( listen ) ; Spanish : [ el sal\u03b2a\u02c8\u00f0o\u027e ] ( listen ) ) , officially the Republic of El Salvador ( Spanish : Rep\u00fablica de El Salvador , literally Republic of The Savior ) , is the smallest and the most densely populated country in Central America . It is bordered on the northeast by Honduras , on the northwest by Guatemala , and on the south by the Pacific Ocean . El Salvador 's capital and largest city is San Salvador . As of 2018 [ update ] , the country had a population of approximately 6.42 million . El Salvador was for centuries inhabited by several Mesoamerican nations , especially the Cuzcatlecs , as well as the Lenca and Maya . In the early 16th century , the Spanish Empire conquered the territory , incorporating it into the Viceroyalty of New Spain ruled from Mexico City . However the Viceroyalty of Mexico had little or no influence in the daily affairs of the Central American isthmus , which would be colonized in 1524 . In 1609 the area became the Captaincy General of Guatemala , from which El Salvador was part of until its independence from Spain , which took place in 1821 , as part of the First Mexican Empire , then further seceded , as part of the Federal Republic of Central America , in 1823 . When the Republic dissolved in 1841 , El Salvador became a sovereign nation , then formed a short-lived union with Honduras and Nicaragua called the Greater Republic of Central America , which lasted from 1895 to 1898 . From the late 19th to the mid-20th century , El Salvador endured chronic political and economic instability characterized by coups , revolts , and a succession of authoritarian rulers . Persistent socioeconomic inequality and civil unrest culminated in the devastating Salvadoran Civil War ( 1979-1992 ) , which was fought between the military-led government and a coalition of left-wing guerrilla groups . The conflict ended with the Chapultepec Peace Accords ."
