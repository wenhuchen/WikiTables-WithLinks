The route originates on the state 's western border at Columbus in Hickman County , and stretches across the southern portion of the state , terminating southeast of Elkhorn City on the Virginia state line . It is the longest Kentucky State Highway , though the official distance as listed in route logs is much less due to multiple concurrencies with U.S. Route 68 ( US 68 ) and U.S. Route 23 . The route was split into two segments from 2003 to November 2009 . Construction and relocation of Kentucky Route 80 in Graves , Calloway , and Marshall counties during this time caused the route to be split . A new , four-laned 8.5-mile ( 13.7 km ) section of Kentucky Route 80 opened in Calloway County on November 25 , 2009 . The route is now four-lanes from Mayfield to Aurora with plans to complete the four-laning from Aurora to Cadiz over the next few years . [ citation needed ]",
