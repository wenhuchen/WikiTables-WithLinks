  "/wiki/Plural_marriage": "Polygamy ( called plural marriage by Mormons in the 19th century or the Principle by modern fundamentalist practitioners of polygamy ) was practiced by leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) for more than half of the 19th century , and practiced publicly from 1852 to 1890 by between 20 and 30 percent of Latter-day Saint families . Note that there are various denominations that are considered Mormons and they have different beliefs and practices . [ citation needed ] The Latter-day Saints ' practice of polygamy has been controversial , both within Western society and the LDS Church itself . The U.S. was both fascinated and horrified by the practice of polygamy , with the Republican platform at one time referencing the twin relics of barbarism - polygamy and slavery . The private practice of polygamy was instituted in the 1830s by founder Joseph Smith . The public practice of plural marriage by the church was announced and defended in 1852 by a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles , Orson Pratt , by the request of church president Brigham Young . For over 60 years , the LDS Church and the United States were at odds over the issue : the church defended the practice as a matter of religious freedom , while the federal government aggressively sought to eradicate it , consistent with prevailing public opinion . Polygamy was probably a significant factor in the Utah War of 1857 and 1858 , given Republican attempts to paint Democratic President James Buchanan as weak in his opposition to both polygamy and slavery . In 1862 , the United States Congress passed the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act , which prohibited plural marriage in the territories . In spite of the law , Mormons continued to practice polygamy , believing that it was protected by the First Amendment . In 1879 , in Reynolds v. United States , the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the Morrill Act , stating : Laws are made for the government of actions , and while they can not interfere with mere religious belief and opinion , they may with practices . In 1890 , when it became clear that Utah would not be admitted to the Union while polygamy was still the practice , church president Wilford Woodruff issued a Manifesto that officially terminated the practice of polygamy .",
  "/wiki/Church_of_Jesus_Christ_Restored_(Ontario)": "The Church of Jesus Christ Restored is a small sect in the Latter Day Saint movement based at Chatsworth , Ontario , Canada . The church was founded in the late 1960s by Stanley M. King and is currently led by his son , Fred King . It reportedly has under 40 members , down from a high of around 80 . The group started as a fundamentalist offshoot of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ( RLDS Church , now known as Community of Christ ) . Like other fundamentalist Latter Day Saint churches , members practice polygamy and a form of the communal United Order . The church also runs a printing business called Resto Graphics , based in Mississauga , Ontario . After breaking from the RLDS Church , Stan King ( known as Prophet by his followers ) reinstated the old Mormon practice of plural marriage . Former church member Carol Christie claims King already had three church wives when she married him in the 1970s . One of his other wives was 14 years old at the time . Christie claims King later married three other children , ranging in age from ten to 17 . In the 1980s , the church moved from a farmhouse in Sauble Beach to its current headquarters , a bankrupt ski resort near Chatsworth , Ontario . King died of stroke in 1986 at the age of 58 .",
  "/wiki/United_Order": "In the Latter Day Saint movement , the United Order ( also called the United Order of Enoch ) was one of several 19th-century church collectivist programs . Early versions of the Order beginning in 1831 attempted to fully implement the law of consecration , a form of Christian communalism , modeled after the New Testament church which had all things in common . These early versions ended after a few years . Later versions within Mormonism , primarily in the Utah Territory , implemented less-ambitious cooperative programs , many of which were very successful . The Order 's full name invoked the city of Enoch , described in Latter Day Saint scripture as having such a virtuous and pure-hearted people that God had taken it to heaven . The United Order established egalitarian communities designed to achieve income equality , eliminate poverty , and increase group self-sufficiency . The movement had much in common with other communalist utopian societies formed in the United States and Europe during the Second Great Awakening which sought to govern aspects of people 's lives through precepts of faith and community organization . However , the Latter Day Saint United Order was more family- and property-oriented than the utopian experiments at Brook Farm and the Oneida Community . Membership in the United Order was voluntary , although during a period in the 1830s , it was a requirement of continued church membership . Participants would deed ( consecrate ) all their property to the United Order , which would in turn deed back an inheritance ( or stewardship ) which allowed members to control the property ; private property was not eradicated but was rather a fundamental principle of this system . At the end of each year , any excess that the family produced from their stewardship was voluntarily given back to the Order . The Order in each community was operated by the local bishop .",
  "/wiki/Restoration_Branches": "Restoration Branches movement is a Christian/Latter Day Saint religious sect which was formed in the 1980s by members of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ( RLDS , now the Community of Christ ) in a reaction against the events of the RLDS 1984 world conference . The movement holds in the traditional RLDS theology of the 19th and early-to-mid 20th centuries and hold that events leading up to and surrounding the 1980s and decades since have introduced sweeping , fundamental changes into RLDS doctrine and practice which are illegitimate because they contradict the long-standing RLDS theological tradition this sect holds as true . The movement is centered on Independence , Missouri which followers believe , as Joseph Smith , Jr and Joseph Smith III taught , is the centerplace of Zion . Traditionally , the branch is a local congregational unit in the RLDS church . The term Restoration was added as a result of the schism to denote a branch 's separation from the organizational hierarchy and inferring what participants see as loyalty to the original principles of the Restoration of Joseph Smith and the Reorganization of Joseph Smith III in stark contrast to the liberal theology embraced by the Community of Christ . Organizers of the Restoration Branches movement considered the official RLDS church organization to have become corrupt or to have fallen into apostasy , so that the church is now in a state of disorganization . Their primary disagreement with the Community of Christ , as the official RLDS church organization renamed itself in 2001 , was nominally over the church 's decision to ordain women to the priesthood . Restoration Branches continue to assert that only men have priesthood authority ; however , other religious and doctrinal issues were and are also disputed . No universally recognized central organization exists currently within the Restoration Branches movement , so any figures concerning membership numbers are difficult to ascertain . The Joint Conference of Restoration Branches was reported as having 6,000 to 7,000 registered members as of 2010 . However , all persons baptized by authoritative RLDS priesthood are regarded as church members by the conference regardless of formal registration , conference affiliation ( or lack thereof ) including non-affiliated branches , members of the Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and even some Community of Christ members ( depending on the circumstances of their baptism , given the movement 's stance against women in the priesthood ) and so what fraction of the total recognized membership are registered with the conference is unknown but it is considerably higher than the registered number .",

Smith 's paternal grandfather was Joseph Smith , Jr. , the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement , and his father was Joseph Smith III , the first president after the Church 's Reorganization . The first graduate of Graceland University , Fred M. earned a Ph.D. in psychology from Clark University in 1916 , setting him apart as one of the most highly educated members of his church at the time . Smith 's leadership was controversial . One biographer has called him a man of paradox and one of the most controversial figures in Reorganization history .
