Inspired by the country 's popular culture , she employed a na\u00efve folk art style to explore questions of identity , postcolonialism , gender , class , and race in Mexican society . Her paintings often had strong autobiographical elements and mixed realism with fantasy . In addition to belonging to the post-revolutionary Mexicayotl movement , which sought to define a Mexican identity , Kahlo has been described as a surrealist or magical realist . Born to a German father and a mestiza mother , Kahlo spent most of her childhood and adult life at La Casa Azul , her family home in Coyoac\u00e1n , now publicly accessible as the Frida Kahlo Museum . Although she was disabled by polio as a child , Kahlo had been a promising student headed for medical school until a traffic accident at age eighteen , which caused her lifelong pain and medical problems . During her recovery , she returned to her childhood hobby of art with the idea of becoming an artist . Kahlo 's interests in politics and art led to her joining the Mexican Communist Party in 1927 , through which she met fellow Mexican artist Diego Rivera . The couple married in 1928 , and spent the late 1920s and early 1930s travelling in Mexico and the United States together . During this time , she developed her artistic style , drew her main inspiration from Mexican folk culture , and painted mostly small self-portraits which mixed elements from pre-Columbian and Catholic beliefs . Her paintings raised the interest of Surrealist artist Andr\u00e9 Breton , who arranged for Kahlo 's first solo exhibition at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York in 1938 . The exhibition was a success and was followed by another in Paris in 1939 .",
