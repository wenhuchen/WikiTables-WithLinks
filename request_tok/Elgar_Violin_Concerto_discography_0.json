  "/wiki/Henry_J._Wood": "Sir Henry Joseph Wood CH ( 3 March 1869 - 19 August 1944 ) was an English conductor best known for his association with London 's annual series of promenade concerts , known as the Proms . He conducted them for nearly half a century , introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences . After his death , the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts , although they continued to be generally referred to as the Proms . Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent , Wood started his career as an organist . During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music , he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist . After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte 's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others , Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company . He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company . One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky 's Eugene Onegin in 1892 . From the mid-1890s until his death , Wood focused on concert conducting . He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen 's Hall , offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices . The series was successful , and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944 . By the 1920s , Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music .",

Founded in 1917 as an offshoot of the American Columbia Phonograph Company , it became an independent British-owned company in 1922 in a management buy-out after the parent company went into receivership . In 1925 it acquired a controlling interest in its American parent company to take advantage of a new electrical recording process . The British firm also controlled the US operations from 1925 until 1931 . That year Columbia Graphophone in the UK merged with the Gramophone Company ( which sold records under the HMV label ) to form EMI , At the same time Columbia divested itself of its American branch , which was eventually absorbed by Columbia Broadcasting System ( CBS ) in 1938 . As Columbia Records , it became a successful British label in the 1950s and 1960s , and was eventually replaced by the newly created EMI Records , as part of an EMI label consolidation .

  "/wiki/London_Symphony_Orchestra": "The London Symphony Orchestra ( LSO ) , founded in 1904 , is a British Orchestra and the oldest of London 's symphony orchestras . It was set up by a group of players who left Henry Wood 's Queen 's Hall Orchestra because of a new rule requiring players to give the orchestra their exclusive services . The LSO itself later introduced a similar rule for its members . From the outset the LSO was organised on co-operative lines , with all players sharing the profits at the end of each season . This practice continued for the orchestra 's first four decades . The LSO underwent periods of eclipse in the 1930s and 1950s when it was regarded as inferior in quality to new London orchestras , to which it lost players and bookings : the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the London Philharmonic in the 1930s and the Philharmonia and Royal Philharmonic after the Second World War . The profit-sharing principle was abandoned in the post-war era as a condition of receiving public subsidy for the first time . In the 1950s the orchestra debated whether to concentrate on film work at the expense of symphony concerts ; many senior players left when the majority of players rejected the idea . By the 1960s the LSO had recovered its leading position , which it has retained subsequently . In 1966 , to perform alongside it in choral works , the orchestra established the LSO Chorus , originally a mix of professional and amateur singers , later a wholly amateur ensemble . As a self-governing body , the orchestra selects the conductors with whom it works . At some stages in its history it has dispensed with a principal conductor and worked only with guests .",

  "/wiki/Malcolm_Sargent": "Sir Harold Malcolm Watts Sargent ( 29 April 1895 - 3 October 1967 ) was an English conductor , organist and composer widely regarded as Britain 's leading conductor of choral works . The musical ensembles with which he was associated included the Ballets Russes , the Huddersfield Choral Society , the Royal Choral Society , the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company , and the London Philharmonic , Hall\u00e9 , Liverpool Philharmonic , BBC Symphony and Royal Philharmonic orchestras . Sargent was held in high esteem by choirs and instrumental soloists , but because of his high standards and a statement that he made in a 1936 interview disputing musicians ' rights to tenure , his relationship with orchestral players was often uneasy . Despite this , he was co-founder of the London Philharmonic , was the first conductor of the Liverpool Philharmonic as a full-time ensemble , and played an important part in saving the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra from disbandment in the 1960s . As chief conductor of London 's internationally famous summer music festival the Proms from 1948 to 1967 , Sargent was one of the best-known English conductors . When he took over the Proms from their founder , Sir Henry Wood , he and two assistants conducted the two-month season between them . By the time he died , he was assisted by a large international roster of guest conductors . At the outbreak of the Second World War , Sargent turned down an offer of a major musical directorship in Australia and returned to the UK to bring music to as many people as possible as his contribution to national morale . His fame extended beyond the concert hall : to the British public , he was a familiar broadcaster in BBC radio talk shows , and generations of Gilbert and Sullivan devotees have known his recordings of the most popular Savoy Operas . He toured widely throughout the world and was noted for his skill as a conductor , his championship of British composers , and his debonair appearance , which won him the nickname Flash Harry .",

  "/wiki/London_Philharmonic_Orchestra": "The London Philharmonic Orchestra ( LPO ) is a British orchestra and one of five permanent symphony orchestras based in London [ clarification needed ] . It was founded by the conductors Sir Thomas Beecham and Malcolm Sargent in 1932 as a rival to the existing London Symphony Orchestra and BBC Symphony Orchestra . The founders ' ambition was to build an orchestra the equal of any European or American rival . Between 1932 and the Second World War the LPO was widely judged to have succeeded in this regard . After the outbreak of war , the orchestra 's private backers withdrew and the players reconstituted the LPO as a self-governing cooperative . In the post-war years , the orchestra faced challenges from two new rivals ; the Philharmonia and the Royal Philharmonic , founded respectively in 1946 and 1947 , achieved a quality of playing not matched by the older orchestras , including the LPO . By the 1960s the LPO had regained its earlier standards , and in 1964 it secured a valuable engagement to play in the Glyndebourne Festival opera house during the summer months . In 1993 it was appointed resident orchestra of the Royal Festival Hall on the south bank of the Thames , one of London 's major concert venues . Since 1995 the residency has been jointly held with the Philharmonia . In addition to its work at the Festival Hall and Glyndebourne , the LPO performs regularly at the Congress Theatre , Eastbourne and the Brighton Dome , and tours nationally and internationally . Since Beecham , the orchestra has had ten principal conductors , including Sir Adrian Boult , Bernard Haitink , Sir Georg Solti , Klaus Tennstedt and Vladimir Jurowski .

Brought up in a prosperous mercantile family , he followed musical studies in England and at Leipzig , Germany , with early conducting work in London for the Royal Opera House and Sergei Diaghilev 's ballet company . His first prominent post was conductor of the City of Birmingham Orchestra in 1924 . When the British Broadcasting Corporation appointed him director of music in 1930 , he established the BBC Symphony Orchestra and became its chief conductor . The orchestra set standards of excellence that were rivalled in Britain only by the London Philharmonic Orchestra ( LPO ) , founded two years later . Forced to leave the BBC in 1950 on reaching retirement age , Boult took on the chief conductorship of the LPO . The orchestra had declined from its peak of the 1930s , but under his guidance its fortunes were revived . He retired as its chief conductor in 1957 , and later accepted the post of president . Although in the latter part of his career he worked with other orchestras , including the London Symphony Orchestra , the Philharmonia Orchestra , the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra , and his former orchestra , the BBC Symphony , it was the LPO with which he was primarily associated , conducting it in concerts and recordings until 1978 , in what was widely called his Indian Summer . Boult was known for his championing of British music . He gave the first performance of his friend Gustav Holst 's The Planets , and introduced new works by , among others , Elgar , Bliss , Britten , Delius , Rootham , Tippett , Vaughan Williams and Walton .

  "/wiki/Philharmonia_Orchestra": "The Philharmonia Orchestra is a British orchestra based in London . It was founded in 1945 by Walter Legge , a classical music record producer for EMI . Among the conductors who worked with the orchestra in its early years were Richard Strauss , Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler and Arturo Toscanini ; of the Philharmonia 's younger conductors , the most important to its development was Herbert von Karajan , who though never formally chief conductor was closely associated with the orchestra in the late 1940s and early 1950s . The Philharmonia became widely regarded as the finest of London 's five symphony orchestras in its first two decades . From the late 1950s to the early 1970s the orchestra 's chief conductor was Otto Klemperer , with whom the orchestra gave many concerts and made numerous recordings of the core orchestral repertoire . During Klemperer 's tenure Legge , citing the difficulty of maintaining the orchestra 's high standards , attempted to disband it in 1964 , but the players , backed by Klemperer , formed themselves into a self-governing ensemble as the New Philharmonia Orchestra . After thirteen years under this title , they negotiated the rights to revert to the original name . In Klemperer 's last years the orchestra suffered a decline , both financial and artistic , but recovered under his successor , Riccardo Muti , who revitalised the orchestra in his ten-year term , 1972-1982 . The orchestra 's standards remained high throughout the controversial chief conductorship of Giuseppe Sinopoli from 1984 to 1994 , and the more orthodox tenure of Christoph von Dohn\u00e1nyi between 1997 and 2008 . Esa-Pekka Salonen , principal conductor since 2008 , is due to serve until 2021 , when Santtu-Matias Rouvali is scheduled to succeed him .

  "/wiki/BBC_Symphony_Orchestra": "The BBC Symphony Orchestra ( BBC SO ) is a British orchestra based in London . Founded in 1930 , it was the first permanent salaried orchestra in London , and is the only one of the city 's five major symphony orchestras not to be self-governing . The BBC SO is the principal broadcast orchestra of the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) . The orchestra was originally conceived in 1928 as a joint enterprise by the BBC and the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham , but the latter withdrew the next year ; and the task of assembling and training the orchestra fell to the BBC 's director of music , Adrian Boult . Among its guest conductors in its first years was Arturo Toscanini , who judged it the finest orchestra he had ever conducted . During and after the Second World War , Boult strove to maintain standards , but the senior management of the post-war BBC did not allocate the orchestra the resources to meet competition from new and well-funded rivals . After Boult 's retirement from the BBC in 1950 , the orchestra went through a fallow period . Boult 's successor , Sir Malcolm Sargent , was popular with the public but had poor rapport with his players , and orchestral morale dropped . Sargent 's successor , Rudolf Schwarz , made little public impact , and although the BBC appointed high-profile chief conductors in the 1960s and 1970s - Antal Dor\u00e1ti , Colin Davis , Pierre Boulez and Gennady Rozhdestvensky - the BBC SO remained underfunded and could not attract enough good players to rival the leading London orchestras . As a result of initiatives begun in the 1960s by the BBC controller of music William Glock , performing standards gradually began to rise . Under Andrew Davis in the 1990s and Ji\u0159\u00ed B\u011blohl\u00e1vek in the 2000s the orchestra prospered . By the second decade of the 21st century the BBC SO was once again regarded by critics as of first-class status .",

  "/wiki/Royal_Philharmonic_Orchestra": "The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra ( RPO ) , based in London , is a British Orchestra that was formed by Sir Thomas Beecham in 1946 . In its early days , the orchestra secured profitable recording contracts and important engagements including the Glyndebourne Festival Opera and the concerts of the Royal Philharmonic Society . After Beecham 's death in 1961 the orchestra 's fortunes declined steeply ; it battled for survival until the mid-1960s , when its future was secured after an Arts Council report recommended that it should receive public subsidy ; a further crisis arose in the same era when it seemed that the orchestra 's right to call itself Royal could be withdrawn . Since Beecham 's death , the RPO has had seven chief conductors , including Rudolf Kempe , Antal Dor\u00e1ti , Andr\u00e9 Previn and Vladimir Ashkenazy . Others closely associated with the orchestra have included Sir Charles Groves , Sir Charles Mackerras , Peter Maxwell Davies , Yehudi Menuhin and Leopold Stokowski . In 2004 , the orchestra acquired its first permanent London base , at the new Cadogan Hall in Chelsea . The RPO also gives concerts at the Royal Festival Hall , the Royal Albert Hall and venues around the UK and other countries . From its earliest days , the orchestra has been active in the recording studios , making film soundtracks and numerous gramophone recordings ; many of the LP recordings conducted by Beecham and others have been reissued on compact disc .",
