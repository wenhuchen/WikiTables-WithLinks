  "/wiki/Church_of_England": "The Church of England ( C of E ) is the established church of England . The Archbishop of Canterbury is the most senior cleric , although the monarch is the supreme governor . The Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion . It traces its history to the Christian church recorded as existing in the Roman province of Britain by the third century , and to the 6th-century Gregorian mission to Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury . The English church renounced papal authority when Henry VIII failed to secure an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon in 1534 . The English Reformation accelerated under Edward VI 's regents , before a brief restoration of papal authority under Queen Mary I and King Philip . The Act of Supremacy 1558 renewed the breach , and the Elizabethan Settlement charted a course enabling the English church to describe itself as both catholic and reformed :",
  "/wiki/Norman_architecture": "The term Norman architecture is used to categorise styles of Romanesque architecture developed by the Normans in the various lands under their dominion or influence in the 11th and 12th centuries . In particular the term is traditionally used for English Romanesque architecture . The Normans introduced large numbers of castles and fortifications including Norman keeps , and at the same time monasteries , abbeys , churches and cathedrals , in a style characterised by the usual Romanesque rounded arches ( particularly over windows and doorways ) and especially massive proportions compared to other regional variations of the style .",
  "/wiki/Nave": "The nave /ne\u026av/ is the central part of a church , stretching from the ( normally western ) main entrance or rear wall , to the transepts , or in a church without transepts , to the chancel . When a church contains side aisles , as in a basilica-type building , the strict definition of the term nave is restricted to the central aisle . In a broader , more colloquial sense , the nave includes all areas available for the lay worshippers , including the side-aisles and transepts . Either way , the nave is distinct from the area reserved for the choir and clergy .",
  "/wiki/Chancel": "In church architecture , the chancel is the space around the altar , including the choir and the sanctuary ( sometimes called the presbytery ) , at the liturgical east end of a traditional Christian church building . It may terminate in an apse . It is generally the area used by the clergy and choir during worship , while the congregation is in the nave . Direct access may be provided by a priest 's door , usually on the south side of the church . This is one definition , sometimes called the strict one ; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels , these are also often counted as part of the chancel , especially when discussing architecture . In smaller churches , where the altar is backed by the outside east wall and there is no distinct choir , the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area . In churches with a retroquire area behind the altar , this may only be included in the broader definition of chancel . In a cathedral or other large church , there may be a distinct choir area at the start of the chancel ( looking from the nave ) , before reaching the sanctuary , and an ambulatory may run beside and behind it . All these may be included in the chancel , at least in architectural terms ( see above ) . In many churches , the altar has now been moved to the front of the chancel , in what was built as the choir area , or to the centre of the transept , somewhat confusing the distinction between chancel , choir and sanctuary . In churches with less traditional plans , the term may not be useful in either architectural or ecclesiastical terms . The chancel may be a step or two higher than the level of the nave , and the sanctuary is often raised still further .",
  "/wiki/Buttress": "A buttress is an architectural structure built against or projecting from a wall which serves to support or reinforce the wall . Buttresses are fairly common on more ancient buildings , as a means of providing support to act against the lateral ( sideways ) forces arising out of the roof structures that lack adequate bracing . The term counterfort can be synonymous with buttress , and is often used when referring to dams , retaining walls and other structures holding back earth . Early examples of buttresses are found on the Eanna Temple ( ancient Uruk ) , dating to as early as the 4th millennium BCE . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/Victorian_restoration": "The Victorian restoration was the widespread and extensive refurbishment and rebuilding of Church of England churches and cathedrals that took place in England and Wales during the 19th-century reign of Queen Victoria . It was not the same process as is understood today by the term building restoration . Against a background of poorly maintained church buildings ; a reaction against the Puritan ethic manifested in the Gothic Revival ; and a shortage of churches where they were needed in cities , the Cambridge Camden Society and the Oxford Movement advocated a return to a more medieval attitude to churchgoing . The change was embraced by the Church of England which saw it as a means of reversing the decline in church attendance . The principle was to restore a church to how it might have looked during the Decorated style of architecture which existed between 1260 and 1360 , and many famous architects such as George Gilbert Scott and Ewan Christian enthusiastically accepted commissions for restorations . It is estimated that around 80% of all Church of England churches were affected in some way by the movement , varying from minor changes to complete demolition and rebuilding . Influential people like John Ruskin and William Morris were opposed to such large-scale restoration , and their activities eventually led to the formation of societies dedicated to building preservation , such as the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings . In retrospect , the period of Victorian restoration has been viewed in a generally unfavourable light .",

  "/wiki/English_Gothic_architecture": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls .",

  "/wiki/Lancet_window": "A lancet window is a tall , narrow window with a pointed arch at its top . It acquired the lancet name from its resemblance to a lance . Instances of this architectural motif are typical of Gothic church edifices of the earliest period . Lancet windows may occur singly , or paired under a single moulding , or grouped in an odd number with the tallest window at the centre . The architectural motif first appeared in the early French Gothic period ( c. 1140-1200 ) , and later in the English period of Gothic architecture ( 1200-1275 ) . So common was the lancet window feature that this era is sometimes known as the Lancet Period . The term lancet window is properly applied to windows of austere form , without tracery . Paired windows were sometimes surmounted by a simple opening such as a quatrefoil cut in plate tracery . This form gave way to the more ornate , multi-light traceried windowed .",

  "/wiki/Baptists": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the 18th and 19th centuries , the First and Second Great Awakening increased church membership in the United States . Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent .",

The church is headed by the Bishop of Rome , known as the pope . Its central administration is the Holy See . The Christian beliefs of Catholicism are found in the Nicene Creed . The Catholic Church teaches that it is the One , Holy , Catholic and Apostolic church founded by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission , [ note 1 ] that its bishops are the successors of Christ 's apostles , and that the pope is the successor to Saint Peter upon whom primacy was conferred by Jesus Christ .

  "/wiki/Methodism": "Methodism is an umbrella term used to describe denominations of Protestant Christianity which follow the line of the Methodist movement . Methodist denominations are historically related and derive their doctrine of practice and belief from the life and teachings of John Wesley . George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people .",
  "/wiki/Wesleyanism": "Wesleyan theology , otherwise known as Wesleyan-Arminian theology , or Methodist theology , is a theological tradition in Protestant Christianity that emphasizes the methods of the eighteenth-century evangelical reformers John Wesley and his brother Charles Wesley . More broadly , it refers to the theological system inferred from the various sermons , theological treatises , letters , journals , diaries , hymns , and other spiritual writings of the Wesleys and their contemporary coadjutors such as John William Fletcher . Wesleyan-Arminian theology , manifest today in Methodism ( inclusive of the Holiness movement ) , is named for its founders , the Wesleys , as well as for Jacob Arminius , since it is a subset of Arminian theology . In 1736 , these two brothers traveled to the Georgia colony in America as missionaries for the Church of England ; they left rather disheartened at what they saw . Both of them subsequently had religious experiences , especially John in 1738 , being greatly influenced by the Moravian Christians . They began to organize a renewal movement within the Church of England to focus on personal faith and holiness . John Wesley took Protestant churches to task over the nature of sanctification , the process by which a believer is conformed to the image of Christ , emphasizing New Testament teachings regarding the work of God and the believer in sanctification . The movement did well within the Church of England in Britain , but when the movement crossed the ocean into America , it took on a form of its own , finally being established as the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1784 . The Methodist churches are similar to Anglicanism ( in Church government and liturgical practices ) , yet have added a strong emphasis on personal faith and personal experience , especially on the new birth and entire sanctification . At its heart , the theology of John Wesley stressed the life of Christian holiness : to love God with all ones heart , mind , soul and strength , and to love one 's neighbour as oneself . Wesleys teaching also stressed experiential religion and moral responsibility .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

  "/wiki/Pentecostalism": "Pentecostalism or Classical Pentecostalism is a Protestant Christian movement that emphasises direct personal experience of God through baptism with the Holy Spirit . The term Pentecostal is derived from Pentecost , the Greek name for the Jewish Feast of Weeks . For Christians , this event commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the followers of Jesus Christ , as described in the second chapter of the Acts of the Apostles . Like other forms of evangelical Protestantism , Pentecostalism adheres to the inerrancy of the Bible and the necessity of accepting Jesus Christ as personal Lord and Savior . It is distinguished by belief in the baptism in the Holy Spirit that enables a Christian to live a Spirit-filled and empowered life . This empowerment includes the use of spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and divine healing - two other defining characteristics of Pentecostalism . Because of their commitment to biblical authority , spiritual gifts , and the miraculous , Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the Apostolic Age of the early church . For this reason , some Pentecostals also use the term Apostolic or Full Gospel to describe their movement . Pentecostalism emerged in the early 20th century among radical adherents of the Holiness movement who were energized by revivalism and expectation for the imminent Second Coming of Christ . Believing that they were living in the end times , they expected God to spiritually renew the Christian Church thereby bringing to pass the restoration of spiritual gifts and the evangelization of the world . In 1900 , Charles Parham , an American evangelist and faith healer , began teaching that speaking in tongues was the Bible evidence of Spirit baptism and along with William J. Seymour , a Wesleyan-Holiness preacher , he taught that this was the third work of grace . The three-year-long Azusa Street Revival , founded and led by Seymour in Los Angeles , California , resulted in the spread of Pentecostalism throughout the United States and the rest of the world as visitors carried the Pentecostal experience back to their home churches or felt called to the mission field .",

Evangelicals believe in the centrality of the conversion or born again experience in receiving salvation , in the authority of the Bible as God 's revelation to humanity , and in spreading the Christian message . The movement has long had a presence in the Anglosphere before spreading further afield in the 19th , 20th and early 21st centuries . Its origins are usually traced to 1738 , with various theological streams contributing to its foundation , including English Methodism , the Moravian Church ( in particular its bishop Nicolaus Zinzendorf and his community at Herrnhut ) , and German Lutheran Pietism . Preeminently , John Wesley and other early Methodists were at the root of sparking this new movement during the First Great Awakening . Today , evangelicals are found across many Protestant branches , as well as in various denominations not subsumed to a specific branch . Among leaders and major figures of the evangelical Protestant movement were John Wesley , George Whitefield , Jonathan Edwards , Billy Graham , Bill Bright , Harold Ockenga , John Stott and Martyn Lloyd-Jones . The movement gained great momentum during the 18th and 19th centuries with the Great Awakenings in Great Britain and the United States .

  "/wiki/Congregational_church": "Congregational churches ( also Congregationalist churches ; Congregationalism ) are Protestant churches in the Reformed tradition practicing congregationalist church governance , in which each congregation independently and autonomously runs its own affairs . Congregationalism , as defined by the Pew Research Center , is estimated to represent 0.5 percent of the worldwide Protestant population ; though their polity-related customs and other ideas influenced significant parts of Protestantism , as well as other Christian congregations . The report defines it very narrowly , encompassing mainly denominations in the United States and the United Kingdom , which can trace their history back to nonconforming Protestants , Puritans , Separatists , Independents , English religious groups coming out of the English Civil War , and other English dissenters not satisfied with the degree to which the Church of England had been reformed . Congregationalist tradition has a presence in the United States , the United Kingdom , Ireland , Canada , South Africa , Australia , New Zealand , and various island nations in the Pacific region . It has been introduced either by immigrant dissenter Protestants or by missionary organization such as the London Missionary Society . A number of evangelical Congregational churches are members of the World Evangelical Congregational Fellowship . In the United Kingdom , many Congregational churches claim their descent from Protestant denominations formed on a theory of union published by the theologian and English separatist Robert Browne in 1582 . Other accounts trace these origins further back to the London Underground Church of the 1560s . Ideas of nonconforming Protestants during the Puritan Reformation of the Church of England laid foundation for these churches . In England , the early Congregationalists were called Separatists or Independents to distinguish them from the similarly Calvinistic Presbyterians , whose churches embrace a polity based on the governance of elders . Congregationalists also differed with the Reformed churches using episcopalian church governance , which is usually led by a bishop . Congregationalism in the United States traces its origins to the Puritans of New England , who wrote the Cambridge Platform of 1648 to describe the autonomy of the church and its association with others .",

  "/wiki/Roughcast": "Roughcast or pebbledash is a coarse plaster surface used on outside walls that consists of lime and sometimes cement mixed with sand , small gravel , and often pebbles or shells . The materials are mixed into a slurry and are then thrown at the working surface with a trowel or scoop . The idea is to maintain an even spread , free from lumps , ridges or runs and without missing any background . Roughcasting incorporates the stones in the mix , whereas pebbledashing adds them on top . According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition ( 1910-1911 ) , roughcast used to be a widespread exterior coating given to the walls of common dwellings and outbuildings , but it is now frequently employed for decorative effect on country houses , especially those built using timber framing ( half timber ) . Variety can be obtained on the surface of the wall by small pebbles of different colours , and in the Tudor period fragments of glass were sometimes embedded . Though it is an occasional home-design fad , its general unpopularity in the UK today is estimated to reduce the value of a property by up to 5% . However roughcasting remains very popular in Scotland and rural Ireland , with a high percentage of new houses still being built with roughcasting . [ citation needed ] This exterior wall finish was made popular in England and Wales during the 1920s , when housing was in greater demand , and house builders were forced to cut costs wherever they could , and used pebbledash to cover poor quality brick work , which also added rudimentary weather protection . Pebbles were dredged from the seabed to provide the building materials needed , although most modern pebbledash is actually not pebbles at all , but small and sharp flint chips , and should correctly be called Spar dash or spa dash . There are several varieties of this spar dash such as Canterbury spar , sharp-dash , sharpstone dash , thrown dash , pebble stucco , Derbyshire Spar , Yellow spar , golden gravel , black and white , and also sunflower . According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition , the central tower of St Albans Cathedral , built with Roman tiles from Verulamium , was covered with roughcast believed to be as old as the building .",

  "/wiki/Timber_framing": "Timber framing and post-and-beam construction are traditional methods of building with heavy timbers , creating structures using squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs . It is commonplace in wooden buildings through the 19th century . If the structural frame of load-bearing timber is left exposed on the exterior of the building it may be referred to as half-timbered , and in many cases the infill between timbers will be used for decorative effect . The country most known for this kind of architecture is Germany . Timber framed houses are spread all over the country except in the southeast . The method comes from working directly from logs and trees rather than pre-cut dimensional lumber . Hewing this with broadaxes , adzes , and draw knives and using hand-powered braces and augers ( brace and bit ) and other woodworking tools , artisans or framers could gradually assemble a building . Since this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world , many styles of historic framing have developed . These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation , walls , how and where the beams intersect , the use of curved timbers , and the roof framing details .",

  "/wiki/Tracery": "In architecture , tracery is the stonework elements that support the glass in a Gothic window .

The evolving style from Romanesque to Gothic architecture and changing features , like the thinning of lateral walls and enlarging of windows lead to the innovation of tracery . The earliest form of tracery , called plate tracery , began as openings that were pierced from a stone slab . Bar tracery was then implemented , having derived from the plate tracery . However instead of a slab , the windows were defined by molded stone mullions which were lighter and allowed for more openings and intricate designs . Other notable styles of tracery to follow include geometrical tracery and curvilinear ( flowing ) tracery .",
