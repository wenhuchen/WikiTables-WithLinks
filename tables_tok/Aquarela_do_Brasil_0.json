[ 12 ] Also in 2009 , American band Beirut performed `` Brazil '' for their live DVD Beirut : Live At The Music Hall Of Williamsburg .

During the tournament 's opening ceremony , its first verses were performed live by Brazilian singer Claudia Leitte before being joined onstage by Pitbull and Jennifer Lopez to sing `` We Are One ( Ole Ola ) '' .",
