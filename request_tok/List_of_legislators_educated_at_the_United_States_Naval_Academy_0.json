The state 's largest city is Baltimore , and its capital is Annapolis . Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State , the Free State , and the Chesapeake Bay State . It is named after the English queen Henrietta Maria , known in England as Queen Mary , who was the wife of King Charles I. Sixteen of Maryland 's twenty-three counties , as well as the city of Baltimore , border the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay estuary and its many tributaries , which combined total more than 4,000 miles of shoreline . Although one of the smallest states in the U.S. , it features a variety of climates and topographical features that have earned it the moniker of America in Miniature . In a similar vein , Maryland 's geography , culture , and history combine elements of the Mid-Atlantic , Northeastern , and South Atlantic regions of the country . Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century , Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans , mostly by the Algonquin , and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux . As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain , Maryland was founded by George Calvert , a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England . In 1632 , Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter , naming the colony after his wife , Queen Mary ( Henrietta Maria of France ) . Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans , who rejected Catholicism in their settlements , Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration . Accordingly , in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion , which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation . Nevertheless , religious strife was common in the early years , and Catholics remained a minority , albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony .",

The war led to emergence of U.S. predominance in the Caribbean region , and resulted in U.S. acquisition of Spain 's Pacific possessions . That led to U.S. involvement in the Philippine Revolution and ultimately in the Philippine-American War . The main issue was Cuban independence . Revolts had been occurring for some years in Cuba against Spanish rule . The U.S. later backed these revolts upon entering the Spanish-American War . There had been war scares before , as in the Virginius Affair in 1873 , but in the late 1890s , American public opinion was agitated by reports of gruesome Spanish atrocities . The business community had just recovered from a deep depression and feared that a war would reverse the gains . It lobbied vigorously against going to war .

  "/wiki/World_War_I": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",

A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states .

Before World War II , the fleet patrolled the Philippine Islands . Much of the fleet was destroyed by the Japanese by February 1942 , after which it was dissolved and incorporated into the naval component of the South West Pacific Area command , which eventually became the Seventh Fleet . The fleet was created when its predecessor , the Asiatic Squadron , was upgraded to fleet status in 1902 . In early 1907 , the fleet was downgraded and became the First Squadron of the United States Pacific Fleet . However , on 28 January 1910 , the ships of that squadron were again organized as the Asiatic Fleet . Thus constituted , the Asiatic Fleet , based in the Philippines , was organizationally independent of the Pacific Fleet , which was based on the United States West Coast until it moved to Pearl Harbor in the Territory of Hawaii in 1940 . Although much smaller than any other U.S. Navy fleet and indeed far smaller than what any navy generally considers to be a fleet , the Asiatic Fleet from 1916 was commanded by one of only four four-star admirals authorized in the U.S. Navy at the time . This reflected the prestige of the position of Asiatic Fleet commander-in-chief , who generally was more powerful and influential with regard to the affairs of the United States in China than was the American minister , or later United States Ambassador , to China .",

Because the medal is presented in the name of Congress , it is often referred erroneously as the Congressional Medal of Honor . However , the official name of the current award is Medal of Honor . Within the United States Code the medal is referred to as the Medal of Honor , and less frequently as Congressional Medal of Honor . U.S. awards , including the Medal of Honor , do not have post-nominal titles , and while there is no official abbreviation , the most common abbreviations are MOH and MH . There are three versions of the medal , one each for the Army , Navy and Air Force . Personnel of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard receive the Navy version while members of the Space Force receive the Air Force version . The Medal of Honor was introduced for the Navy in 1861 , soon followed by an Army version in 1862 . The Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States ' armed forces . The President typically presents the Medal at a formal ceremony intended to represent the gratitude of the U.S. people , with posthumous presentations made to the primary next of kin . According to the Medal of Honor Historical Society of the United States , there have been 3,525 Medals of Honor awarded to 3,506 individuals since the decoration 's creation , with over 40% awarded for actions during the American Civil War .",

The Vi\u1ec7t Minh captured and controlled most of the rural areas in Vietnam which led to French defeat in 1954 . The negotiations in the Geneva Conference that year ended the war and recognized Vietnamese independence . The Geneva Accords provisionally divided the country into a northern and a southern zone along the 17th parallel , stipulating general elections in July 1956 to bring about the unification of Viet-Nam . The northern zone was controlled by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and became commonly called North Vietnam , while the southern zone , under control of the French-established State of Vietnam was commonly called South Vietnam .

In the early 17th century , the Dutch and the Swedes founded the first European settlements in the state . The English later seized control of the region , naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest of the Channel Islands , Jersey , and granting it as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley , 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton . New Jersey was the site of several important battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century .

Unlike the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , which is a domestic security service , the CIA has no law enforcement function and is mainly focused on overseas intelligence gathering , with only limited domestic intelligence collection . Though it is not the only agency of the federal government of the United States specializing in HUMINT , the CIA serves as the national manager for coordination of HUMINT activities across the U.S. intelligence community . Moreover , the CIA is the only agency authorized by law to carry out and oversee covert action at the behest of the President . It exerts foreign political influence through its tactical divisions , such as the Special Activities Center . The CIA was also instrumental in establishing intelligence services in several U.S. allied countries , such as Germany 's BND . Before the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 , the CIA Director concurrently served as the head of the Intelligence Community ; today , the CIA is organized under the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) . Despite transferring some of its powers to the DNI , the CIA has grown in size as a result of the September 11 attacks . In 2013 , The Washington Post reported that in the fiscal year 2010 , the CIA had the largest budget of all IC agencies , exceeding previous estimates .

The mujahideen groups were backed primarily by the United States , Saudi Arabia , and Pakistan , making it a Cold War proxy war . Between 562,000 and 2,000,000 civilians were killed and millions of Afghans fled the country as refugees , mostly to Pakistan and Iran . The war derives from a 1978 coup when Afghanistan 's communist party took power , initiating a series of radical modernization reforms throughout the country . These reforms were deeply unpopular among the more traditional rural population and established power structures . [ page needed ] The repressive nature of Soviet Afghanistan , which vigorously suppressed opposition including the execution of thousands of political prisoners , led to the rise of anti-government armed groups and by April 1979 large parts of the country were in open rebellion . The ruling party itself experienced deep rivalries , and in September 1979 the President , Nur Mohammad Taraki , was murdered under orders of the second-in-command , Hafizullah Amin , which soured relations with the Soviet Union . Eventually the Soviet government , under leader Leonid Brezhnev , decided to deploy the 40th Army on December 24 , 1979 . Arriving in the capital Kabul , they staged a coup , killing president Amin and installing Soviet loyalist Babrak Karmal from a rival faction . The deployment had been variously called an invasion ( by Western media and the rebels ) or a legitimate supporting intervention ( by the Soviet Union and the Afghan government ) on the basis of the Brezhnev Doctrine .

The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay , which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna . The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond ; Virginia Beach is the most populous city , and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision . The Commonwealth 's estimated population as of 2018 [ update ] is over 8.5 million . The area 's history begins with several indigenous groups , including the Powhatan . In 1607 the London Company established the Colony of Virginia as the first permanent English colony in the New World . Virginia 's state nickname , the Old Dominion , is a reference to this status . Slave labor and the land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each played a significant role in the colony 's early politics and plantation economy . Virginia was one of the 13 Colonies in the American Revolution . In the American Civil War , Virginia 's Secession Convention resolved to join the Confederacy , and Virginia 's First Wheeling Convention resolved to remain in the Union ; that led to the creation of West Virginia . Although the Commonwealth was under one-party rule for nearly a century following Reconstruction , both major national parties are competitive in modern Virginia . The Virginia General Assembly is the oldest continuous law-making body in the New World .",
