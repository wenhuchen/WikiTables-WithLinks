In spoken French , this arrondissement is referred to as septi\u00e8me . The arrondissement , called Palais-Bourbon , includes some of the major and well-known tourist attractions of Paris , such as the Eiffel Tower , the H\u00f4tel des Invalides ( Napoleon 's resting place ) , the Chapel of Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal , and a concentration of such world-famous museums as the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay , Mus\u00e9e Rodin , and the Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly . Situated on the Rive Gauche - the Left bank of the River Seine - this central arrondissement , which includes the historical aristocratic neighbourhood of Faubourg Saint-Germain , contains a number of French national institutions , among them the French National Assembly and numerous government ministries . It is also home to many foreign diplomatic embassies , some of them occupying outstanding H\u00f4tels particuliers . The arrondissement has been home to the French upper class since the 17th century , when it became the new residence of French highest nobility . The district has been so fashionable within the French aristocracy that the phrase le Faubourg - referring to the ancient name of the current 7th arrondissement - has been used to describe French nobility ever since . The 7th arrondissement of Paris and Neuilly-sur-Seine form the most affluent and prestigious residential area in France .",

These additional events include the other two equestrian events . It is not certain how many competitors there were , but it is likely that there were between 37 and 64 . Calculation of number of competitors is complicated by the fact that a rider might enter an event multiple times on different horses . Five nations competed in the Olympic jumping events , with three more ( Germany , Spain , and Austria ) in the other two competitions . There were two female riders : Elvira Guerra , who competed in the hacks and hunter combined event , as well as a Frenchwoman Moulin , whose first name is not known .",
