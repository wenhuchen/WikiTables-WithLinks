  "section_title": "Awards -- ACE Coasters Classics",
  "section_text": "The ACE Coaster Classic award was developed during a period when changes in the design , equipping , and operation of wood coasters threatened to erase these time-honored experiences and rituals . The award is designed to recognize coasters that still adhere to these principles while allowing riders to safely experience the thrill of the classic wooden roller coaster ride . To be eligible for ACE Coaster Classic status , the coaster must meet the following criteria : [ 10 ] Traditional lap bars that allow riders to experience so-called airtime , or negative G 's , the sensation of floating above the seat , must be installed . Individual , ratcheting lap bars do not meet this requirement . Riders must be able to slide from side-to-side in their seats . A coaster with any restraint or device that restricts this freedom , like seat dividers between riders , does not meet this requirement . Riders must be able to view upcoming drops and thrills . A coaster with headrests on every seat or the majority of seats that restrict this view does not meet this requirement . Riders must be free to choose where they sit . A coaster where riders are assigned seats before boarding does not meet this requirement . The amusement park or theme park operating a coaster that is recognized as a Coaster Classic is usually presented a custom plaque . The plaque typically states : \u201c THE AMERICAN COASTER ENTHUSIASTS RECOGNIZES THIS COASTER AS AN ACE COASTER CLASSIC . ACE salutes this park for maintaining this coaster as an American treasure in its purest form . We congratulate you for the use of traditional materials , methods and equipment , which are fundamental to the classic wooden roller coaster experience . ACE commends this park for operating this coaster in the traditional manner so that future generations may enjoy its classic thrills and its enduring popularity . \u201d",
  "uid": "American_Coaster_Enthusiasts_0",
  "intro": "American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE) is a non-profit organization focusing on the enjoyment, knowledge, and preservation of roller coasters as well as recognition of some as architectural and engineering landmarks. Dues paying members receive the quarterly magazine RollerCoaster! and bi-monthly newsletter ACE News. Amusement parks have also invited members to exclusive ride events at amusement parks as well as sneak peek events at new roller coasters under construction. The organization maintains an online database of roller coasters including ride specifications and archives of published news articles. The club also recognizes historically significant roller coasters with Coaster Classic and ACE Roller Coaster Landmark statuses."
