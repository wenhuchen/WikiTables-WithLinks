For a given number of unknowns , the number of solutions to a system of linear equations depends only on the rank of the matrix representing the system and the rank of the corresponding augmented matrix . Specifically , according to the Rouch\u00e9-Capelli theorem , any system of linear equations is inconsistent ( has no solutions ) if the rank of the augmented matrix is greater than the rank of the coefficient matrix ; if , on the other hand , the ranks of these two matrices are equal , the system must have at least one solution . The solution is unique if and only if the rank equals the number of variables . Otherwise the general solution has k free parameters where k is the difference between the number of variables and the rank ; hence in such a case there are an infinitude of solutions .

  "/wiki/Control_theory": "Control theory in control systems engineering is a subfield of mathematics that deals with the control of continuously operating dynamical systems in engineered processes and machines . The objective is to develop a control model for controlling such systems using a control action in an optimum manner without delay or overshoot and ensuring control stability . To do this , a controller with the requisite corrective behaviour is required . This controller monitors the controlled process variable ( PV ) , and compares it with the reference or set point ( SP ) . The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable , called the error signal , or SP-PV error , is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point . Other aspects which are also studied are controllability and observability . This is the basis for the advanced type of automation that revolutionized manufacturing , aircraft , communications and other industries . This is feedback control , which is usually continuous and involves taking measurements using a sensor and making calculated adjustments to keep the measured variable within a set range by means of a final control element , such as a control valve . Extensive use is usually made of a diagrammatic style known as the block diagram . In it the transfer function , also known as the system function or network function , is a mathematical model of the relation between the input and output based on the differential equations describing the system . Control theory dates from the 19th century , when the theoretical basis for the operation of governors was first described by James Clerk Maxwell . Control theory was further advanced by Edward Routh in 1874 , Charles Sturm and in 1895 , Adolf Hurwitz , who all contributed to the establishment of control stability criteria ; and from 1922 onwards , the development of PID control theory by Nicolas Minorsky .",

  "/wiki/Associative_algebra": "In mathematics , an associative algebra is an algebraic structure with compatible operations of addition , multiplication ( assumed to be associative ) , and a scalar multiplication by elements in some field . The addition and multiplication operations together give A the structure of a ring ; the addition and scalar multiplication operations together give A the structure of a vector space over K. In this article we will also use the term K-algebra to mean an associative algebra over the field K. A standard first example of a K-algebra is a ring of square matrices over a field K , with the usual matrix multiplication . In this article associative algebras are assumed to have a multiplicative identity , denoted 1 ; they are sometimes called unital associative algebras for clarification . In some areas of mathematics this assumption is not made , and we will call such structures non-unital associative algebras . We will also assume that all rings are unital , and all ring homomorphisms are unital . Many authors consider the more general concept of an associative algebra over a commutative ring R , instead of a field : An R-algebra is an R-module with an associative R-bilinear binary operation , which also contains a multiplicative identity .

The interval at which the DTFT is sampled is the reciprocal of the duration of the input sequence . An inverse DFT is a Fourier series , using the DTFT samples as coefficients of complex sinusoids at the corresponding DTFT frequencies . It has the same sample-values as the original input sequence . The DFT is therefore said to be a frequency domain representation of the original input sequence . If the original sequence spans all the non-zero values of a function , its DTFT is continuous ( and periodic ) , and the DFT provides discrete samples of one cycle . If the original sequence is one cycle of a periodic function , the DFT provides all the non-zero values of one DTFT cycle . The DFT is the most important discrete transform , used to perform Fourier analysis in many practical applications . In digital signal processing , the function is any quantity or signal that varies over time , such as the pressure of a sound wave , a radio signal , or daily temperature readings , sampled over a finite time interval ( often defined by a window function ) . In image processing , the samples can be the values of pixels along a row or column of a raster image . The DFT is also used to efficiently solve partial differential equations , and to perform other operations such as convolutions or multiplying large integers . Since it deals with a finite amount of data , it can be implemented in computers by numerical algorithms or even dedicated hardware .",

  "/wiki/Euclidean_space": "Euclidean space is the fundamental space of classical geometry . Originally it was the three-dimensional space of Euclidean geometry , but in modern mathematics there are Euclidean spaces of any nonnegative integer dimension , including the three-dimensional space and the Euclidean plane ( dimension two ) . It was introduced by the Ancient Greek mathematician Euclid of Alexandria , and the qualifier Euclidean is used to distinguish it from other spaces that were later discovered in physics and modern mathematics . Ancient Greek geometers introduced Euclidean space for modeling the physical universe . Their great innovation was to prove all properties of the space as theorems by starting from a few fundamental properties , called postulates , which either were considered as evident ( for example , there is exactly one straight line passing through two points ) , or seemed impossible to prove ( parallel postulate ) . After the introduction at the end of 19th century of non-Euclidean geometries , the old postulates were re-formalized to define Euclidean spaces through axiomatic theory . Another definition of Euclidean spaces by mean of vector spaces and linear algebra has been shown to be equivalent to the axiomatic definition . It is this definition that is more commonly used in modern mathematics , and detailed in this article . In all definitions , Euclidean spaces consist of points , which are defined only by the properties that they must have for forming a Euclidean space . There is essentially only one Euclidean space of each dimension ; that is , all Euclidean spaces of a given dimension are isomorphic . Therefore , in many cases , it is possible to work with a specific Euclidean space , which is generally the real n-space R n , { \\displaystyle \\mathbb { R } ^ { n } , } equipped with the dot product .

The first usage of the concept of a vector space with an inner product is due to Giuseppe Peano , in 1898 . An inner product naturally induces an associated norm , ( x and y are the norm in the picture ) thus an inner product space is also a normed vector space . A complete space with an inner product is called a Hilbert space .

Informally , a blob is a region of an image in which some properties are constant or approximately constant ; all the points in a blob can be considered in some sense to be similar to each other . The most common method for blob detection is convolution . Given some property of interest expressed as a function of position on the image , there are two main classes of blob detectors : ( i ) differential methods , which are based on derivatives of the function with respect to position , and ( ii ) methods based on local extrema , which are based on finding the local maxima and minima of the function . With the more recent terminology used in the field , these detectors can also be referred to as interest point operators , or alternatively interest region operators ( see also interest point detection and corner detection ) . There are several motivations for studying and developing blob detectors . One main reason is to provide complementary information about regions , which is not obtained from edge detectors or corner detectors . In early work in the area , blob detection was used to obtain regions of interest for further processing . These regions could signal the presence of objects or parts of objects in the image domain with application to object recognition and/or object tracking . In other domains , such as histogram analysis , blob descriptors can also be used for peak detection with application to segmentation .
