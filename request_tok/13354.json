  "/wiki/Acropolis_of_Athens": "The Acropolis of Athens is an ancient citadel located on a rocky outcrop above the city of Athens and contains the remains of several ancient buildings of great architectural and historic significance , the most famous being the Parthenon . The word acropolis is from the Greek words \u1f04\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd ( akron , highest point , extremity ) and \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 ( polis , city ) . Although the term acropolis is generic and there are many other acropoleis in Greece , the significance of the Acropolis of Athens is such that it is commonly known as The Acropolis without qualification . During ancient times it was known also more properly as Cecropia , after the legendary serpent-man , Cecrops , the supposed first Athenian king . While there is evidence that the hill was inhabited as far back as the fourth millennium BC , it was Pericles ( c. 495-429 BC ) in the fifth century BC who coordinated the construction of the site 's most important present remains including the Parthenon , the Propylaia , the Erechtheion and the Temple of Athena Nike . The Parthenon and the other buildings were seriously damaged during the 1687 siege by the Venetians during the Morean War when gunpowder being stored in the Parthenon was hit by a cannonball and exploded .",

Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world 's oldest cities , with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years and its earliest human presence started somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennium BC . Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus . A center for the arts , learning and philosophy , home of Plato 's Academy and Aristotle 's Lyceum , it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy , largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent , and in particular the Romans . In modern times , Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic , financial , industrial , maritime , political and cultural life in Greece . Athens is a global city and one of the biggest economic centers in southeastern Europe . It has a large financial sector , and its port Piraeus is both the largest passenger port in Europe , and the second largest in the world . The Municipality of Athens ( also City of Athens ) , which actually constitutes a small administrative unit of the entire city , had a population of 664,046 ( in 2011 ) within its official limits , and a land area of 38.96 km2 ( 15.04 sq mi ) . The urban area of Athens ( Greater Athens and Greater Piraeus ) extends beyond its administrative municipal city limits , with a population of 3,090,508 ( in 2011 ) over an area of 412 km2 ( 159 sq mi ) . According to Eurostat in 2011 , the functional urban area ( FUA ) of Athens was the 9th most populous FUA in the European Union ( the 6th most populous capital city of the EU ) , with a population of 3.8 million people .

It is a peninsula projecting into the Aegean Sea , bordering on Boeotia to the north and Megaris to the west . The southern tip of the peninsula , known as Laurion , was an important mining region . The history of Attica is tightly linked with that of Athens , and specifically the Golden Age of Athens during the classical period . Ancient Attica ( Athens city-state ) was divided into demoi or municipalities from the reform of Cleisthenes in 508/7 BC , grouped into three zones : urban ( astu ) in the region of Athens main city and Piraeus ( port of Athens ) , coastal ( paralia ) along the coastline and inland ( mesogeia ) in the interior .

The kingdom was founded and initially ruled by the royal Argead dynasty , which was followed by the Antipatrid and Antigonid dynasties . Home to the ancient Macedonians , the earliest kingdom was centered on the northeastern part of the Greek peninsula , and bordered by Epirus to the west , Paeonia to the north , Thrace to the east and Thessaly to the south . Before the 4th century BC , Macedonia was a small kingdom outside of the area dominated by the great city-states of Athens , Sparta and Thebes , and briefly subordinate to Achaemenid Persia . During the reign of the Argead king Philip II ( 359-336 BC ) , Macedonia subdued mainland Greece and the Thracian Odrysian kingdom through conquest and diplomacy . With a reformed army containing phalanxes wielding the sarissa pike , Philip II defeated the old powers of Athens and Thebes in the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC . Philip II 's son Alexander the Great , leading a federation of Greek states , accomplished his father 's objective of commanding the whole of Greece when he destroyed Thebes after the city revolted . During Alexander 's subsequent campaign of conquest , he overthrew the Achaemenid Empire and conquered territory that stretched as far as the Indus River . For a brief period , his empire was the most powerful in the world - the definitive Hellenistic state , inaugurating the transition to a new period of Ancient Greek civilization . Greek arts and literature flourished in the new conquered lands and advances in philosophy , engineering , and science spread throughout much of the ancient world . Of particular importance were the contributions of Aristotle , tutor to Alexander , whose writings became a keystone of Western philosophy . After Alexander 's death in 323 BC , the ensuing wars of the Diadochi , and the partitioning of Alexander 's short-lived empire , Macedonia remained a Greek cultural and political center in the Mediterranean region along with Ptolemaic Egypt , the Seleucid Empire , and the Kingdom of Pergamon .",

He was a member of the Argead dynasty of Macedonian kings , the third son of King Amyntas III of Macedon , and father of Alexander the Great and Philip III . The rise of Macedon , its conquest and political consolidation of most of Classical Greece during the reign of Philip II was achieved in part by his reformation of the Ancient Macedonian army , establishing the Macedonian phalanx that proved critical in securing victories on the battlefield . After defeating the Greek city-states of Athens and Thebes at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC , Philip II led the effort to establish a federation of Greek states known as the League of Corinth , with him as the elected hegemon and commander-in-chief of Greece for a planned invasion of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia .

The name Pythia is derived from Pytho , which in myth was the original name of Delphi . In etymology , the Greeks derived this place name from the verb , \u03c0\u03cd\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ( p\u00fathein ) to rot , which refers to the sickly sweet smell of the decomposition of the body of the monstrous Python after she was slain by Apollo . The Pythia was established at the latest in the 8th century BC , and was widely credited for her prophecies inspired by being filled by the spirit of the god ( or enthusiasmos ) , in this case Apollo . The Pythian priestess emerged pre-eminent by the end of 7th century BC and would continue to be consulted until the 4th century AD . During this period the Delphic Oracle was the most prestigious and authoritative oracle among the Greeks , and she was without a doubt the most powerful woman of the classical world . The oracle is one of the best-documented religious institutions of the classical Greeks . Authors who mention the oracle include Aeschylus , Aristotle , Clement of Alexandria , Diodorus , Diogenes , Euripides , Herodotus , Julian , Justin , Livy , Lucan , Nepos , Ovid , Pausanias , Pindar , Plato , Plutarch , Sophocles , Strabo , Thucydides and Xenophon . Nevertheless , details of how the Pythia operated are missing as authors from the classical period ( 6th to 4th centuries BC ) treat the process as common knowledge with no need to explain . Those who discussed the oracle in any detail are from 1st century BC to 4th century AD and give conflicting stories . One of the main stories claimed that the Pythia delivered oracles in a frenzied state induced by vapours rising from a chasm in the rock , and that she spoke gibberish which priests interpreted as the enigmatic prophecies and turned them into poetic dactylic hexameters preserved in Greek literature . This idea , however , has been challenged by scholars such as Joseph Fontenrose and Lisa Maurizio , who argue that the ancient sources uniformly represent the Pythia speaking intelligibly , and giving prophecies in her own voice .",

Delphic Apollo is the patron of seafarers , foreigners and the protector of fugitives and refugees .

Several signal events from the 4th to 6th centuries mark the period of transition during which the Roman Empire 's Greek East and Latin West diverged . Constantine I ( r. 324-337 ) reorganised the empire , made Constantinople the new capital and legalised Christianity . Under Theodosius I ( r. 379-395 ) , Christianity became the state religion and other religious practices were proscribed . In the reign of Heraclius ( r. 610-641 ) , the Empire 's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use in place of Latin . Although the Roman state continued and its traditions were maintained , modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome insofar as it was centred on Constantinople , oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture and characterised by Eastern Orthodox Christianity . The borders of the empire fluctuated through cycles of decline and recovery .

Although initially the dynasty was of Turkic origin , it was Persianised in terms of language , culture , literature and habits . After 1354 , the Ottomans crossed into Europe , and with the conquest of the Balkans , the Ottoman beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire . The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror . During the 16th and 17th centuries , at the height of its power under the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent , the Ottoman Empire was a multinational , multilingual empire controlling most of Southeast Europe , parts of Central Europe , Western Asia , parts of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus , North Africa and the Horn of Africa . At the beginning of the 17th century , the empire contained 32 provinces and numerous vassal states . Some of these were later absorbed into the Ottoman Empire , while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries . [ note 7 ] With Constantinople as its capital and control of lands around the Mediterranean Basin , the Ottoman Empire was at the centre of interactions between the Eastern and Western worlds for six centuries . While the empire was once thought to have entered a period of decline following the death of Suleiman the Magnificent , this view is no longer supported by the majority of academic historians . The empire continued to maintain a flexible and strong economy , society and military throughout the 17th and much of the 18th century . However , during a long period of peace from 1740 to 1768 , the Ottoman military system fell behind that of their European rivals , the Habsburg and Russian empires .",

The river is 110 kilometres ( 68 mi ) long , flowing through the regional units of Arcadia and Elis . Its source is near the village Dorizas , about halfway between Tripoli and Megalopoli in the highlands of Arcadia . It flows southwest toward Megalopoli , where it has been diverted around open pit lignite mines . At Thoknia it receives its right tributary Elissonas , and continues north towards Karytaina . Below Karytaina the Lousios flows into the Alfeios , and the Alfeios continues northwest , passing north of Andritsaina . Near Tripotamia the rivers Ladon and Erymanthos flow into the Alfeios . The Alfeios then flows west along Olympia and empties into the Ionian Sea south of Pyrgos . The ancient highway linking Patras and Kalamata ran along this river for most of the length east of Olympia . In Greek mythology , the Peneus and Alpheus were two rivers re-routed by Heracles in his fifth labour in order to clean the filth from the Augean Stables in a single day , a task which had been presumed to be impossible .

They continued to be celebrated when Greece came under Roman rule , until the emperor Theodosius I suppressed them in AD 393 as part of the campaign to impose Christianity as the State religion of Rome . The games were held every four years , or olympiad , which became a unit of time in historical chronologies . During the celebration of the games , an Olympic Truce was enacted so that athletes could travel from their cities to the games in safety . The prizes for the victors were olive leaf wreaths or crowns . The games became a political tool used by city-states to assert dominance over their rivals .

The period of Greek history from about 1600 BC to about 1100 BC is called Mycenaean in reference to Mycenae . At its peak in 1350 BC , the citadel and lower town had a population of 30,000 and an area of 32 hectares .

It represents the first advanced and distinctively Greek civilization in mainland Greece with its palatial states , urban organization , works of art , and writing system . The most prominent site was Mycenae , in the Argolid , after which the culture of this era is named . Other centers of power that emerged included Pylos , Tiryns , Midea in the Peloponnese , Orchomenos , Thebes , Athens in Central Greece and Iolcos in Thessaly . Mycenaean and Mycenaean-influenced settlements also appeared in Epirus , Macedonia , on islands in the Aegean Sea , on the coast of Asia Minor , the Levant , Cyprus and Italy . The Mycenaean Greeks introduced several innovations in the fields of engineering , architecture and military infrastructure , while trade over vast areas of the Mediterranean was essential for the Mycenaean economy . Their syllabic script , the Linear B , offers the first written records of the Indo-European Greek language and their religion already included several deities that can also be found in the Olympic Pantheon . Mycenaean Greece was dominated by a warrior elite society and consisted of a network of palace-centered states that developed rigid hierarchical , political , social and economic systems . At the head of this society was the king , known as wanax . Mycenaean Greece perished with the collapse of Bronze Age culture in the eastern Mediterranean , to be followed by the so-called Greek Dark Ages , a recordless transitional period leading to Archaic Greece where significant shifts occurred from palace-centralized to de-centralized forms of socio-economic organization ( including the extensive use of iron ) . Various theories have been proposed for the end of this civilization , among them the Dorian invasion or activities connected to the Sea Peoples . Additional theories such as natural disasters and climatic changes have been also suggested .",

  "/wiki/Treasury_of_Atreus": "The Treasury of Atreus or Tomb of Agamemnon is a large tholos or beehive tomb on Panagitsa Hill at Mycenae , Greece , constructed during the Bronze Age around 1250 BC . The stone lintel above the doorway weighs 120 tons , with approximate dimensions 8.3 x 5.2 x 1.2m , the largest in the world . The tomb was used for an unknown period . Mentioned by the Roman geographer Pausanias in the 2nd century AD , it was still visible in 1879 when the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann discovered the shaft graves under the agora in the Acropolis at Mycenae . The tomb perhaps held the remains of the sovereign who completed the reconstruction of the fortress or one of his successors . The grave is in the style of the other tholoi of Mycenaean Greece , of which there are nine in total around the citadel of Mycenae and many more in the Argolid . However , in its monumental shape and grandeur it is one of the most impressive monuments surviving from the Mycenaean period . The tomb has probably no relationship with either Atreus or Agamemnon - legendary rulers of Mycenae or Argos in the works of Homer , in the Epic Cycle , and the Oresteia - as archaeologists believe that the Mycenaean sovereign buried there ruled at an earlier date than king ; it was named thus by Heinrich Schliemann and the name has been used ever since .

Greek Orthodox Christianity has also traditionally placed heavy emphasis and awarded high prestige to traditions of Eastern Orthodox monasticism and asceticism , with origins in Early Christianity in the Near East and in Byzantine Anatolia . Historically , the term Greek Orthodox has also been used to describe all Eastern Orthodox Churches in general , since Greek in Greek Orthodox can refer to the heritage of the Byzantine Empire . During the first eight centuries of Christian history , most major intellectual , cultural , and social developments in the Christian Church took place within the Empire or in the sphere of its influence , where the Greek language was widely spoken and used for most theological writings . Over time , most parts of the liturgy , traditions , and practices of the church of Constantinople were adopted by all , and still provide the basic patterns of contemporary Orthodoxy . Thus , the Eastern Church came to be called Greek Orthodox in the same way that the Western Church is called Roman Catholic . However , the appellation Greek was abandoned by the Slavic and other Eastern Orthodox churches in connection with their peoples ' national awakenings , from as early as the 10th century A.D .

  "/wiki/Order_of_St_John_of_Jerusalem": "The Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem ( Latin : Ordo Fratrum Hospitalis Sancti Ioannis Hierosolymitani ) , commonly known as the Knights Hospitaller or the Order of Saint John , was a medieval and early modern Catholic military order . It was headquartered in the Kingdom of Jerusalem until 1291 , on the island of Rhodes from 1310 until 1522 , in Malta from 1530 until 1798 and at Saint Petersburg from 1799 until 1801 . Today several organizations continue the Hospitaller tradition , most importantly the Sovereign Military Order of Malta . The Hospitallers arose in the early 11th century , during the time of the Cluniac ( or Benedictine ) Reform , as a group of individuals associated with an Amalfitan hospital in the Muristan district of Jerusalem , dedicated to John the Baptist and founded around 1099 by Gerard Thom to provide care for sick , poor or injured pilgrims coming to the Holy Land . Some scholars , however , consider that the Amalfitan order and hospital were different from Gerard Thom 's order and its hospital . After the conquest of Jerusalem in 1099 during the First Crusade , the organisation became a military religious order under its own papal charter , charged with the care and defence of the Holy Land . Following the conquest of the Holy Land by Islamic forces , the knights operated from Rhodes , over which they were sovereign , and later from Malta , where they administered a vassal state under the Spanish viceroy of Sicily . The Hospitallers were one of the smallest groups to briefly colonise parts of the Americas : they acquired four Caribbean islands in the mid-17th century , which they turned over to France in the 1660s . The knights became divided during the Protestant Reformation , when rich commanderies of the order in northern Germany and the Netherlands became Protestant and largely separated from the Roman Catholic main stem , remaining separate to this day , although ecumenical relations between the descendant chivalric orders are amicable . The order was suppressed in England , Denmark , as well as in some other parts of northern Europe , and it was further damaged by Napoleon 's capture of Malta in 1798 , following which it became dispersed throughout Europe .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_art": "Gothic art was a style of medieval art that developed in Northern France out of Romanesque art in the 12th century AD , led by the concurrent development of Gothic architecture . It spread to all of Western Europe , and much of Southern and Central Europe , never quite effacing more classical styles in Italy . In the late 14th century , the sophisticated court style of International Gothic developed , which continued to evolve until the late 15th century . In many areas , especially Germany , Late Gothic art continued well into the 16th century , before being subsumed into Renaissance art . Primary media in the Gothic period included sculpture , panel painting , stained glass , fresco and illuminated manuscripts . The easily recognizable shifts in architecture from Romanesque to Gothic , and Gothic to Renaissance styles , are typically used to define the periods in art in all media , although in many ways figurative art developed at a different pace . The earliest Gothic art was monumental sculpture , on the walls of Cathedrals and abbeys . Christian art was often typological in nature ( see Medieval allegory ) , showing the stories of the New Testament and the Old Testament side by side . Saints ' lives were often depicted . Images of the Virgin Mary changed from the Byzantine iconic form to a more human and affectionate mother , cuddling her infant , swaying from her hip , and showing the refined manners of a well-born aristocratic courtly lady . Secular art came into its own during this period with the rise of cities , foundation of universities , increase in trade , the establishment of a money-based economy and the creation of a bourgeois class who could afford to patronize the arts and commission works resulting in a proliferation of paintings and illuminated manuscripts . Increased literacy and a growing body of secular vernacular literature encouraged the representation of secular themes in art .",

Many Eastern Orthodox states in Eastern Europe , as well as to some degree the Muslim states of the eastern Mediterranean , preserved many aspects of the empire 's culture and art for centuries afterward . A number of states contemporary with the Byzantine Empire were culturally influenced by it , without actually being part of it ( the Byzantine commonwealth ) . These included the Rus , as well as some non-Orthodox states like the Republic of Venice , which separated from the Byzantine empire in the 10th century , and the Kingdom of Sicily , which had close ties to the Byzantine Empire and had also been a Byzantine possession until the 10th century with a large Greek-speaking population persisting into the 12th century . Other states having a Byzantine artistic tradition had oscillated throughout the Middle Ages between being part of the Byzantine empire and having periods of independence , such as Serbia and Bulgaria . After the fall of the Byzantine capital of Constantinople in 1453 , art produced by Eastern Orthodox Christians living in the Ottoman Empire was often called post-Byzantine .

The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Italy , Montenegro and Slovenia . The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands , mostly located along the Croatian part of its eastern coast . It is divided into three basins , the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest , with a maximum depth of 1,233 metres ( 4,045 ft ) . The Otranto Sill , an underwater ridge , is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas . The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto , along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western ( Italian ) coast . Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight , although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally . The Adriatic 's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean 's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean , acting as a dilution basin . The surface water temperatures generally range from 30 \u00b0C ( 86 \u00b0F ) in summer to 12 \u00b0C ( 54 \u00b0F ) in winter , significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin 's climate .

It makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey . The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , the Armenian Highlands to the east and the Aegean Sea to the west . The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the Balkan peninsula of Europe . The eastern border of Anatolia is traditionally held to be a line between the Gulf of Alexandretta and the Black Sea , bounded by the Armenian Highland to the east and Mesopotamia to the southeast . Thus , traditionally Anatolia is the territory that comprises approximately the western two-thirds of the Asian part of Turkey . Today , Anatolia is also often considered to be synonymous with Asian Turkey , which comprises almost the entire country ; its eastern and southeastern borders are widely taken to be Turkey 's eastern border . By some definitions , the Armenian Highlands lies beyond the boundary of the Anatolian plateau . The official name of this inland region is the Eastern Anatolia Region . The ancient inhabitants of Anatolia spoke the now-extinct Anatolian languages , which were largely replaced by the Greek language starting from classical antiquity and during the Hellenistic , Roman and Byzantine periods . Major Anatolian languages included Hittite , Luwian , and Lydian , among other more poorly attested relatives .

The Corinthian , with its offshoot the Composite , is the most ornate of the orders . This architectural style is characterized by slender fluted columns and elaborate capitals decorated with acanthus leaves and scrolls . There are many variations .

Lexical archaisms are single archaic words or expressions used regularly in an affair ( e.g . religion or law ) or freely ; literary archaism is the survival of archaic language in a traditional literary text such as a nursery rhyme or the deliberate use of a style characteristic of an earlier age - for example , in his 1960 novel The Sot-Weed Factor , John Barth writes in an 18th-century style .

  "/wiki/Doric_style": "The Doric order was one of the three orders of ancient Greek and later Roman architecture ; the other two canonical orders were the Ionic and the Corinthian . The Doric is most easily recognized by the simple circular capitals at the top of columns . Originating in the western Dorian region of Greece , it is the earliest and in its essence the simplest of the orders , though still with complex details in the entablature above . The Greek Doric column was fluted or smooth-surfaced , and had no base , dropping straight into the stylobate or platform on which the temple or other building stood . The capital was a simple circular form , with some mouldings , under a square cushion that is very wide in early versions , but later more restrained . Above a plain architrave , the complexity comes in the frieze , where the two features originally unique to the Doric , the triglyph and guttae , are skeuomorphic memories of the beams and retaining pegs of the wooden constructions that preceded stone Doric temples . In stone they are purely ornamental . The relatively uncommon Roman and Renaissance Doric retained these , and often introduced thin layers of moulding or further ornament , as well as often using plain columns . More often they used versions of the Tuscan order , elaborated for nationalistic reasons by Italian Renaissance writers , which is in effect a simplified Doric , with un-fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae . The Doric order was much used in Greek Revival architecture from the 18th century onwards ; often earlier Greek versions were used , with wider columns and no bases to them . Since at least Vitruvius , it has been customary for writers to associate the Doric with masculine virtues ( the Ionic representing the feminine ) .

Constantine I ( r. 324-337 ) reorganised the empire , made Constantinople the new capital and legalised Christianity . Under Theodosius I ( r. 379-395 ) , Christianity became the state religion and other religious practices were proscribed . In the reign of Heraclius ( r. 610-641 ) , the Empire 's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use in place of Latin . Although the Roman state continued and its traditions were maintained , modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome insofar as it was centred on Constantinople , oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture and characterised by Eastern Orthodox Christianity . The borders of the empire fluctuated through cycles of decline and recovery . During the reign of Justinian I ( r. 527-565 ) , the empire reached its greatest extent , after reconquering much of the historically Roman western Mediterranean coast , including North Africa , Italy and Rome , which it held for two more centuries .",

Rossiya , IPA : [ r\u0250\u02c8s\u02b2ij\u0259 ] ) , or the Russian Federation , [ e ] is a European country located in Eastern Europe with a vast expanse of territory that stretches across Northern Asia . At 17,125,200 square kilometres ( 6,612,100 sq mi ) , it is by far the largest country in the world by area , covering more than one-eighth of the Earth 's inhabited land area , spanning eleven time zones , and bordering 16 sovereign nations . The territory of Russia extends from the Baltic Sea in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east , and from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea and the Caucasus in the south . With 146.7 million inhabitants living in the country 's 85 federal subjects as of 2020 , Russia is the most populous nation in Europe and the ninth-most populous nation in the world . Russia 's capital and largest city is Moscow ; other major urban areas include Saint Petersburg , Novosibirsk , Yekaterinburg , Nizhny Novgorod , Kazan and Chelyabinsk . The East Slavs emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD . Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants , the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century . In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire , beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium . Rus ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states , until it was finally reunified by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th century . By the 18th century , the nation had greatly expanded through conquest , annexation , and exploration to become the Russian Empire , which was the third largest empire in history , stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east . Following the Russian Revolution , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) became the largest and leading constituent of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR/Soviet Union ) , the world 's first constitutionally socialist state .",

As a polity it included large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe , North Africa and West Asia ruled by emperors . From the accession of Caesar Augustus to the military anarchy of the third century , it was a principate with Italy as metropole of the provinces and its city of Rome as sole capital ( 27 BC - 286 AD ) . Although fragmented briefly during the military crisis , the empire was forcibly reassembled , then ruled by multiple emperors who shared rule over the Western Roman Empire ( based in Milan and later in Ravenna ) and over the Eastern Roman Empire ( based in Nicomedia and later in Constantinople ) . Rome remained the nominal capital of both parts until 476 AD , when it sent the imperial insignia to Constantinople ( Byzantium - Ancient Greek : \u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd , Byz\u00e1ntion ) following the capture of Ravenna by the barbarians of Odoacer and the subsequent deposition of Romulus Augustus . The fall of the Western Roman Empire to Germanic kings , along with the hellenization of the Eastern Roman Empire into the Byzantine Empire , conventionally marks the end of Ancient Rome and the beginning of the Middle Ages . The predecessor state of the Roman Empire , the Roman Republic ( which had replaced Rome 's monarchy in the 6th century BC ) became severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflicts . In the mid-1st century BC Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC . Civil wars and proscriptions continued , culminating in the victory of Octavian , Caesar 's adopted son , over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . The following year Octavian conquered Ptolemaic Egypt , ending the Hellenistic period that had begun with the conquests of Alexander the Great of Macedon in the 4th century BC . Octavian 's power then became unassailable , and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title Augustus , effectively making him the first Roman emperor . The first two centuries of the Empire saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana ( Roman Peace ) .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Philippi": "The Battle of Philippi was the final battle in the Wars of the Second Triumvirate between the forces of Mark Antony and Octavian ( of the Second Triumvirate ) and the leaders of Julius Caesar 's assassination , Brutus and Cassius in 42 BC , at Philippi in Macedonia . The Second Triumvirate declared this civil war ostensibly to avenge Julius Caesar 's assassination in 44 BC , but the underlying cause was a long-brewing conflict between the so-called Optimates and the so-called Populares . The battle , involving up to 200,000 men in one of the largest of the Roman civil wars , consisted of two engagements in the plain west of the ancient city of Philippi . The first occurred in the first week of October ; Brutus faced Octavian , while Antony 's forces fought those of Cassius . The Roman armies fought poorly , with low discipline , non-existent tactical coordination and amateurish lack of command experience evident in abundance with neither side able to exploit opportunities as they developed . At first , Brutus pushed back Octavian and entered his legions ' camp . But to the south , Cassius was defeated by Antony , and committed suicide after hearing a false report that Brutus had also failed . Brutus rallied Cassius 's remaining troops and both sides ordered their army to retreat to their camps with their spoils , and the battle was essentially a draw , but for Cassius 's suicide . A second encounter , on 23 October , finished off Brutus 's forces after a hard-fought battle . He committed suicide in turn , leaving the triumvirate in control of the Roman Republic .",
  "/wiki/Hellenistic": "The Hellenistic period covers the period of Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year . The Ancient Greek word Hellas ( \u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 , Ell\u00e1s ) is the original word for Greece , from which the word Hellenistic was derived . During the Hellenistic period Greek cultural influence and power reached the peak of its geographical expansion , being dominant in the Mediterranean World and most of West and Central Asia , even in parts of the Indian subcontinent , experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts , exploration , literature , theatre , architecture , music , mathematics , philosophy , and science . It is often considered a period of transition , sometimes even of decadence or degeneration , compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era . The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy , Alexandrian poetry , the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism , Epicureanism , and Pyrrhonism . Greek science was advanced by the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes . The religious sphere expanded to include new gods such as the Greco-Egyptian Serapis , eastern deities such as Attis and Cybele and a syncretism between Hellenistic culture and Buddhism in Bactria and Northwest India .",

  "/wiki/Roman_Forum": "The Roman Forum , also known by its Latin name Forum Romanum ( Italian : Foro Romano ) , is a rectangular forum ( plaza ) surrounded by the ruins of several important ancient government buildings at the center of the city of Rome . Citizens of the ancient city referred to this space , originally a marketplace , as the Forum Magnum , or simply the Forum . For centuries the Forum was the center of day-to-day life in Rome : the site of triumphal processions and elections ; the venue for public speeches , criminal trials , and gladiatorial matches ; and the nucleus of commercial affairs . Here statues and monuments commemorated the city 's great men . The teeming heart of ancient Rome , it has been called the most celebrated meeting place in the world , and in all history . Located in the small valley between the Palatine and Capitoline Hills , the Forum today is a sprawling ruin of architectural fragments and intermittent archaeological excavations attracting 4.5 million or more sightseers yearly . Many of the oldest and most important structures of the ancient city were located on or near the Forum . The Roman Kingdom 's earliest shrines and temples were located on the southeastern edge . These included the ancient former royal residence , the Regia ( 8th century BC ) , and the Temple of Vesta ( 7th century BC ) , as well as the surrounding complex of the Vestal Virgins , all of which were rebuilt after the rise of imperial Rome . Other archaic shrines to the northwest , such as the Umbilicus Urbis and the Vulcanal ( Shrine of Vulcan ) , developed into the Republic 's formal Comitium ( assembly area ) . This is where the Senate - as well as Republican government itself - began . The Senate House , government offices , tribunals , temples , memorials and statues gradually cluttered the area .",
  "/wiki/Early_centres_of_Christianity": "Early Christianity ( generally considered the time period from its origin to the First Council of Nicaea in 325 ) spread from the Eastern Mediterranean throughout the Roman Empire and beyond . Originally , this progression was closely connected to already established Jewish centers in the Holy Land and the Jewish diaspora . The first followers of Christianity were Jews or proselytes , commonly referred to as Jewish Christians and God-fearers . The Apostolic sees claim to have been founded by one or more of the apostles of Jesus , who are said to have dispersed from Jerusalem sometime after the crucifixion of Jesus , c. 26-36 , perhaps following the Great Commission . Early Christians gathered in small private homes , known as house churches , but a city 's whole Christian community would also be called a church - the Greek noun \u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 literally means assembly , gathering , or congregation but is translated as church in most English translations of the New Testament . Many of these Early Christians were merchants and others who had practical reasons for traveling to northern Africa , Asia Minor , Arabia , Greece , and other places . Over 40 such communities were established by the year 100 , many in Anatolia , also known as Asia Minor , such as the Seven churches of Asia . By the end of the first century , Christianity had already spread to Rome and major cities in Armenia , Greece and Syria , serving as foundations for the expansive spread of Christianity , eventually throughout the world .",

Paul is generally considered one of the most important figures of the Apostolic Age and from the mid-30s to the mid-50s AD he founded several Christian communities in Asia Minor and Europe . He took advantage of his status as both a Jew and a Roman citizen to minister to both Jewish and Roman audiences . According to the New Testament book Acts of the Apostles ( often simply called Acts ) , Paul persecuted some of the early disciples of Jesus , possibly Hellenised diaspora Jews converted to Christianity , in the area of Jerusalem prior to his conversion . [ note 1 ] In the narrative of Acts , Paul was traveling on the road from Jerusalem to Damascus on a mission to arrest them and bring them back to Jerusalem when the resurrected Jesus appeared to him in a great light . He was struck blind , but after three days his sight was restored by Ananias of Damascus and Paul began to preach that Jesus of Nazareth is the Jewish Messiah and the Son of God . [ Acts 9:20-9:21 ] Approximately half of the book of Acts deals with Paul 's life and works . Thirteen of the twenty-seven books in the New Testament have traditionally been attributed to Paul . Seven of the Pauline epistles are undisputed by scholars as being authentic , with varying degrees of argument about the remainder . Pauline authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews is not asserted in the Epistle itself and was already doubted in the 2nd and 3rd centuries . [ note 2 ] It was almost unquestioningly accepted from the 5th to the 16th centuries that Paul was the author of Hebrews , but that view is now almost universally rejected by scholars . The other six are believed by some scholars to have come from followers writing in his name , using material from Paul 's surviving letters and letters written by him that no longer survive .",
  "/wiki/Basilica": "The Latin word basilica ( derived from Greek : \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ac , Royal Stoa , the tribunal chamber of a king ) has three distinct applications in modern English . Originally , the word was used to refer to an ancient Roman public building , where courts were held , as well as serving other official and public functions . It usually had the door at one end and a slightly raised platform and an apse at the other , where the magistrate or other officials were seated . The basilica was centrally located in every Roman town , usually adjacent to the main forum . Subsequently , the basilica was not built near a forum but adjacent to a palace and was known as a palace basilica . Secondly , as the Roman Empire adopted Christianity , the major church buildings were typically constructed with this basic architectural plan and thus it became popular throughout Europe . It continues to be used in an architectural sense to describe rectangular buildings with a central nave and aisles , and usually a raised platform at the opposite end from the door . In Europe and the Americas the basilica remained the most common architectural style for churches of all Christian denominations , though this building plan has become less dominant in new buildings since the latter 20th century . Thirdly , the term refers to an official designation of a certain kind of church in the Roman Catholic Church : a large and important place of worship that has been given special ceremonial rights by the Pope , whatever its architectural plan . These are divided into : major basilicas - numbering only four , all of which are ancient churches located within Rome - and minor basilicas - found all around the world and which , as of 2019 [ update ] , number 1,810 . These major and minor basilicas are commonly simply referred to as basilicas . Some Catholic basilicas are Catholic pilgrimage sites , receiving tens of millions of visitors per year ."
