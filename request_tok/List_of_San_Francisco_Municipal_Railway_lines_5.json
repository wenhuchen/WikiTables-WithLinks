Dry winter days also tend to provide excellent weather at Ocean Beach ( especially in drought years ) . The water at Ocean Beach is noteworthy for its strong , dangerous currents and powerful waves which make it popular among serious surfers . The water is cold , due in part to a process known as upwelling , in which frigid water from below the ocean surface rises to replace the surface water that moves away from the beach as a result of the Coriolis effect . The rapid rip currents and cold water make the ocean dangerous for casual swimmers and even those who simply want to set foot in it , and swimmers have been swept away and drowned .",
