  "/wiki/News": "News is information about current events . This may be provided through many different media : word of mouth , printing , postal systems , broadcasting , electronic communication , or through the testimony of observers and witnesses to events . Common topics for news reports include war , government , politics , education , health , the environment , economy , business , fashion , and entertainment , as well as athletic events , quirky or unusual events . Government proclamations , concerning royal ceremonies , laws , taxes , public health , and criminals , have been dubbed news since ancient times . Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news , which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information . Technological and social developments , often driven by government communication and espionage networks , have increased the speed with which news can spread , as well as influenced its content . The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the newspaper , which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread , with paper and printing press , to Europe .",
  "/wiki/Talk_radio": "Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues and consisting entirely or almost entirely of original spoken word content rather than outside music . Most shows are regularly hosted by a single individual , and often feature interviews with a number of different guests . Talk radio typically includes an element of listener participation , usually by broadcasting live conversations between the host and listeners who call in ( usually via telephone ) to the show . Listener contributions are usually screened by a show 's producers in order to maximize audience interest and , in the case of commercial talk radio , to attract advertisers . Generally , the shows are organized into segments , each separated by a pause for advertisements ; however , in public or non-commercial radio , music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments . Variations of talk radio include conservative talk , hot talk , liberal talk ( increasingly known as progressive talk ) and sports talk . While talk radio has historically been associated with broadcast radio , starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of live Internet website streaming and podcasts . Now , it is possible for an individual to use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station . In addition , TV programming from talk and news outlets such as BBC , CNN , Bloomberg and Fox is now often available expanding the world of talk radio further . Talk radio listening is enjoyed not only on radios , but a wide variety of other devices and services including PCs using iTunes , station directories such as TuneIn , show directory smartphones with apps such as Stitcher and time-shifting services like DAR.fm .",

The great majority operate as private not-for-profit corporations . [ citation needed ] Public broadcasting may be nationally or locally operated , depending on the country and the station . In some countries a single organization runs public broadcasting . Other countries have multiple public-broadcasting organizations operating regionally or in different languages .

  "/wiki/Soft_adult_contemporary": "In North American music , adult contemporary music ( AC ) is a form of radio-played popular music , ranging from 1960s vocal and 1970s soft rock music to predominantly ballad-heavy music of the present day , with varying degrees of easy listening , pop , soul , rhythm and blues , quiet storm , and rock influence . Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music . Adult contemporary tends to have lush , soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated . It is usually melodic enough to get a listener 's attention , and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music . Like most of pop music , its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse-chorus structure . The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments ( though bass guitar is usually used ) such as acoustic guitars , pianos , saxophones , and sometimes an orchestral set . The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched . However , recent adult contemporary music may feature synthesizers ( and other electronics , such as drum machines ) . An AC radio station may play mainstream music , but it excludes hip hop , dance tracks , hard rock , and some forms of teen pop , as these are less popular among adults , the target demographic . AC radio often targets the 25-44 age group , the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s . A common practice in recent years of adult contemporary stations is to play less newer music and more hits of the past . This de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart .",

Campus radio stations are generally licensed and regulated by national governments , and have very different characteristics from one country to the next . One commonality between many radio stations regardless of their physical location is a willingness - or , in some countries , even a licensing requirement - to broadcast musical selections that are not categorized as commercial hits . Because of this , campus radio has come to be associated with emerging musical trends , including genres such as punk and new wave , alternative rock , indie rock and hip hop , long before those genres become part of the musical mainstream . Campus radio stations also often provide airplay and promotional exposure to new and emerging local artists .

A number of these radio stations have gained critical acclaim for their programming and are considered by the community in which they are embedded to be an essential media outlet .
