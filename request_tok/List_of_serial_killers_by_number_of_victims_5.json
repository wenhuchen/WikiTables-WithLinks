  "/wiki/Murder,_Inc.": "Murder , Inc. ( Murder Incorporated ) was an organized crime group in the 1930s and 40s that acted as the enforcement arm of the Italian-American Mafia , Jewish mob , and connected organized crime groups in New York City and elsewhere . The groups were largely composed of Italian-American and Jewish-American gangsters from the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Brownsville , East New York , and Ocean Hill . Originally headed by Louis Lepke Buchalter , and later by the most feared mob boss Albert The Mad Hatter Anastasia , Murder , Inc. was believed to be responsible for between 400 and 1,000 contract killings , until the group was exposed in the early 1940s by former group member Abe Kid Twist Reles . In the trials that followed , many members were convicted and executed , and Abe Reles himself died after suspiciously falling from a window . Thomas E. Dewey first came to prominence as a prosecutor of Murder , Inc. and other organized crime cases .",
  "/wiki/United_States": "The United States of America ( USA ) , commonly known as the United States ( U.S. or US ) or America , is a country consisting of 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . [ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

  "/wiki/Italian-American_Mafia": "The American Mafia , commonly referred to as the Mafia or sometimes the Mob , and the Italian-American Mafia , is a highly organized Italian-American criminal society . The organization is often referred to by its members as Cosa Nostra ( Italian pronunciation : [ \u02c8k\u0254\u02d0za \u02c8n\u0254stra , \u02c8k\u0254\u02d0sa - ] , our thing ) and by the government as La Cosa Nostra ( LCN ) . The organization 's name is derived from the original Mafia or Cosa nostra , the Sicilian Mafia , with American Mafia originally referring simply to Mafia groups from Sicily operating in America , as the organization originally emerged as an off shoot of the Sicilian Mafia ; however , the organization eventually encompassed or absorbed other Italian-American gangsters and Italian crime groups ( such as the American Camorra ) living in the United States and Canada that were not of Sicilian origin . It is often colloquially referred to as the Italian Mafia or Italian Mob , though these terms may also apply to the separate yet related Sicilian Mafia or other organized crime groups in Italy . The Mafia in the United States emerged in impoverished Italian immigrant neighborhoods or ghettos in New York 's East Harlem ( or Italian Harlem ) , the Lower East Side , and Brooklyn . It also emerged in other areas of the East Coast of the United States and several other major metropolitan areas ( such as New Orleans and Chicago ) during the late 19th century and early 20th century , following waves of Italian immigration especially from Sicily and other regions of Southern Italy . It has its roots in the Sicilian Mafia but is a separate organization in the United States . Neapolitan , Calabrian , and other Italian criminal groups in the U.S. , as well as independent Italian-American criminals , eventually merged with Sicilian Mafiosi to create the modern pan-Italian Mafia in North America . Today , the American Mafia cooperates in various criminal activities with Italian organized crime groups , such as the Sicilian Mafia , the Camorra of Naples , and the 'Ndrangheta of Calabria . The most important unit of the American Mafia is that of a family , as the various criminal organizations that make up the Mafia are known . Despite the name of family to describe the various units , they are not familial groupings . The Mafia is currently most active in the northeastern United States , with the heaviest activity in New York City , and with a substantial presence in Philadelphia , New Jersey , Buffalo and New England , in areas such as Boston , Providence and Hartford .",

  "/wiki/Arsenic": "Arsenic is a chemical element with the symbol As and atomic number 33 . Arsenic occurs in many minerals , usually in combination with sulfur and metals , but also as a pure elemental crystal . Arsenic is a metalloid . It has various allotropes , but only the gray form , which has a metallic appearance , is important to industry . The primary use of arsenic is in alloys of lead ( for example , in car batteries and ammunition ) . Arsenic is a common n-type dopant in semiconductor electronic devices , and the optoelectronic compound gallium arsenide is the second most commonly used semiconductor after doped silicon . Arsenic and its compounds , especially the trioxide , are used in the production of pesticides , treated wood products , herbicides , and insecticides . These applications are declining due to the toxicity of arsenic and its compounds . A few species of bacteria are able to use arsenic compounds as respiratory metabolites . Trace quantities of arsenic are an essential dietary element in rats , hamsters , goats , chickens , and presumably other species . A role in human metabolism is not known . However , arsenic poisoning occurs in multicellular life if quantities are larger than needed .",
  "/wiki/Life_insurance": "Life insurance ( or life assurance , especially in the Commonwealth of Nations ) is a contract between an insurance policy holder and an insurer or assurer , where the insurer promises to pay a designated beneficiary a sum of money ( the benefit ) in exchange for a premium , upon the death of an insured person ( often the policy holder ) . Depending on the contract , other events such as terminal illness or critical illness can also trigger payment . The policy holder typically pays a premium , either regularly or as one lump sum . Other expenses , such as funeral expenses , can also be included in the benefits . Life policies are legal contracts and the terms of the contract describe the limitations of the insured events . Specific exclusions are often written into the contract to limit the liability of the insurer ; common examples are claims relating to suicide , fraud , war , riot , and civil commotion . Modern life insurance bears some similarity to the asset management industry and life insurers have diversified their products into retirement products such as annuities .

  "/wiki/Electric_chair": "Execution by electrocution , performed using an electric chair , is a method of execution originating in ( and almost exclusively employed in ) the United States in which the condemned person is strapped to a specially built wooden chair and electrocuted through electrodes fastened on the head and leg . This execution method , conceived in 1881 by a Buffalo , New York , dentist named Alfred P. Southwick , was developed throughout the 1880s as a humane alternative to hanging , and first used in 1890 . This execution method has been used in the United States and for a period of several decades , in the Philippines . While death was originally theorized to result from damage to the brain , it was eventually shown in 1899 that it primarily results from ventricular fibrillation and eventual cardiac arrest . Once the person was attached to the chair , various cycles ( changes in voltage and duration ) of alternating current would be passed through the individual 's body in order to cause fatal damage to the internal organs . The first , more powerful jolt of electric current is intended to cause immediate unconsciousness , ventricular fibrillation , and eventual cardiac arrest . The second , less powerful jolt is intended to cause fatal damage to the vital organs . Although the electric chair has long been a symbol of the death penalty in the United States , its use is in decline due to the rise of lethal injection , which is widely believed to be a more humane method of execution . While some states still maintain electrocution as a method of execution , today it is only maintained as a secondary method that may be chosen over lethal injection at the request of the prisoner , except in Tennessee , where it may be used without input from the prisoner if the drugs for lethal injection are not available . As of 2014 , electrocution is an optional form of execution in the states of Alabama , Florida , South Carolina , and Virginia , all of which allow the prisoner to choose lethal injection as an alternative method . In the state of Kentucky , the electric chair has been retired , except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to March 31 , 1998 , and who choose electrocution ; inmates who do not choose electrocution and inmates who committed their crimes after the designated date are executed by lethal injection . Electrocution is also authorized in Kentucky in the event that lethal injection is found unconstitutional by a court .",

The Principality of Hungary emerged as a Christian kingdom upon the coronation of the first king Stephen I at Esztergom around the year 1000 ; his family ( the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty ) led the monarchy for 300 years . By the 12th century , the kingdom became a European middle power within the Western world . Due to the Ottoman occupation of the central and southern territories of Hungary in the 16th century , the country was partitioned into three parts : the Habsburg Royal Hungary , Ottoman Hungary , and the semi-independent Principality of Transylvania . The House of Habsburg held the Hungarian throne after the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs until 1918 and also played a key role in the liberation wars against the Ottoman Empire . From 1867 , territories connected to the Hungarian crown were incorporated into Austria-Hungary under the name of Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen . The monarchy ended with the deposition of the last king Charles IV in 1918 , after which Hungary became a republic . The kingdom was nominally restored during the Regency of 1920-46 , ending under the Soviet occupation in 1946 . The Kingdom of Hungary was a multiethnic state from its inception until the Treaty of Trianon and it covered what is today Hungary , Slovakia , Transylvania and other parts of Romania , Carpathian Ruthenia ( now part of Ukraine ) , Vojvodina ( now part of Serbia ) , the territory of Burgenland ( now part of Austria ) , Me\u0111imurje ( now part of Croatia ) , Prekmurje ( now part of Slovenia ) and a few villages in Poland .

  "/wiki/Midwife": "A midwife is a health professional who cares for mothers and newborns around childbirth , a specialization known as midwifery . The education and training for a midwife is similar to that of a nurse , in contrast to obstetricians and perinatologists who are physicians ( doctors ) . In many countries , midwifery is either a branch of nursing or has some links to nursing such as a shared regulatory body , though others regard them as entirely separate professions . Midwives are trained to recognize variations from the normal progress of labor and understand how to deal with deviations from normal . They may intervene in high risk situations such as breech births , twin births , and births where the baby is in a posterior position , using non-invasive techniques . For complications related to pregnancy and birth that are beyond the midwife 's scope of practice , including surgical and instrumental deliveries , they refer their patients to physicians or surgeons . In many parts of the world , these professions work in tandem to provide care to childbearing women . In others , only the midwife is available to provide care , and in yet other countries , many women elect to utilize obstetricians primarily over midwives . Many developing countries are investing money and training for midwives , sometimes by upskilling those people already practicing as traditional birth attendants .

  "/wiki/Cult": "In modern English , a cult is a social group that is defined by its unusual religious , spiritual , or philosophical beliefs , or by its common interest in a particular personality , object or goal . This sense of the term is controversial and it has divergent definitions both in popular culture and academia and it has also been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study . It is usually considered pejorative . In the sociological classifications of religious movements , a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices , although this is often unclear . Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults , saying that they arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices . Groups said to be cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions . Beginning in the 1930s , cults became the object of sociological study in the context of the study of religious behavior . From the 1940s the Christian countercult movement has opposed some sects and new religious movements , and it labelled them as cults for their un-Christian unorthodox beliefs . The secular anti-cult movement began in the 1970s and it opposed certain groups , often charging them with mind control and partly motivated in reaction to acts of violence committed by some of their members . Some of the claims and actions of the anti-cult movement have been disputed by scholars and by the news media , leading to further public controversy . An older sense of the word cult is a set of religious devotional practices that are conventional within their culture and related to a particular figure , and often associated with a particular place . References to the cult of , for example , a particular Catholic saint , or the imperial cult of ancient Rome , use this sense of the word .",
  "/wiki/Human_sacrifice": "Human sacrifice is the act of killing one or more humans , usually as an offering to a deity , as part of a ritual . Human sacrifice has been practiced in various cultures throughout history . Victims were typically ritually killed in a manner intended to please or appease gods , spirits or the deceased , for example , as a propitiatory offering or as a retainer sacrifice when a king 's servants are killed in order for them to continue to serve their master in the next life . Closely related practices found in some tribal societies are cannibalism and headhunting . By the Iron Age , with the associated developments in religion ( the Axial Age ) , human sacrifice was becoming less common throughout the Old World , and came to be looked down upon as barbaric in classical antiquity . In the New World , however , human sacrifice continued to be widespread to varying degrees until the European colonization of the Americas . In modern times , even the practice of animal sacrifice has disappeared from some religions , and human sacrifice has become extremely rare . Most religions condemn the practice , and modern secular laws treat it as murder . In a society which condemns human sacrifice , the term ritual murder is used .",

  "/wiki/Satanism": "Satanism is a group of ideological and philosophical beliefs based on Satan . Contemporary religious practice of Satanism began with the founding of the Church of Satan in 1966 , although a few historical precedents exist . Prior to the public practice , Satanism existed primarily as an accusation by various Christian groups toward perceived ideological opponents , rather than a self-identity . Satanism , and the concept of Satan , has also been used by artists and entertainers for symbolic expression . Accusations that various groups have been practicing Satanism have been made throughout much of Christian history . During the Middle Ages , the Inquisition attached to the Catholic Church alleged that various heretical Christian sects and groups , such as the Knights Templar and the Cathars , performed secret Satanic rituals . In the subsequent Early Modern period , belief in a widespread Satanic conspiracy of witches resulted in mass trials of alleged witches across Europe and the North American colonies . Accusations that Satanic conspiracies were active , and behind events such as Protestantism ( and conversely , the Protestant claim that the Pope was the Antichrist ) and the French Revolution continued to be made in Christendom during the eighteenth to the twentieth century . The idea of a vast Satanic conspiracy reached new heights with the influential Taxil hoax of France in the 1890s , which claimed that Freemasonry worshiped Satan , Lucifer , and Baphomet in their rituals . In the 1980s and 1990s , the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria spread through the United States and the United Kingdom , amid fears that groups of Satanists were regularly sexually abusing and murdering children in their rites . In most of these cases , there is no corroborating evidence that any of those accused of Satanism were actually practitioners of a Satanic religion or guilty of the allegations leveled at them . Since the 19th century , various small religious groups have emerged that identify as Satanists or use Satanic iconography .",

According to Craig Cooley , one of Malvo 's defense attorneys , Malvo believed Muhammad when he told him that the $ 10 million ransom sought from the US government to stop the sniper killings would be used to establish a Utopian society for 140 homeless black children on a Canadian compound . In 2012 , Malvo claimed that he was sexually abused by John Allen Muhammad .",
  "/wiki/Beltway_sniper_attacks": "The D.C. sniper attacks ( also known as the Beltway sniper attacks ) were a series of coordinated shootings that occurred during three weeks in October 2002 in the District of Columbia , Maryland , and Virginia . Ten people were killed and three others were critically wounded in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area and along Interstate 95 in Virginia . The snipers were John Allen Muhammad ( aged 41 at the time ) and Lee Boyd Malvo ( aged 17 at the time ) , who traveled in a blue 1990 Chevrolet Caprice sedan . Their crime spree , begun in February 2002 , included murders and robberies in the states of Alabama , Arizona , Florida , Georgia , Louisiana , Texas , and Washington , which resulted in seven deaths and seven wounded people ; in ten months , the snipers killed 17 people and wounded 10 others . In September 2003 , Muhammad was sentenced to death , and in October , the juvenile , Malvo , was sentenced to six consecutive life sentences without parole . In November 2009 , Muhammad was put to death by lethal injection . In 2017 , the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit vacated Malvo 's three life sentences without parole in Virginia on appeal , with re-sentencing ordered pursuant to the Supreme Court 's ruling in the case of Miller v. Alabama , 567 U.S. 460 , 132 S.Ct . 2455 ( 2012 ) , which held that mandatory life sentences for juvenile criminals without possibility of parole violated the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution . The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari , with oral arguments held on October 16 , 2019 . Should he be resentenced , Malvo 's minimum prison sentence will be determined by a judge ; the available maximum sentence would be life imprisonment . The ruling does not apply to the six life sentences Malvo received in Maryland ."
