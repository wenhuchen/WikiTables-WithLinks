  "/wiki/Blakedown_railway_station": "Blakedown railway station serves the English village of Blakedown , Worcestershire . It was opened ( as Churchill station ) in 1852 , later becoming known for a time as Churchill & Blakedown after the two villages became a single parish . The station is unstaffed , with only a basic shelter on each platform . There is a level crossing immediately to the west of the platforms , and in the absence of a footbridge or subway this is also the only method for passengers to cross the tracks . The platforms were lengthened in the 1990s to allow longer trains to call ( see image - the hollow space and the white fence mark the extension ) . This is because Blakedown is within the Birmingham commuter band and over the twenty years between 1998 - 2018 usage of the station has increased by 147% . Currently there is a proposal to develop a car park on an adjacent field site to cater for further anticipated growth . Since August 2012 the signalling system has been altered , with the former signal box having been closed and control of the nearby crossing and signals transferred to the West Midlands SCC at Saltley .
