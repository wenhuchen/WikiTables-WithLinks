  "intro": "England were represented at the 2010 Commonwealth Games by Commonwealth Games England. The country used: the abbreviation ENG, the Cross of St George as its flag and Jerusalem as its victory anthem. England had previously used Land of Hope and Glory as its anthem at the Commonwealth Games, but decided to change following an internet poll. England's delegation is notable for including two Paralympic champions, who qualified to compete in Delhi against fully able-bodied athletes: Danielle Brown, who won a gold medal in archery at the 2008 Summer Paralympics, and Sarah Storey, who won two gold medals in cycling in 2008. They are the first English athletes with disabilities ever to compete in able-bodied events at the Commonwealth Games."
