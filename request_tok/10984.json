  "/wiki/La_Grange_Rock_Shelter": "The LaGrange Rock Shelter is an archaeological site located on private property between Leighton and Muscle Shoals in Colbert County , Alabama near the original campus of LaGrange College . The shelter measures 70 feet long by 15 feet deep ( 21m by 4.5m ) and is located beneath a sandstone outcrop overlooking a dense series of Paleoindian sites in the valley below , which may have led to it being chosen for excavation . Excavations of the site occurred over two seasons , beginning in 1972 with Charles Hubbert as principal investigator and ending in 1975 with Vernon J. Knight Jr as principal investigator , with both seasons under the direction of David L. DeJarnette of the University of Alabama . Lower levels of the shelter produced charcoal samples that were radiocarbon dated to approximately 11,280 BC , placing estimates of the site 's habitation within what is believed to be the Paleoindian Period . At the time of the discovery , only one other site east of the Mississippi River had been dated to that age . The charcoal consisted of small flecks associated with light debitage below a definitive Early Archaic to Late Paleoindian ( Dalton culture ) zone . After careful consideration , DeJarnette and Knight suggested that the charcoal originated from an upper level and migrated to the lower level due to breakdown of the original shelter floor . Although the Paleoindian date may be questioned , the site also contained a remarkable Early Archaic burial , one of the oldest burials uncovered in the State of Alabama . The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 .",
