  "/wiki/Big_Sur": "Big Sur is a rugged and mountainous section of the Central Coast of California between Carmel Highlands and San Simeon , where the Santa Lucia Mountains rise abruptly from the Pacific Ocean . It is frequently praised for its dramatic scenery . Big Sur has been called the longest and most scenic stretch of undeveloped coastline in the contiguous United States , a national treasure that demands extraordinary procedures to protect it from development and one of the most beautiful coastlines anywhere in the world , an isolated stretch of road , mythic in reputation . The stunning views , redwood forests , hiking , beaches , and other recreational opportunities have made Big Sur a popular destination for about 7 million people who live within a day 's drive and visitors from across the world . The region receives about the same number of visitors as Yosemite National Park , but offers extremely limited bus service , few restrooms , and a narrow two-lane highway with few places to park alongside the road . North-bound traffic during the peak summer season and holiday weekends is often backed up for about 20 miles ( 32 km ) from Big Sur Village to Carmel . The unincorporated region encompassing Big Sur does not have specific boundaries , but is generally considered to include the 71-mile ( 114 km ) segment of California State Route 1 between Malpaso Creek near Carmel Highlands in the north and San Carp\u00f3foro Creek near San Simeon in the south , as well as the entire Santa Lucia range between these creeks . The interior region is mostly uninhabited , while the coast remains relatively isolated and sparsely populated , with between 1,800 and 2,000 year-round residents and relatively few visitor accommodations scattered among four small settlements . The region remained one of the most inaccessible areas of California and the entire United States until , after 18 years of construction , the Carmel-San Simeon Highway ( now signed as part of State Route 1 ) was completed in 1937 . Along with the ocean views , this winding , narrow road , often cut into the face of towering seaside cliffs , dominates the visitor 's experience of Big Sur . The highway has been closed more than 55 times by landslides , and in May 2017 , a 2,000,000-cubic-foot ( 57,000 m3 ) slide blocked the highway at Mud Creek , north of Salmon Creek near the San Luis Obispo County line , to just south of Gorda . The road was reopened on July 18 , 2018 ."
