  "/wiki/Vermont_Republic": "Vermont Republic is a term used since the 20th century to refer to the government of Vermont from 1777 to 1791 . In January 1777 , delegates from 28 towns met and declared independence from the jurisdictions and land claims of the British colony of Quebec , and from the American states of New Hampshire and New York . They called this territory New Connecticut ( see Connecticut River ) and sometimes referred to it by the name of the Green Mountains . The delegates also abolished adult slavery within their republic . Many Vermonters took part in the American Revolution , even though the Continental Congress did not recognize the jurisdiction 's independence . Because of objections from New York , which had conflicting property claims , the Continental Congress declined to recognize Vermont , then sometimes also known as the New Hampshire Grants . Vermont 's overtures to join the Province of Quebec were accepted by the British , offering generous terms for the Republic 's reunion . When the main British army surrendered in 1781 , however , American independence became apparent . Vermont , now bordered on three sides by American territory , rejected the British claims and instead negotiated terms to enter the United States . In 1791 , Vermont officially joined the United States as the 14th state . Vermont coined a currency called Vermont coppers from a mint operated by Reuben Harmon in East Rupert ( 1785-1788 ) , and operated a postal system . While the Vermont coppers bore the legend Vermontis .",
  "/wiki/Elizabeth_Freeman_(Mum_Bett)": "Elizabeth Freeman ( c.1744 - December 28 , 1829 ) , also known as Bet , Mum Bett , or MumBet , was the first enslaved African American to file and win a freedom suit in Massachusetts . The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling , in Freeman 's favor , found slavery to be inconsistent with the 1780 Massachusetts State Constitution . Her suit , Brom and Bett v. Ashley ( 1781 ) , was cited in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court appellate review of Quock Walker 's freedom suit . When the court upheld Walker 's freedom under the state 's constitution , the ruling was considered to have implicitly ended slavery in Massachusetts .",
  "/wiki/Quock_Walker": "Quock Walker , also known as Kwaku or Quok Walker ( b . 1753 - d. unknown ) , was an American slave who sued for and won his freedom in June 1781 in a case citing language in the new Massachusetts Constitution ( 1780 ) that declared all men to be born free and equal . The case is credited with helping abolish slavery in Massachusetts , although the 1780 constitution was never amended to explicitly prohibit the practice . Massachusetts was the first state of the union to effectively and fully abolish slavery . By the 1790 federal census , no slaves were recorded in the state .",
  "/wiki/William_Cushing": "William Cushing ( March 1 , 1732 - September 13 , 1810 ) was one of the original five associate justices of the United States Supreme Court ; confirmed by the United States Senate on September 26 , 1789 , he served until his death . His Supreme Court tenure of 20 years and 11 months was the longest among the Court 's inaugural members . In January 1796 he was nominated by President George Washington to become the Court 's Chief Justice ; though confirmed , he declined the appointment . He was the last judge in the United States to wear a full wig ( Court dress ) .",
  "/wiki/The_Guardian_of_Sally_(a_negro)_v._Beatty": "A slave owned by defendant Beatty , referred to in contemporary reports as a negro wench slave , had hired herself out for work while paying her owner an agreed-upon monthly sum as a wage . She earned more than the wage she paid to her owner and used the surplus to buy another slave girl , Sally , whom she manumitted . Following purchase and manumission , Beatty did not claim Sally as his property and did not pay taxes for her . However , when Beatty was called on after some time to produce Sally as a free person , Beatty refused ; the case was then brought to the courts .",
  "/wiki/John_Rutledge": "John Rutledge ( September 17 , 1739 - July 23 , 1800 ) was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and also its second Chief Justice . Additionally , he served as the first President of South Carolina and , later , its first Governor after the Declaration of Independence . Born in Charleston , South Carolina , Rutledge established a legal career after studying at Middle Temple in the City of London . He was the elder brother of Edward Rutledge , a signatory of the Declaration of Independence . Rutledge served as a delegate to the Stamp Act Congress , which protested taxes imposed on the Thirteen Colonies by the Parliament of Great Britain . He also served as a delegate to the Continental Congress before being elected as Governor of South Carolina . He served as governor during much of the American Revolutionary War . After briefly returning to Congress , Rutledge was appointed to the South Carolina Court of Chancery . He was a delegate to the 1787 Philadelphia Convention , which wrote the United States Constitution . During the convention , he served as Chairman of the Committee of Detail , which produced the first full draft of the Constitution . The following year he also participated in the South Carolina convention to ratify the Constitution . In 1789 , President George Washington appointed Rutledge as one of the inaugural Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States .",
  "/wiki/Hudgins_v._Wright": "Hudgins v. Wright ( 1806 ) was a freedom suit decided in the favor of the slave Jackey Wright by the Virginia Supreme Court ( then called the Court of Appeals ) . She had sued for freedom for herself and her two children based on her claim of descent from Indian women . Indian slavery had been prohibited in Virginia since 1705 . Since 1662 , slave law had incorporated the principle of partus sequitur ventrem , saying that children born in the colony took the social status of their mothers . Her master Houlder Hudgins appealed the decision , saying that Wright was enslaved based on mixed-race ancestry that included African . The case was notable for the Virginia Supreme Court 's defining a difference between presumptions about people of Indian and African descent . The noted judge George Wythe , Chancellor of the Circuit Court/Chancery Court , had ruled in Wright 's favor in the first trial , based on the presumption of persons being born free as expressed in the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights . St. George Tucker , a noted justice of the Virginia Supreme Court , participated in ruling on the appeals case . He and his fellow justices ruled that the appellant had not provided sufficient evidence to offset Wright 's claim to be of Indian descent through her maternal line , as witnesses testified about her mother and grandmother . As a result , based on the long prohibition in the colony against Indian slavery and the Wrights ' appearance as white , Jackey Wright and her two children gained their liberty .",
  "/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States": "Native Americans , also known as American Indians , Indigenous Americans and other terms , are the indigenous peoples of the United States , except Hawaii and territories of the United States . More than 570 federally recognized tribes live within the US , about half of which are associated with Indian reservations . The term American Indian excludes Native Hawaiians and some Alaskan Natives , while Native Americans ( as defined by the US Census ) are American Indians , plus Alaska Natives of all ethnicities . The US Census does not include Native Hawaiians or Chamorro , instead being included in the Census grouping of Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander . The ancestors of living Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago , possibly much earlier , from Asia via Beringia . A vast variety of peoples , societies and cultures subsequently developed . Native Americans were greatly affected by the European colonization of the Americas , which began in 1492 , and their population declined precipitously overwhelmingly due to introduced diseases as well as warfare , including biological warfare , territorial confiscation and slavery . After its creation , the United States , as part of its policy of settler colonialism , waged war and perpetrated massacres against many Native American peoples , removed them from their ancestral lands , and subjected them to one-sided treaties and to discriminatory government policies into the 20th century . Since the 1960s , Native American self-determination movements have resulted in changes to the lives of Native Americans , though there are still many contemporary issues faced by Native Americans . Today , there are over five million Native Americans in the United States , 78% of whom live outside reservations . When the United States was created , established Native American tribes were generally considered semi-independent nations , as they generally lived in communities separate from British settlers . The federal government signed treaties at a government-to-government level until the Indian Appropriations Act of 1871 ended recognition of independent native nations , and started treating them as domestic dependent nations subject to federal law .",
  "/wiki/Harry_v._Decker_&_Hopkins": "Harry v. Decker & Hopkins ( 1818 ) was a freedom suit in which the Supreme Court of Mississippi ruled that the three slaves in the case were freed based on prior residence in the Northwest Territory , established as free in 1787 . Mississippi 's court was the first in the South to rule on this issue and created a precedent in transit cases that was widely observed by slave state courts . In response to a challenge related to Virginia having ceded this territory and the defendant asserting this protected the status of slavery in the region , the court held that any state may , through its constitution , prohibit slavery within its boundaries , and also through its legislature ( as Indiana had done ) , when not constrained by the United States Constitution . Specifically , it recognized that slaves residing in the Northwest Territory became freemen per congressional passage of the Ordinance of 1787 , which prohibited slavery in the territory , and could assert their rights in the state of Mississippi 's courts .",

  "/wiki/Rachel_v._Walker": "Rachel v. Walker ( 1834 ) was a freedom suit filed by Rachel , an African-American slave , in the St. Louis Circuit Court . She petitioned for her freedom and that of her son James ( John ) Henry from William Walker ( a slave trader ) , based on having been held illegally as a slave in the free territory of Michigan by a previous master , an Army officer . Her case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Missouri , where she won . The court ruled that an Army officer forfeited his slave if he took the person to territory where slavery is prohibited . This ruling was cited as precedent in 1856 in the famous Dred Scott v. Sandford case before the Supreme Court of the United States . Rachel 's was one of 301 19th-century freedom suits found among St. Louis Circuit Court records in the 1990s ; it is the largest group of case files in the country available to researchers . The Missouri History Museum 's research center maintains a searchable database online of the freedom suits .",
  "/wiki/Freedom_suit": "Freedom suits were lawsuits in the Thirteen Colonies and the United States filed by enslaved people against slaveholders to assert claims to freedom , often based on descent from a free maternal ancestor , or time held as a resident in a free state or territory . The right to petition for freedom descended from English common law and allowed people to challenge their enslavement or indenture . Petitioners challenged slavery both directly and indirectly , even if slaveholders generally viewed such petitions as a means to uphold rather than undermine slavery . Beginning with the colonies in North America , legislatures enacted slave laws that created a legal basis for just subjection ; these were adopted or updated by the state and territorial legislatures that superseded them after the United States gained independence . These codes also enabled enslaved persons to sue for freedom based on wrongful enslavement . While some cases were tried during the colonial period , the majority of petitions for freedom were heard during the antebellum period in the border or the Southern United States . After the American Revolution , most northern states abolished slavery and were considered free . The United States Congress prohibited slavery in some newly established territories , and some new states were admitted to the union as free states . The rise in travel and migration of masters with slaves between free and slave states resulted in conditions that gave rise to slaves suing for freedom . Many free states had residency limits for masters who brought slaves into their territory ; after that time , the slave would be considered free . Some slaves sued for wrongful enslavement after being held in a free state . Other grounds for suit were that the person was freeborn and illegally held in slavery , or that the person was illegally held because of being descended from a freeborn woman in the maternal line .",

Brazealle ( 1838 ) was a case decided by the Supreme Court of Mississippi , which denied the legality in Mississippi of deeds of manumission executed by Elisha Brazealle , a Mississippi resident , in Ohio to free a slave woman and their son . Hinds ruled that Brazealle was trying to evade Mississippi law against manumissions except when authorized by the state legislature , and the actions were invalid . Both the mother and son were declared legally still slaves in Mississippi , and the son was prohibited from inheriting his father 's estate , as Brazealle had left it all to him .",

  "/wiki/United_States_v._The_Amistad": "United States v. Schooner Amistad , 40 U.S. ( 15 Pet . ) 518 ( 1841 ) , was a United States Supreme Court case resulting from the rebellion of Africans on board the Spanish schooner La Amistad in 1839 . It was an unusual freedom suit that involved international issues and parties , as well as United States law . The historian Samuel Eliot Morison described it in 1969 as the most important court case involving slavery before being eclipsed by that of Dred Scott in 1857 . The schooner was traveling along the coast of Cuba on its way to a port for re-sale of the slaves . The African captives , Mende people who had been kidnapped in the area of Sierra Leone in West Africa , illegally sold into slavery , and shipped to Cuba , escaped their shackles and took over the ship . They killed the captain and the cook ; two other crew members escaped in a lifeboat . The Mende directed the two Spanish navigator survivors to return them to Africa . The crew tricked them , sailing north at night . La Amistad was later apprehended near Long Island , New York , by the United States Revenue Cutter Service ( the predecessor of the U.S. Coast Guard ) and taken into custody . The widely publicized court cases in the United States federal district court and eventually the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington , D.C. , in 1841 , which addressed international issues , helped the abolitionist anti-slavery movement . In 1840 , a federal district court found that the transport of the kidnapped Africans across the Atlantic Ocean on the Portuguese slave ship Tecora was in violation of laws and accepted treaties against the international slave trade by Great Britain and Ireland , Spain , and the United States .",
  "/wiki/Prigg_v._Pennsylvania": "Prigg v. Pennsylvania , 41 U.S. ( 16 Pet . ) 539 ( 1842 ) , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the court held that the federal Fugitive Slave Act ( 1793 ) precluded a Pennsylvania state law that prohibited blacks from being taken out of the free state of Pennsylvania into slavery . The Court overturned the conviction of slavecatcher Edward Prigg as a result . Occurring under the presidency of John Tyler , Prigg v. Pennsylvania weakened the enforcement mechanisms of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 by allowing states to forbid their officials from cooperating in the return of fugitive slaves . But , by asserting federal government authority and responsibility over the area of fugitive slave return , it set the stage for future more stringent laws that would bypass individual state decisions about slavery . ( Northern states by this time had abolished slavery , and most prohibited slaveowners from bringing slaves to their states , saying they would be considered free if brought in state . ) Later , the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 ( part of the Compromise of 1850 ) , required even free states to support capture and return of fugitive slaves with their law enforcement , increasing penalties for non-compliance . Also , by refusing to take judicial notice of the problem of free blacks being kidnapped in free states and sold into slavery , the Prigg decision established an implicit precedent that blacks were entitled to fewer procedural protections than were whites .",
  "/wiki/Strader_v._Graham": "Strader v. Graham , 51 U.S. ( 10 How . ) 82 ( 1851 ) , was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the status of three slaves who went from Kentucky to Indiana and Ohio depended on Kentucky law rather than Ohio law . The original plaintiff was Christopher Graham , whose three slaves had traveled to Cincinnati , Ohio , aboard a steamboat owned by Jacob Strader and James Gorman and piloted by John Armstrong . The slaves later escaped to Canada . The U.S. Supreme Court recognized the authority of the Northwest Ordinance of 1789 over its applicable territories in Strader v. Graham , but did not extend the Northwest Ordinance to cover respective states which were later admitted to the Union .",
  "/wiki/Lemmon_v._New_York": "Lemmon v. New York , or Lemmon v. The People ( 1860 ) , popularly known as the Lemmon Slave Case , was a freedom suit initiated in 1852 by a petition for a writ of habeas corpus . The petition was granted by the Superior Court in New York City , a decision upheld by the New York Court of Appeals , New York 's highest court , in 1860 on the eve of the Civil War . The decision mandated the release of eight slaves , including six children , brought into New York by their Virginia slave owners while in transit during relocation to Texas . New York had abolished slavery gradually beginning in 1799 , freeing all remaining slaves on July 4 , 1827 . An 1817 state law explicitly prohibited slaveholders from bringing slaves in transit to the state , liberating any slaves so brought . Attorney John Jay ( 1817-1894 ) represented the state in the 1852 case . Future President Chester A. Arthur represented the state on appeal by the former slaveowners . Counsel to him were William M. Evarts , Joseph Blunt , and Erastus D. Culver .",
  "/wiki/Holmes_v._Ford": "Holmes v. Ford was an American court case in the Oregon Territory that freed a slave family in the territory in 1853 . The decision re-affirmed that slavery was illegal in the territory as outlined in the Organic Laws of Oregon that were continued once the region became a U.S. territory . In the decision , Chief Justice of the Oregon Territorial Supreme Court George H. Williams ruled against Nathaniel Ford , freeing the children of Polly and Robin Holmes .",
  "/wiki/Organic_Laws_of_Oregon": "The Organic Laws of Oregon were two sets of legislation passed in the 1840s by a group of primarily American settlers based in the Willamette Valley . These laws were drafted after the Champoeg Meetings and created the structure of a white government in the Oregon Country . At the last Champoeg Meeting in May 1843 , the majority of the male European descendants present voted to create what became the Provisional Government of Oregon . Laws were drafted by the committee and accepted by a popular vote in July . These laws were reformed by a second version in 1845 . The Organic Laws were based on the laws of Iowa Territory and compartmentalized the government into three branches consisting of an executive branch , a legislative branch , and a judiciary . Once the Oregon Territory was formed in 1848 , the territorial government took control of the laws and invalidated only one provision of the Organic Laws . On February 14 , 1859 , Oregon became a state and the Oregon Constitution became the legal framework for the state .",
  "/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford": "Dred Scott v. Sandford , 60 U.S. ( 19 How . ) 393 ( 1857 ) , was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court held that the Constitution of the United States was not meant to include American citizenship for black people , regardless of whether they were enslaved or free , and therefore the rights and privileges it confers upon American citizens could not apply to them . The decision was made in the case of Dred Scott , an enslaved black man whose owners had taken him from Missouri , which was a slave-holding state , into the Missouri Territory , most of which had been designated free territory by the Missouri Compromise of 1820 . When his owners later brought him back to Missouri , Scott sued in court for his freedom , claiming that because he had been taken into free U.S. territory , he had automatically been freed , and was legally no longer a slave . Scott sued first in Missouri state court , which ruled that he was still a slave under its law . He then sued in U.S. federal court , which ruled against him by deciding that it had to apply Missouri law to the case . He then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court . In March 1857 , the Supreme Court issued a 7-2 decision against Dred Scott . In an opinion written by Chief Justice Roger Taney , the Court ruled that black people are not included , and were not intended to be included , under the word 'citizens ' in the Constitution , and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the United States . Taney supported his ruling with an extended survey of American state and local laws from the time of the Constitution 's drafting in 1787 purporting to show that a perpetual and impassable barrier was intended to be erected between the white race and the one which they had reduced to slavery . Because the Court ruled that Scott was not an American citizen , any federal lawsuit he filed automatically failed because he could never establish the diversity of citizenship that Article III of the U.S. Constitution requires for an American federal court to be able to exercise jurisdiction over a case . After ruling on these issues surrounding Scott , Taney continued further and struck down the entire Missouri Compromise as a limitation on slavery that exceeded the U.S. Congress 's powers under the Constitution .",
  "/wiki/Ableman_v._Booth": "Ableman v. Booth , 62 U.S. ( 21 How . ) 506 ( 1859 ) , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that State courts can not issue rulings on federal law that contradict the decisions of federal courts , overturning a decision by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin . The U.S. Supreme Court held that under the Constitution , the federal courts have the final power to decide cases arising under the Constitution and federal statutes , and that the States do not have the power to overturn those decisions . Thus , Wisconsin did not have the authority to nullify federal judgments or statutes . For example , it is illegal for State officials to interfere with the work of U.S . Marshals acting under federal laws . The Ableman decision emphasized the dual form of American government and the independence of State and federal courts from one another .",
  "/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Law_of_1850": "The Fugitive Slave Act or Fugitive Slave Law was passed by the United States Congress on September 18 , 1850 , as part of the Compromise of 1850 between Southern slave-holding interests and Northern Free-Soilers . The Act was one of the most controversial elements of the 1850 compromise and heightened Northern fears of a slave power conspiracy . It required that all escaped slaves , upon capture , be returned to their masters and that officials and citizens of free states had to cooperate . Abolitionists nicknamed it the Bloodhound Law , for the dogs that were used to track down runaway slaves ."
