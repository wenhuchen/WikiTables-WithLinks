As tensions and violence increased , Governor Harrison marched with an army of about 1,000 men to disperse the confederacy 's headquarters at Prophetstown , near the confluence of the Tippecanoe River and the Wabash River . Tecumseh was not yet ready to oppose the United States by force and was away recruiting allies when Harrison 's army arrived . Tenskwatawa was a spiritual leader but not a military man , and he was in charge . Harrison camped near Prophetstown on November 6 and arranged to meet with Tenskwatawa the following day . Early the next morning , however , warriors from Prophetstown attacked Harrison 's army . They took the army by surprise , but Harrison and his men stood their ground for more than two hours . The Indians were ultimately repulsed when their ammunition ran low . After the battle , they abandoned Prophetstown and Harrison 's men burned it to the ground , destroying the food supplies stored for the winter . The soldiers then returned to their homes . Harrison accomplished his goal of destroying Prophetstown and proclaimed that he had won a decisive victory . He gained the nickname Tippecanoe , which was popularized in the campaign song Tippecanoe and Tyler too during the presidential election of 1840 which Harrison won .",
  "/wiki/Congressional_Gold_Medal": "A Congressional Gold Medal is an award bestowed by the United States Congress . The congressional practice of issuing gold medals to occasionally honor recipients from the military began during the American Revolution . Later the practice extended to individuals in all walks of life and in the late 20th century also to groups . The Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom are the highest civilian awards in the United States . The congressional medal seeks to honor those , individually or as a group , who have performed an achievement that has an impact on American history and culture that is likely to be recognized as a major achievement in the recipient 's field long after the achievement . However , There are no permanent statutory provisions specifically relating to the creation of Congressional Gold Medals . When a Congressional Gold Medal has been deemed appropriate , Congress has , by legislative action , provided for the creation of a medal on an ad hoc basis . Thus , there are generally fewer gold medals than presidential medals . U.S. citizenship is not a requirement . As of April 4 , 2019 , 163 institutions , people , or events have been awarded a Congressional Gold Medal .",

  "/wiki/War_of_1812": "The War of 1812 was a conflict fought between the United States and the United Kingdom , with their respective allies , from June 1812 to February 1815 . Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars ; historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right . From the outbreak of war with Napoleonic France , Britain had enforced a naval blockade to choke off neutral trade to France , which the US contested as illegal under international law . To man the blockade , Britain pressed American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy . American sentiment grew increasingly hostile toward Britain due to incidents such as the Chesapeake-Leopard affair , which happened five years before the war . The British were in turn outraged by the Little Belt affair in 1811 , in which 11 British sailors died . Britain supplied arms to American Indians who raided American settlers on the frontier , hindering American expansion and provoking resentment . Historians debate whether the desire to annex some or all of British North America ( Canada ) contributed to the American decision to go to war . However , the Western interest was in expansion into American territories such as Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , and Wisconsin , where they were threatened by Indians supported by the British . On June 18 , 1812 , President James Madison signed into law the American declaration of war , after heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress . With most of its army in Europe fighting Napoleon , Britain adopted a defensive strategy , with offensive operations initially limited to the border and the western frontier . American prosecution of the war effort suffered from its unpopularity , especially in New England , where it was referred to as Mr. Madison 's War .",
  "/wiki/Board_of_Visitors": "In the United States , a board often governs institutions of higher education , including private universities , state universities and community colleges . In each US state , such boards may govern either the state university system , individual colleges and universities , or both .

[ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War .

  "/wiki/Edmund_Ruffin": "Edmund Ruffin ( January 5 , 1794 - June 18 , 1865 ) was a wealthy Virginia planter and slaveholder . In the last three decades before the Civil War , his pro-slavery writings received more attention than his agricultural work . Ruffin staunchly advocated states ' rights and slavery , arguing for secession years before the American Civil War and became a political activist with the so-called Fire-Eaters . Ruffin is given credit for firing the first shot of the war at the Battle of Fort Sumter in April 1861 and fought as a Confederate soldier despite his advanced age . When the war ended in Southern defeat in 1865 , he committed suicide rather than submit to Yankee rule . Ruffin 's chief legacy may be his pioneering work in methods to preserve and improve soil productivity . He recommended crop rotation and additions to restore soils exhausted from tobacco monoculture . Early in his career , he studied bogs and swamps to learn how to correct soil acidity . He published essays and , in 1832 , a book on his findings for improving soils . He has since become known as the father of soil science in the United States .",
  "/wiki/Fort_Sumter": "Fort Sumter is a sea fort in Charleston , South Carolina , notable for two battles , the first of which signified the start of the American Civil War . It was one of a number of special forts planned after the War of 1812 , combining high walls and heavy masonry , and classified as Third System , as a grade of structural integrity . Work started in 1829 , but was incomplete by 1860 , when South Carolina seceded from the Union . The First Battle of Fort Sumter began on April 12 , 1861 , when Confederate artillery fired on the Union garrison . These were the first shots of the war and continued all day , watched by many civilians in a celebratory spirit . The fort had been cut off from its supply line and surrendered the next day . The Second Battle of Fort Sumter ( September 8 , 1863 ) was a failed attempt by the Union to retake the fort , dogged by a rivalry between army and navy commanders . Although the fort was reduced to rubble , it remained in Confederate hands until it was evacuated as General Sherman marched through South Carolina in February 1865 . Fort Sumter is open for public tours as part of the Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie National Historical Park operated by the National Park Service .",
  "/wiki/Winfield_Scott": "Winfield Scott ( June 13 , 1786 - May 29 , 1866 ) was an American military commander and political candidate . He served as a general in the United States Army from 1814 to 1861 , taking part in the War of 1812 , the Mexican-American War , the early stages of the American Civil War , and various conflicts with Native Americans . Scott was the Whig Party 's presidential nominee in the 1852 presidential election , but was defeated by Democrat Franklin Pierce . He was known as Old Fuss and Feathers for his insistence on proper military etiquette , and as the Grand Old Man of the Army for his many years of service . Scott was born near Petersburg , Virginia , in 1786 . After training as a lawyer , he joined the army in 1808 as a captain of the light artillery . In the War of 1812 , Scott served on the Canadian front , taking part in the Battle of Queenston Heights and the Battle of Fort George , and was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in early 1814 . He served with distinction in the Battle of Chippawa , but was badly wounded in the subsequent Battle of Lundy 's Lane . After the conclusion of the war , Scott was assigned to command army forces in a district containing much of the Northeastern United States , and he and his family made their home near New York City . During the 1830s , Scott negotiated an end to the Black Hawk War , took part in the Second Seminole War and the Creek War of 1836 , and presided over the removal of the Cherokee . Scott also helped to avert war with Britain , defusing tensions arising from the Patriot War and the Aroostook War . In 1841 , Scott became the Commanding General of the United States Army , beating out his rival , Edmund P. Gaines , for the position .",
  "/wiki/Black_Hawk_War": "The Black Hawk War was a brief conflict between the United States and Native Americans led by Black Hawk , a Sauk leader . The war erupted soon after Black Hawk and a group of Sauks , Meskwakis , and Kickapoos , known as the British Band , crossed the Mississippi River , into the U.S. state of Illinois , from Iowa Indian Territory in April 1832 . Black Hawk 's motives were ambiguous , but he was apparently hoping to avoid bloodshed while resettling on tribal land that had been ceded to the United States in the disputed 1804 Treaty of St. Louis . U.S. officials , convinced that the British Band was hostile , mobilized a frontier militia and opened fire on a delegation from the Native Americans on May 14 , 1832 . Black Hawk responded by successfully attacking the militia at the Battle of Stillman 's Run . He led his band to a secure location in what is now southern Wisconsin and was pursued by U.S. forces . Meanwhile , other Native Americans conducted raids against forts and settlements largely unprotected with the absence of U.S. troops . Some Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi warriors with grievances against European-Americans took part in these raids , although most tribe members tried to avoid the conflict . The Menominee and Dakota tribes , already at odds with the Sauks and Meskwakis , supported the U.S. Commanded by General Henry Atkinson , the U.S. troops tracked the British Band . Militia under Colonel Henry Dodge caught up with the British Band on July 21 and defeated them at the Battle of Wisconsin Heights . Black Hawk 's band was weakened by hunger , death , and desertion and many native survivors retreated towards the Mississippi . On August 2 , U.S. soldiers attacked the remnants of the British Band at the Battle of Bad Axe , killing many and capturing most who remained alive .",
  "/wiki/Mexican\u2013American_War": "The Mexican-American War , [ a ] also known in the United States as the Mexican War and in Mexico as the Intervenci\u00f3n Estadounidense en M\u00e9xico ( American intervention in Mexico ) , [ b ] was an armed conflict between the United States and Mexico from 1846 to 1848 . It followed in the wake of the 1845 U.S. annexation of Texas , which was not formally recognized by the Mexican government , who disputed the Treaties of Velasco signed by Mexican caudillo President/General Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna after the Texas Revolution a decade earlier . In 1845 , newly elected U.S. President James K. Polk , who saw the annexation of Texas as the first step towards a further expansion of the United States , sent troops to the disputed area and a diplomatic mission to Mexico . After Mexican forces attacked U.S. forces , the United States Congress declared war . U.S. forces quickly occupied the regional capital of Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico along the upper Rio Grande and the Pacific coast province of Alta California , and then moved south . Meanwhile , the Pacific Squadron of the U.S. Navy blockaded the Pacific coast farther south in the lower Baja California Territory . The U.S. Army , under Major General Winfield Scott , eventually captured Mexico City through stiff resistance , having marched west from the port of Veracruz on the Gulf Coast , where the U.S. staged its first ever major amphibious landing . The 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , forced onto the remnant Mexican government , ended the war and enforced the Mexican Cession of the northern territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico to the United States . The U.S. agreed to pay $ 15 million in compensation for the physical damage of the war and assumed $ 3.25 million of debt already owed earlier by the Mexican government to U.S. citizens . Mexico acknowledged the loss of what became the State of Texas and accepted the Rio Grande as its northern border with the United States . The victory and territorial expansion Polk envisioned inspired great patriotism in the United States , but the war and treaty drew some criticism in the U.S. for their casualties , monetary cost , and heavy-handedness , particularly early on . The question of how to treat the new acquisitions also intensified the debate over slavery .",
  "/wiki/Union_Army": "During the American Civil War , the Union Army referred to the United States Army , the land force that fought to preserve the Union of the collective states . Also known as the Federal Army , it proved essential to the preservation of the United States as a working , viable republic . The Union Army was made up of the permanent regular army of the United States , but further fortified , augmented , and strengthened by the many temporary units of dedicated volunteers as well as including those who were drafted in to service as conscripts . To this end , the Union Army fought and ultimately triumphed over the efforts of the Confederate States Army in the American Civil War . Over the course of the war , 2,128,948 men enlisted in the Union Army , including 178,895 colored troops ; 25% of the white men who served were foreign-born . Of these soldiers , 596,670 were killed , wounded or went missing . The initial call-up was for just three months , after which many of these men chose to reenlist for an additional three years .",
  "/wiki/Anaconda_Plan": "The Anaconda Plan is the name applied to a Union Army outline strategy for suppressing the Confederacy at the beginning of the American Civil War . Proposed by Union General-in-Chief Winfield Scott , the plan emphasized a Union blockade of the Southern ports and called for an advance down the Mississippi River to cut the South in two . Because the blockade would be rather passive , it was widely derided by a vociferous faction of Union generals who wanted a more vigorous prosecution of the war and likened it to the coils of an anaconda suffocating its victim . The snake image caught on , giving the proposal its popular name . In the early days of the Civil War , Scott 's proposed strategy for the war against the South had two prominent features . First , all ports in the seceding states were to be rigorously blockaded . Secondly , a strong column of perhaps 80,000 men should use the Mississippi River as a highway to thrust completely through the Confederacy . A spearhead , a relatively-small amphibious force of army troops transported by boats and supported by gunboats , should advance rapidly , capturing the Confederate positions down the river in sequence . It would be followed by a more traditional army , marching behind to secure victories . The culminating battle would be for the forts below New Orleans . When they fell , the river would be in US hands from its source to its mouth , and the rebellion would be cut in two .",

  "/wiki/William_Henry_Harrison": "William Henry Harrison ( February 9 , 1773 - April 4 , 1841 ) was an American military officer and politician who served as the ninth president of the United States in 1841 . He died of typhoid , pneumonia or paratyphoid fever 31 days into his term ( the shortest tenure ) , becoming the first president to die in office . His death sparked a brief constitutional crisis regarding succession to the presidency , because the Constitution was unclear as to whether Vice President John Tyler should assume the office of president or merely execute the duties of the vacant office . Tyler claimed a constitutional mandate to become the new president and took the presidential oath of office , setting an important precedent for an orderly transfer of the presidency and its full powers when the previous president fails to complete the elected term . Harrison was born in Charles City County , Virginia , the son of Founding Father Benjamin Harrison V and the paternal grandfather of Benjamin Harrison , the 23rd president of the United States . He was the last president born as a British subject in the Thirteen Colonies before the start of the Revolutionary War in 1775 .

Later , he led a military force against Tecumseh 's Confederacy at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811 , where he earned the nickname Old Tippecanoe . He was promoted to major general in the Army in the War of 1812 , and in 1813 led American infantry and cavalry at the Battle of the Thames in Upper Canada .

  "/wiki/Battle_of_the_Thames": "The Battle of the Thames , also known as the Battle of Moraviantown , was a decisive American victory in the War of 1812 against Great Britain and its Indian allies in Tecumseh 's Confederacy . It took place on October 5 , 1813 in Upper Canada , near Chatham . The British lost control of Southwestern Ontario as a result of the battle ; Tecumseh and war chief Roundhead were killed , and Tecumseh 's Confederacy largely fell apart . British troops under Major General Henry Procter had occupied Detroit until the United States Navy gained control of Lake Erie , depriving them of their supplies . Procter was forced to retreat north up the Thames River to Moraviantown , followed by the tribal confederacy under Shawnee leader Tecumseh and war chief Roundhead who were his allies . American infantry and cavalry under Major General William Henry Harrison drove off the British and then defeated the Indians , who were demoralized by the deaths of Tecumseh and Roundhead in action . American control was re-established in the Detroit area , the tribal confederacy collapsed , and Procter was court-martialled for his poor leadership"
