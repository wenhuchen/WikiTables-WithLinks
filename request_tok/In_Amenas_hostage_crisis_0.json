It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",

Its population was estimated at 19,216 in 2018 . First formally settled in the mid-1891s , Katy was a railroad town along the Missouri-Kansas-Texas ( MKT ) Railroad which ran parallel to U.S. Route 90 ( today Interstate 10 ) into Downtown Houston . The fertile floodplain of Buffalo Bayou , which has its source near Katy , and its tributaries made Katy and other communities in the surrounding prairie an attractive location for rice farming . Beginning in the 1960s , the rapid growth of Houston moved westward along the new Interstate 10 corridor , bringing Katy into its environs . Today , the municipality of Katy lies at the center of a broader area known as Greater Katy , which has become heavily urbanized . While largely subsumed into Greater Houston , the town of Katy is still notable for Katy Mills Mall , the Katy Independent School District , and its historic town square along the former right-of-way of the MKT railroad .",

However , following the depletion of its tin deposits and the collapse of tin prices in the 1970s , the city suffered decades of decline and neglect . In recent years , Ipoh 's popularity as a tourist destination has been significantly boosted by efforts to conserve its British colonial-era architecture . The city is also well known for its cuisine and natural attractions , such as its limestone hills and caves within which Buddhist temples were built . In addition , Ipoh has managed to maintain its reputation as one of the cleanest cities in Malaysia . Ipoh 's location between Kuala Lumpur and George Town has made it a major land transportation hub within West Malaysia , with both the Malayan Railway 's West Coast Line and the North-South Expressway cutting through the city .

Colombia is bounded on the north by the Caribbean Sea , the northwest by Panama , the south by both Ecuador and Peru , the east by Venezuela , the southeast by Brazil , and the west by the Pacific . It comprises thirty-two departments , with the capital in Bogot\u00e1 . Colombia is ethnically and linguistically diverse , with its rich cultural heritage reflecting influences by various Amerindian civilizations , European settlement , forced African labor , and immigration from Europe and the greater Middle East . Urban centres are concentrated in the Andean highlands and the Caribbean coast . Colombia has been inhabited by various American Indian peoples since at least 12,000 BCE , including the Muisca , Quimbaya , and the Tairona . Spaniards arrived in 1499 and by the mid-16th century annexed part of the region , establishing the New Kingdom of Granada , with Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1 as its capital . Independence from Spain was achieved in 1819 , but by 1830 the Gran Colombia Federation was dissolved , with what is now Colombia and Panama emerging as the Republic of New Granada . The new sovereign state experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation ( 1858 ) , and then the United States of Colombia ( 1863 ) , before the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886 . Panama seceded in 1903 , leading to Colombia 's present borders .

Bogot\u00e1 is a territorial entity of the first order , with the same administrative status as the departments of Colombia . It is the political , economic , administrative and industrial center of the country . Bogot\u00e1 was founded as the capital of the New Kingdom of Granada on August 6 , 1538 , by Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada after a harsh expedition into the Andes conquering the Muisca . The Muisca were the indigenous inhabitants of the region , and they called the place of the foundation Thybzaca or Old Town . The name of Bogot\u00e1 corresponds to the Spanish pronunciation of the Muisca Bacat\u00e1 ( or Mueket\u00e1 ) which was the name of a neighboring settlement located between the modern towns of Funza and Cota . There are different opinions about the meaning of the word Bacat\u00e1 , the most accepted being that it means walling of the farmland in the Chibcha language . Another popular translation argues that it means The Lady of the Andes . Further , the word 'Andes ' in the Aymara language means shining mountain , thus rendering the full lexical signification of Bogot\u00e1 as The Lady of the shining mountain ( notice , however , that the language of the Muisca people was not Aymara but Chibcha ) . Others suggest that Bacat\u00e1 was the name of the Muisca cacique who governed the land before the Spaniards arrived . Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada gave the settlement the name of Our Lady of Hope but the Spanish crown gave it the name of Santaf\u00e9 ( Holy Faith ) in 1540 when it was appointed as a city . Santaf\u00e9 became the seat of the government of the Spanish Royal Audiencia of the New Kingdom of Granada ( created in 1550 ) , and then after 1717 it was the capital of the Viceroyalty of New Granada .",
