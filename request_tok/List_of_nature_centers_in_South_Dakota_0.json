  "/wiki/McCook_Lake": "McCook Lake is a natural oxbow lake found in Union County , South Dakota , United States , about one mile north of North Sioux City . It was formed from a cutoff of the Missouri River . The lake is named for General John Cook , who commanded a company of soldiers stationed there in 1862-63 following the Dakota War of 1862 . When or why the Mc was added is unknown . Most residents are located on the north side of the lake , while land around the south side is used for farming . The Izaac Walton League , an environmental organization active in lake issues , has a clubhouse located on the lake and owns most of the southern shore . The lake 's level is supported by pumping water from the Missouri River through a 24-inch pipe at the southwest end , transported over 1\u00bd miles , which costs about $ 1,000 a week . Locks were installed by the WPA at each end of the lake in the 1930s to allow for control of the lake 's level during the Missouri 's high-flow periods , but because they no longer occur , these are no longer in use . The lake level has been maintained via the pump and a well since the 1970s . In the 1950s , Missouri River flooding deposited large amounts of silt in the lake . A restoration project began in 1991 , when the lake 's average depth was 2-4 feet , to remove accumulated sediment ( mostly clay and fine sand ) of about 1,700,000 cubic yards ( 1,300,000 m3 ) from the lake 's bottom . Noting increased temperatures in the shallow lake and dense aquatic vegetation , the EPA 's total maximum daily load analysis said : The lake mimicked a prairie slough more than a lake .",

  "/wiki/East_River_(South_Dakota)": "The East River portion of South Dakota refers to the section of the state lying east of the Missouri River . Geographical distinctions between the eastern and western sections of the state were reinforced by differing patterns of European-American settlement and Native American resettlement during the 19th and 20th centuries . The eastern half of South Dakota was heavily glaciated and is largely covered by glacial till and loamy soil , which has lent itself to agricultural uses . The Missouri River roughly follows the 100th meridian in the state , and areas to the west of the meridian receive less rainfall . The East River region was generally capable of supporting homesteaders on the standard 160-acre plots of the era during the wetter-than average years between 1879 and 1885 ; prolonged droughts between 1886 and 1897 , however , severely affected the region 's farmers . During the second half of the 19th century , about 350,000 immigrants from western and northern Europe settled to the east of the Missouri . The later European immigrants , however , predominantly from southern and eastern Europe , settled in the West River region after 1889 , when the federal government made some 9 million acres of former Lakota land available for purchase after breaking up the Great Sioux Reservation , established under the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868 . It reassigned Native Americans to five smaller reservations in West River , and two in East River . About 70% of South Dakota 's population in the 1990s was located in the East River region , which includes major businesses , industries and state government . This area includes the state 's largest city , Sioux Falls , and Pierre , the state capital , located on the east bank of the Missouri River . Since the 1960s and the rise of Indian activism , numerous Native Americans have returned to the reservations in the state . In addition , they have a young population with a relatively high birth rate .",
  "/wiki/Badlands_National_Park": "Badlands National Park ( Lakota : Mak\u021f\u00f3\u0161i\u010da ) is an American national park located in southwestern South Dakota .

The National Park Service manages the park , with the South Unit being co-managed with the Oglala Lakota tribe . The Badlands Wilderness protects 64,144 acres ( 100.2 sq mi ; 259.6 km2 ) of the park as a designated wilderness area , and is one site where the black-footed ferret , one of the most endangered mammals in the world , was reintroduced to the wild . The South Unit , or Stronghold District , includes sites of 1890s Ghost Dances , a former United States Air Force bomb and gunnery range , and Red Shirt Table , the park 's highest point at 3,340 feet ( 1,020 m ) . Authorized as Badlands National Monument on March 4 , 1929 , it was not established until January 25 , 1939 . Badlands was redesignated a national park on November 10 , 1978 . Under the Mission 66 plan , the Ben Reifel Visitor Center was constructed for the monument in 1957-58 . The park also administers the nearby Minuteman Missile National Historic Site .

  "/wiki/West_River_(South_Dakota)": "West River is the portion of the state of South Dakota located west of the Missouri River with well over one-half of the land area and between one-quarter and one-third of the population of the state . The contrast between the two regions is striking . While East River is predominantly a corn- and wheat-growing region , with large numbers of pigs and poultry operations , West River is predominantly ranching with some dryland farming . Population has decreased as family farms declined due to the harsh conditions and industrialization of agriculture . Other than aggregates , all mining in South Dakota ( including gold and other precious metals , industrial minerals , iron ore , and coal ) is located in West River , which includes the Black Hills . Both areas were occupied for thousands of years by varying cultures of indigenous peoples . The historical Great Plains tribes , especially the Lakota or Sioux groups , held most of the territory west of the river . Moreover , the Badlands are located here , a vast expanse of rugged , unusable land designated a national park in 1939 .",

The park is South Dakota 's largest and first state park , named after Lt . Colonel George Armstrong Custer .

The park began to grow rapidly in the 1920s and gained new land . During the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps built miles of roads , laid out parks and campgrounds , and built three dams that set up a future of water recreation at the park . In 1964 an additional 22,900 acres ( 93 km2 ) were added to the park . The park covers an area of over 71,000 acres ( 287 km2 ) of hilly terrain and is home to many wild animals .",

  "/wiki/Black_Hills": "The Black Hills ( Lakota : \u021ee S\u00e1pa ; Cheyenne : Mo\u02bc\u022fhta-vo\u02bchon\u00e1aeva ; Hidatsa : awaxaawi shiibisha ) are a small and isolated mountain range rising from the Great Plains of North America in western South Dakota and extending into Wyoming , United States . Black Elk Peak ( formerly known as Harney Peak ) , which rises to 7,244 feet ( 2,208 m ) , is the range 's highest summit . The Black Hills encompass the Black Hills National Forest . The name Black Hills is a translation of the Lakota Pah\u00e1 S\u00e1pa . The hills were so-called because of their dark appearance from a distance , as they were covered in trees . Native Americans have a long history in the Black Hills . After conquering the Cheyenne in 1776 , the Lakota took the territory of the Black Hills , which became central to their culture . In 1868 , the U.S. government signed the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868 , establishing the Great Sioux Reservation west of the Missouri River , and exempting the Black Hills from all white settlement forever . However , when settlers discovered gold there in 1874 , as a result of George Armstrong Custer 's Black Hills Expedition , miners swept into the area in a gold rush . The US government took back the Black Hills and in 1889 reassigned the Lakota , against their wishes , to five smaller reservations in western South Dakota , selling off 9 million acres of their former land . Unlike most of South Dakota , the Black Hills were settled by European Americans primarily from population centers to the west and south of the region , as miners flocked there from earlier gold boom locations in Colorado and Montana . As the economy of the Black Hills has shifted from natural resources ( mining and timber ) since the late 20th century , the hospitality and tourism industries have grown to take its place .",

Much of the refuge has a series of low dikes that help to maintain some areas in a prolonged wetland state , increasing wildlife habitat , especially for migratory bird species . The refuge borders the Nebraska Sandhills , which are a source of water runoff into the early summer . Since the late 1950s , 281 species of birds have been recorded at the refuge . During the spring and fall migratory periods , as many as 29,000 ducks and 37,000 geese have been observed . About 80 and 100 trumpeter swans spend the winter at the refuge each year .
