However , the Republicans lost five seats to the Democrats , but retained a narrow majority in the House . A wave of Republican discontent with Speaker Newt Gingrich prompted him to resign shortly after the election ; he was replaced by Congressman Dennis Hastert of Illinois . The campaign was marked by Republican attacks on the morality of President Bill Clinton , with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr having released his report on the Lewinsky scandal and House leaders having initiated an inquiry into whether impeachable offenses had occurred . However , exit polls indicated that most voters opposed impeaching Clinton , and predictions of high Republican or low Democratic turnout due to the scandal failed to materialize . Some speculate that the losses reflected a backlash against the Republicans for attacking the popular President Clinton . With the Republicans having lost 4 House seats and failing to gain any seats in the Senate , it was the first time since 1934 that the non-presidential party failed to gain congressional seats in a mid-term election .
