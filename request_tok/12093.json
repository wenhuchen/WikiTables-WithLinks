In the churches that observe it , the Assumption is a major feast day , commonly celebrated on 15 August . In many countries , the feast is also marked as a Holy Day of Obligation in the Roman Catholic Church . The Catholic Church teaches as dogma that the Virgin Mary having completed the course of her earthly life , was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory . This doctrine was dogmatically defined by Pope Pius XII on 1 November 1950 , in the apostolic constitution Munificentissimus Deus by exercising papal infallibility . While the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church believe in the Dormition of the Mother of God ( Dormition of the Theotokos or the Falling Asleep of the Mother of God ) , whether Mary had a physical death has not been dogmatically defined . In Munificentissimus Deus ( item 39 ) Pope Pius XII pointed to the Book of Genesis ( 3:15 ) as scriptural support for the dogma in terms of Mary 's victory over sin and death through her intimate association with the new Adam ( Christ ) as also reflected in 1 Corinthians 15:54 : then shall come to pass the saying that is written , Death is swallowed up in victory . The New Testament contains no explicit narrative about the death or Dormition , nor of the Assumption of Mary , but several scriptural passages have been theologically interpreted to describe the ultimate fate in this and the afterworld of the Mother of Jesus ( see below ) .

  "/wiki/Immaculate_Conception": "In Roman Catholic Christian theology , the Immaculate Conception is the conception of the Virgin Mary free from original sin by virtue of the merits of her son Jesus . The Catholic Church teaches that God acted upon Mary in the first moment of her conception , keeping her immaculate . Other Christian denominations have a range of views on the matter . The Immaculate Conception is commonly confused with the virgin birth of Jesus , the latter saying that Jesus was conceived and born by his mother Mary without a human father . While many Christians believe in the virgin birth of Jesus , it is principally Roman Catholics who believe in the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception . Although the belief that Mary was sinless , or conceived without original sin , has been widely held since Late Antiquity , the doctrine was not dogmatically defined in the Catholic Church until 1854 when Pope Pius IX , declared ex cathedra , i.e. , using papal infallibility , in his papal bull Ineffabilis Deus , the Immaculate Conception to be doctrine . The Catholic Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception on December 8 ; in many Catholic countries , it is a holy day of obligation or patronal feast , and in some a national public holiday .",

  "/wiki/Wiener_Neustadt_Cathedral": "Wiener Neustadt Cathedral , or the Cathedral of the Assumption of Mary and St. Rupert ( German : Wiener Neust\u00e4dter Dom ; Dom Mari\u00e4 Himmelfahrt und Sankt Rupert ) , is a Catholic church located in Wiener Neustadt , Austria . Now a parish church , it was previously the cathedral of the diocese of Wiener Neustadt between 1468 and 1785 , the year of the suppression of the diocese . The location and orientation of the building were selected and designed in the Middle Ages . The nave faces north and west in alignment with sunrise on the day of Pentecost on May 24 , 1192 , when Duke Leopold V was invested by Emperor Henry VI . In 1207 the construction of the Romanesque church began . It was consecrated in 1279 . From 1588 to 1630 , Melchor Klesl was the administrator of the diocese , and built the first Baroque pulpit . The Baroque altar with the altarpiece of the Assumption of Mary by Giandomenico Cignaroli was fitted in 1776 . In 1886 the westwork and its towers were demolished because of damage from an earthquake ; they were later rebuilt under the direction of the Viennese architect Richard Jordan . On March 6 , 2012 , a fire affected the cathedral , which was closed for six months to allow for repairs .",
  "/wiki/Assumption_of_Mary": "The Assumption of Mary into Heaven ( often shortened to the Assumption ) is , according to the beliefs of the Catholic Church , Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy , the bodily taking up of the Virgin Mary into Heaven at the end of her earthly life . In the churches that observe it , the Assumption is a major feast day , commonly celebrated on 15 August . In many countries , the feast is also marked as a Holy Day of Obligation in the Roman Catholic Church . The Catholic Church teaches as dogma that the Virgin Mary having completed the course of her earthly life , was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory . This doctrine was dogmatically defined by Pope Pius XII on 1 November 1950 , in the apostolic constitution Munificentissimus Deus by exercising papal infallibility . While the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church believe in the Dormition of the Mother of God ( Dormition of the Theotokos or the Falling Asleep of the Mother of God ) , whether Mary had a physical death has not been dogmatically defined . In Munificentissimus Deus ( item 39 ) Pope Pius XII pointed to the Book of Genesis ( 3:15 ) as scriptural support for the dogma in terms of Mary 's victory over sin and death through her intimate association with the new Adam ( Christ ) as also reflected in 1 Corinthians 15:54 : then shall come to pass the saying that is written , Death is swallowed up in victory . The New Testament contains no explicit narrative about the death or Dormition , nor of the Assumption of Mary , but several scriptural passages have been theologically interpreted to describe the ultimate fate in this and the afterworld of the Mother of Jesus ( see below ) . Various apocryphal documents do contain narrations of the event .",
  "/wiki/Diocese_of_Wiener_Neustadt": "The former Roman Catholic Diocese of Wiener Neustadt in Lower Austria existed from 1469 to 1785 . In 1990 , it was re-established as a titular see which is held by the bishop for the Military Services in Austria .",
  "/wiki/Titular_bishopric": "A titular see in various churches is an episcopal see of a former diocese that no longer functions , sometimes called a dead diocese . The ordinary or hierarch of such a see may be styled a titular metropolitan ( highest rank ) , titular archbishop ( intermediary rank ) or titular bishop ( lowest rank ) , which normally goes by the status conferred on the titular see . The term is used to signify a diocese that no longer functionally exists , often because the diocese once flourished but the territory was conquered by Muslims or no longer functions because of a schism . The Greek-Turkish population exchange of 1923 also contributed to titular bishoprics . The see of Maximianoupolis along with the town that shared its name was destroyed by the Bulgarians under Emperor Kaloyan in 1207 ; the town and the see were under the control of the Latin Empire , which took Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade in 1204 . Parthenia , in north Africa , was abandoned and swallowed by desert sand ."
