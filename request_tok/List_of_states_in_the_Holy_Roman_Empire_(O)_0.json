The landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg consisted of two parts , the district of Homburg on the right side of the Rhine , and the district of Meisenheim , added in 1815 , on the left side of the same river . In 1866 , Hesse-Homburg was inherited by the grand-duke of Hesse-Darmstadt , while Meisenheim fell to Prussia . Later that same year , these territories were taken from Hesse-Darmstadt again , and the former landgraviate was combined with the Electorate of Hesse-Kassel , duchy of Nassau , and the free city of Frankfurt to form the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau .

With an area of 70,550.19 square kilometres ( 27,200 sq mi ) , Bavaria is the largest German state by land area comprising roughly a fifth of the total land area of Germany . With 13 million inhabitants , it is Germany 's second-most-populous state after North Rhine-Westphalia . Bavaria 's main cities are Munich ( its capital and largest city and also the third largest city in Germany ) , Nuremberg and Augsburg . The history of Bavaria includes its earliest settlement by Iron Age Celtic tribes , followed by the conquests of the Roman Empire in the 1st century BC , when the territory was incorporated into the provinces of Raetia and Noricum . It became a stem duchy in the 6th century AD following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire . It was later incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire , became an independent kingdom , joined the Prussian-led German Empire in 1871 while retaining its title of kingdom , and finally became a state of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949 . The Duchy of Bavaria dates back to the year 555 . In the 17th century AD , the Duke of Bavaria became a Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire .

It existed between 1806 and 1918 . It came into existence in the 12th century as the Margraviate of Baden and subsequently split into different lines , which were unified in 1771 . It then became the much-enlarged Grand Duchy of Baden through the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1803-1806 and was a sovereign country until it joined the German Empire in 1871 , remaining a Grand Duchy until 1918 when it became part of the Weimar Republic as the Republic of Baden . Baden was bordered to the north by the Kingdom of Bavaria and the Grand Duchy of Hessen-Darmstadt ; to the west , along most of its length , by the river Rhine , which separated Baden from the Bavarian Rhenish Palatinate and Alsace in modern France ; to the south by Switzerland ; and to the east by the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg , the Principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen and Bavaria . After World War II , the French military government in 1945 created the state of Baden ( originally known as South Baden ) out of the southern half of the former Baden , with Freiburg as its capital . This portion of the former Baden was declared in its 1947 constitution to be the true successor of the old Baden . The northern half of the old Baden was combined with northern W\u00fcrttemberg , becoming part of the American military zone , and formed the state of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden . Both Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden became states of West Germany upon its formation in 1949 .

Its rulers served as prince-electors ( Kurf\u00fcrsten ) from time immemorial , were noted as such in a papal letter of 1261 , and were confirmed as electors by the Golden Bull of 1356 . The fragmented territory stretched from the left bank of the Upper Rhine , from the Hunsr\u00fcck mountain range in what is today the Palatinate region in the German federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate and the adjacent parts of the French regions of Alsace and Lorraine ( bailiwick of Seltz from 1418 to 1766 ) to the opposite territory on the east bank of the Rhine in present-day Hesse and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg up to the Odenwald range and the southern Kraichgau region , containing the capital cities of Heidelberg and Mannheim . The Counts Palatine of the Rhine held the office of imperial vicars in the territories under Frankish law ( in Franconia , Swabia and the Rhineland ) and ranked among the most significant secular Princes of the Holy Roman Empire . In 1541 elector Otto Henry converted to Lutheranism . Their climax and decline is marked by the rule of Elector Palatine Frederick V , whose coronation as King of Bohemia in 1619 sparked the Thirty Years ' War . After the 1648 Peace of Westphalia , the ravaged lands were further afflicted by the Reunion campaigns launched by King Louis XIV of France , culminating in the Nine Years ' War ( 1688-97 ) .

The throne of the Holy Roman Empire was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs from 1438 until their extinction in the male line in 1740 . The house also produced kings of Bohemia , Hungary , Croatia , Galicia , Portugal and Spain with their respective colonies , as well as rulers of several principalities in the Netherlands and Italy . From the 16th century , following the reign of Charles V , the dynasty was split between its Austrian and Spanish branches . Although they ruled distinct territories , they nevertheless maintained close relations and frequently intermarried . The House takes its name from Habsburg Castle , a fortress built in the 1020s in present-day Switzerland , in the canton of Aargau , by Count Radbot of Klettgau , who named his fortress Habsburg . His grandson Otto II was the first to take the fortress name as his own , adding Count of Habsburg to his title . The House of Habsburg gathered dynastic momentum through the 11th , 12th , and 13th centuries . In 1273 , Count Radbot 's seventh generation descendant Rudolph of Habsburg became Roman-German King . He moved the family 's power base to the Duchy of Austria , which the Habsburgs ruled until 1918 . A series of dynastic marriages enabled the family to vastly expand its domains to include Burgundy , Spain and its colonial empire , Bohemia , Hungary , and other territories .

  "/wiki/Old_Swiss_Confederacy": "The Old Swiss Confederacy ( Modern German : Alte Eidgenossenschaft ; historically Eidgenossenschaft , after the Reformation also R\u00e9publique des Suisses , Res publica Helvetiorum Republic of the Swiss ) was a loose confederation of independent small states ( cantons , German Orte or St\u00e4nde ) within the Holy Roman Empire . It is the precursor of the modern state of Switzerland . It formed during the 14th century , from a nucleus in what is now Central Switzerland , expanding to include the cities of Z\u00fcrich and Berne by the middle of the century . This formed a rare union of rural and urban communes , all of which enjoyed imperial immediacy in the Holy Roman Empire . This confederation of eight cantons ( Acht Orte ) was politically and militarily successful for more than a century , culminating in the Burgundy Wars of the 1470s which established it as a power in the complicated political landscape dominated by France and the Habsburgs . Its success resulted in the addition of more confederates , increasing the number of cantons to thirteen ( Dreizehn Orte ) by 1513 . The confederacy pledged neutrality in 1647 ( under the threat of the Thirty Years ' War ) , although many Swiss served privately as mercenaries in the Italian Wars and during the Early Modern period . After the Swabian War of 1499 the confederacy was a de facto independent state throughout the early modern period , although still nominally part of the Holy Roman Empire until 1648 when the Treaty of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years ' War . The Swiss Reformation divided the confederates into Reformed and Catholic parties , resulting in internal conflict from the 16th to the 18th centuries ; as a result , the federal diet ( Tagsatzung ) was often paralysed by hostility between the factions . The Swiss Confederacy fell to invasion by the French Revolutionary Army in 1798 , after which it became the short-lived Helvetic Republic .",
