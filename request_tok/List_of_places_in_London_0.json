  "/wiki/London_borough": "The London boroughs are the 32 local authority districts that make up Greater London ; each is governed by a London borough council . The London boroughs were all created at the same time as Greater London on 1 April 1965 by the London Government Act 1963 and are a type of local government district . Twelve were designated as Inner London boroughs and twenty as Outer London boroughs . The London boroughs have populations of around 150,000 to 300,000 . Inner London boroughs tend to be smaller , in both population and area , and more densely populated than Outer London boroughs . The London boroughs were created by combining groups of former local government units . A review undertaken between 1987 and 1992 led to a number of relatively small alterations in borough boundaries . London borough councils provide the majority of local government services ( schools , waste management , social services , libraries ) , in contrast to the strategic Greater London Authority , which has limited authority over all of Greater London . The councils were first elected in 1964 and acted as shadow authorities until 1 April 1965 . Each borough is divided into electoral wards , subject to periodic review , for the purpose of electing councillors . Council elections take place every four years , with the most recent elections in 2018 and the next elections due in 2022 . The political make-up of London borough councils is dominated by the Conservative , Labour and Liberal Democrat parties .",
  "/wiki/Inner_London": "Inner London is the name for the group of London boroughs which form the interior part of Greater London and are surrounded by Outer London . With its origins in the Bills of mortality , it became fixed as an area for statistics in 1847 and was used as an area of local government from 1855 to 1965 principally as the County of London or earlier as the Metropolitan Board of Works Area ( metropolis ) . It now has two common definitions . The first is the statutory definition delineated in the London Government Act 1963 , coming into force on 1 April 1965 , comprising twelve Inner London boroughs and almost identical to the County of London that was abolished at the same time . The second is the current definition used by the Office for National Statistics comprising eleven of the statutory Inner London boroughs and two of the statutory Outer London boroughs , and the City of London . Inner London is smaller than Outer London both in terms of population and area , but the density of population is more than double that of Outer London . Inner London is officially the wealthiest area in Europe with the most expensive street in Europe : GDP per capita is more than \u20ac80,000 while the UK GDP per capita is around \u20ac27,000 . Many of the world 's wealthiest people live in Inner London , but there is also widespread poverty . Central London is located at the core of Inner London .
