Under United States copyright law , all software is copyright protected , in both source code and object code forms , unless that software was developed by the United States Government , in which case it can not be copyrighted . Authors of copyrighted software can donate their software to the public domain , in which case it is also not covered by copyright and , as a result , can not be licensed . A typical software license grants the licensee , typically an end-user , permission to use one or more copies of software in ways where such a use would otherwise potentially constitute copyright infringement of the software owner 's exclusive rights under copyright .",

  "/wiki/MIT_License": "The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) in the late 1980s . As a permissive license , it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has , therefore , reasonable license compatibility . It is compatible because it can be re-licensed under other licenses . The MIT license is compatible with many copyleft licenses , such as the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) ; MIT licensed software can be re-licensed as GPL software , and integrated with other GPL software , but not the other way around . The MIT license also permits reuse within proprietary software , provided that either all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice , or the software is re-licensed to remove this requirement . MIT-licensed software can also be re-licensed as proprietary software , which distinguishes it from copyleft software licenses . As of 2015 [ update ] , MIT was the most popular software license on GitHub , ahead of any GPL variant and other free and open-source software ( FOSS ) licenses . Notable projects that use the MIT License include the X Window System , Ruby on Rails , and Node.js .",

  "/wiki/BSD_licenses": "BSD licenses are a family of permissive free software licenses , imposing minimal restrictions on the use and distribution of covered software . This is in contrast to copyleft licenses , which have share-alike requirements . The original BSD license was used for its namesake , the Berkeley Software Distribution ( BSD ) , a Unix-like operating system . The original version has since been revised , and its descendants are referred to as modified BSD licenses . BSD is both a license and a class of license ( generally referred to as BSD-like ) . The modified BSD license ( in wide use today ) is very similar to the license originally used for the BSD version of Unix . The BSD license is a simple license that merely requires that all code retain the BSD license notice if redistributed in source code format , or reproduce the notice if redistributed in binary format . The BSD license ( unlike some other licenses ) does not require that source code be distributed at all .",

  "/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License": "The GNU Lesser General Public License ( LGPL ) is a free-software license published by the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) . The license allows developers and companies to use and integrate a software component released under the LGPL into their own ( even proprietary ) software without being required by the terms of a strong copyleft license to release the source code of their own components . However , any developer who modifies an LGPL-covered component is required to make their modified version available under the same LGPL license . For proprietary software , code under the LGPL is usually used in the form of a shared library , so that there is a clear separation between the proprietary and LGPL components . The LGPL is primarily used for software libraries , although it is also used by some stand-alone applications . The LGPL was developed as a compromise between the strong copyleft of the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) and more permissive licenses such as the BSD licenses and the MIT License . The word Lesser in the title shows that the LGPL does not guarantee the end user 's complete freedom in the use of software ; it only guarantees the freedom of modification for components licensed under the LGPL , but not for any proprietary components .",

It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation ( DSF ) , an independent organization established as a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) non-profit . Django 's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex , database-driven websites . The framework emphasizes reusability and pluggability of components , less code , low coupling , rapid development , and the principle of do n't repeat yourself . Python is used throughout , even for settings files and data models . Django also provides an optional administrative create , read , update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models . Some well-known sites that use Django include the Public Broadcasting Service , Instagram , Mozilla , The Washington Times , Disqus , Bitbucket , and Nextdoor . It was used on Pinterest , but later the site moved to a framework built over Flask .",

It has no database abstraction layer , form validation , or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions . However , Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself . Extensions exist for object-relational mappers , form validation , upload handling , various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools . Extensions are updated far more frequently than the core Flask program . Applications that use the Flask framework include Pinterest and LinkedIn .",

The primary motive behind Grok is to make the Zope Toolkit technology more accessible and easier to use for newcomers and , at the same time , speed up application development , in accordance with the agile programming paradigm . To achieve this , Grok uses convention-over-configuration instead of using an explicit XML based configuration language ( ZCML ) as Zope Toolkit and BlueBream do . Grok uses Python code for component configuration , and has many implicit defaults and conventions . Grok is similar in feel to other Python Web frameworks such as TurboGears , Pylons and Django .",
