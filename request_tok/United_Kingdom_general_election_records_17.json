The party currently has 11 Members of Parliament in the House of Commons , 94 members of the House of Lords , five Members of the Scottish Parliament and one member in each of the Welsh Assembly and the London Assembly . It was in a coalition government with the Conservative Party from 2010-15 . In 1981 , an electoral alliance was established between the Liberal Party , a group which was the direct descendant of the 18th-century Whigs , and the Social Democratic Party ( SDP ) , a splinter group from the Labour Party . In 1988 , the parties merged as the Social and Liberal Democrats , adopting their present name over a year later . Under the leadership of Paddy Ashdown and later Charles Kennedy , the party grew during the 1990s and 2000s , focusing its campaigns on specific seats and becoming the third-largest party in the House of Commons . Under the leadership of Nick Clegg , the Liberal Democrats were junior partners in David Cameron 's Conservative-led coalition government in which Clegg served as Deputy Prime Minister . Although it allowed them to implement some of their policies , the coalition damaged the Liberal Democrats ' electoral prospects and it suffered heavy losses at the 2015 general election . Since then , under the leaderships of Tim Farron , Sir Vince Cable and Jo Swinson , it has refocused itself as a party opposing Brexit . Positioned in the centre ground of British politics , the Liberal Democrats ideologically draw upon both liberalism and social democracy . Different factions have dominated the party at different points in its history , each with its own ideological bent , some leaning towards the centre-left and others the centre-right . The party calls for constitutional reform , including a transition from the first-past-the-post voting system to proportional representation .",

  "/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)": "The Liberal Party was one of the two major parties in the United Kingdom with the opposing Conservative Party in the 19th and early 20th centuries . The party arose from an alliance of Whigs and free trade-supporting Peelites and the reformist Radicals in the 1850s . By the end of the 19th century , it had formed four governments under William Gladstone . Despite being divided over the issue of Irish Home Rule , the party returned to government in 1905 and then won a landslide victory in the following year 's general election . Under prime ministers Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman ( 1905-1908 ) and H. H. Asquith ( 1908-1916 ) , the Liberal Party passed the welfare reforms that created a basic British welfare state .

In 1950 it was expanded to include the far south of the county . It was a marginal constituency for most of its existence . The area had an ever-expanding population after 1945 as prosperous suburbs of Derby were built outside the city boundaries . Lord George-Brown , who represented the seat at the time , wrote in 1971 after his defeat in the 1970 general election that The electorate had increased by over 10,000 since 1966 , mainly from the growth of middle-class housing estates , so that most of the new electors could be expected to vote Tory . Since my majority in 1966 was 4,274 , an influx of 10,000 new voters , mainly Tory , obviously imperilled the seat . A Boundary Commission report issued in 1969 had recommended changes which would have removed the extra voters , but the Labour government of the time had delayed implementation of the report .",
