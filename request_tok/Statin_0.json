  "/wiki/Atorvastatin": "Atorvastatin , sold under the trade name Lipitor among others , is a statin medication used to prevent cardiovascular disease in those at high risk and treat abnormal lipid levels . For the prevention of cardiovascular disease , statins are a first-line treatment . It is taken by mouth . Common side effects include joint pain , diarrhea , heartburn , nausea , and muscle pains . Serious side effects may include rhabdomyolysis , liver problems , and diabetes . Use during pregnancy may harm the baby . Like all statins , atorvastatin works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase , an enzyme found in the liver that plays a role in producing cholesterol . Atorvastatin was patented in 1986 , and approved for medical use in the United States in 1996 . It is available as a generic medication . In the United States , the wholesale cost per month is about US $ 3.80 as of 2018 . In the United Kingdom , it costs the NHS about \u00a30.70 per month as of 2018 . In 2016 , it was the third most prescribed medication in the United States , with more than 96 million prescriptions .",
  "/wiki/CYP3A4": "Cytochrome P450 3A4 ( abbreviated CYP3A4 ) ( EC 1.14.13.97 ) is an important enzyme in the body , mainly found in the liver and in the intestine . It oxidizes small foreign organic molecules ( xenobiotics ) , such as toxins or drugs , so that they can be removed from the body . While many drugs are deactivated by CYP3A4 , there are also some drugs which are activated by the enzyme . Some substances , such as grapefruit juice and some drugs , interfere with the action of CYP3A4 . These substances will therefore either amplify or weaken the action of those drugs that are modified by CYP3A4 . CYP3A4 is a member of the cytochrome P450 family of oxidizing enzymes . Several other members of this family are also involved in drug metabolism , but CYP3A4 is the most common and the most versatile one . Like all members of this family , it is a hemoprotein , i.e . a protein containing a heme group with an iron atom . In humans , the CYP3A4 protein is encoded by the CYP3A4 gene . This gene is part of a cluster of cytochrome P450 genes on chromosome 7q22.1 .",
  "/wiki/Cerivastatin": "Cerivastatin ( INN , brand names : Baycol , Lipobay ) is a synthetic member of the class of statins used to lower cholesterol and prevent cardiovascular disease . It was marketed by the pharmaceutical company Bayer A.G. in the late 1990s , competing with Pfizer 's highly successful atorvastatin ( Lipitor ) . Cerivastatin was voluntarily withdrawn from the market worldwide in 2001 , due to reports of fatal rhabdomyolysis . During postmarketing surveillance , 52 deaths were reported in patients using cerivastatin , mainly from rhabdomyolysis and its resultant kidney failure . Risks were higher in patients using fibrates , mainly gemfibrozil ( Lopid ) , and in patients using the highest ( 0.8 mg/day ) dose of cerivastatin . Bayer A.G. added a contraindication for the concomitant use of cerivastatin and gemfibrozil to the package 18 months after the drug interaction was found . The frequency of deadly cases of rhabdomyolysis with cerivastatin was 16 to 80 times higher than with other statins . Another 385 nonfatal cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported . This put the risk of this ( rare ) complication at 5-10 times that of the other statins . Cerivastatin also induced myopathy in a dose-dependent manner when administered as monotherapy , but that was revealed only after Bayer was sued and unpublished company documents were opened .",
  "/wiki/Rhabdomyolysis": "Rhabdomyolysis is a condition in which damaged skeletal muscle breaks down rapidly . Symptoms may include muscle pains , weakness , vomiting , and confusion . There may be tea-colored urine or an irregular heartbeat . Some of the muscle breakdown products , such as the protein myoglobin , are harmful to the kidneys and may lead to kidney failure . The muscle damage is most often the result of a crush injury , strenuous exercise , medications , or drug abuse . Other causes include infections , electrical injury , heat stroke , prolonged immobilization , lack of blood flow to a limb , or snake bites . Some people have inherited muscle conditions that increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis . The diagnosis is supported by a urine test strip which is positive for blood but the urine contains no red blood cells when examined with a microscope . Blood tests show a creatine kinase greater than 1,000 U/L , with severe disease being above 5,000 U/L . The mainstay of treatment is large quantities of intravenous fluids . Other treatments may include dialysis or hemofiltration in more severe cases . Once urine output is established sodium bicarbonate and mannitol are commonly used but they are poorly supported by the evidence .",

Red yeast rice is what is referred to as a koji in Japanese , meaning grain or bean overgrown with a mold culture , a food preparation tradition going back to ca . 300 BC . In both the scientific and popular literature in English that draws principally on Japanese traditional use , red yeast rice is most often referred to as red rice koji . English language articles favoring Chinese literature sources prefer the translation red yeast rice . In addition to its culinary use , red yeast rice is also used in Chinese herbology and Traditional Chinese medicine . Its use has been documented as far back as the Tang Dynasty in China in 800 AD . Red yeast rice is described in the Chinese pharmacopoeia Ben Cao Gang Mu by Li Shizhen . Recommendations were to take it internally to invigorate the body , aid in digestion , and revitalize the blood . A modern-era use as a dietary supplement developed in the late 1970s after researchers were isolating lovastatin from Aspergillus and monacolins from Monascus , respectively , the latter being the same fungus used to make red yeast rice . Chemical analysis soon showed that lovastatin and monacolin K were identical .",
  "/wiki/Mevastatin": "Mevastatin ( compactin , ML-236B ) is a hypolipidemic agent that belongs to the statins class .

Mevastatin might be considered the first statin drug ; clinical trials on mevastatin were performed in the late 1970s in Japan , but it was never marketed . The first statin drug available to the general public was lovastatin . Mevastatin has since been derivatized to the compound pravastatin , which is a pharmaceutical used in the lowering of cholesterol and preventing cardiovascular disease . In vitro , it has antiproliferative properties . A British group isolated the same compound from Penicillium brevicompactum , named it compactin , and published their results in 1976 .
