  "/wiki/Lake_Powell": "Lake Powell is a reservoir on the Colorado River , straddling the border between Utah and Arizona , United States . Most of Lake Powell , along with Rainbow Bridge National Monument , is located in Utah . It is a major vacation spot that around two million people visit every year . It is the second largest man-made reservoir by maximum water capacity in the United States behind Lake Mead , storing 24,322,000 acre feet ( 3.0001\u00d71010 m3 ) of water when full . However , due to high water withdrawals for human and agricultural consumption , and because of subsequent droughts in the area , Lake Mead has fallen below Lake Powell in size several times during the 21st century in terms of volume of water , depth and surface area . Lake Powell was created by the flooding of Glen Canyon by the Glen Canyon Dam , which also led to the creation of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area , a popular summer destination . The reservoir is named for explorer John Wesley Powell , a one-armed American Civil War veteran who explored the river via three wooden boats in 1869 . In 1972 , Glen Canyon National Recreation Area was established . It is public land managed by the National Park Service , and available to the public for recreational purposes . It lies in parts of Garfield , Kane , and San Juan counties in southern Utah , and Coconino County in northern Arizona . The northern limits of the lake extend at least as far as the Hite Crossing Bridge . Lake Powell is a water storage facility for the Upper Basin states of the Colorado River Compact ( Colorado , Utah , Wyoming and New Mexico ) .",

  "/wiki/Colorado_River": "The Colorado River is one of the principal rivers ( along with the Rio Grande ) in the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico . The 1,450-mile-long ( 2,330 km ) river drains an expansive , arid watershed that encompasses parts of seven U.S. states and two Mexican states . Starting in the central Rocky Mountains of Colorado , the river flows generally southwest across the Colorado Plateau and through the Grand Canyon before reaching Lake Mead on the Arizona-Nevada border , where it turns south toward the international border . After entering Mexico , the Colorado approaches the mostly dry Colorado River Delta at the tip of the Gulf of California between Baja California and Sonora . Known for its dramatic canyons , whitewater rapids , and eleven U.S. National Parks , the Colorado River and its tributaries are a vital source of water for 40 million people . The river and its tributaries are controlled by an extensive system of dams , reservoirs , and aqueducts , which in most years divert its entire flow for agricultural irrigation and domestic water supply . Its large flow and steep gradient are used for generating hydroelectric power , and its major dams regulate peaking power demands in much of the Intermountain West . Intensive water consumption has dried up the lower 100 miles ( 160 km ) of the river , which has rarely reached the sea since the 1960s . Beginning with small bands of nomadic hunter-gatherers , Native Americans have inhabited the Colorado River basin for at least 8,000 years . Between 2,000 and 1,000 years ago , the watershed was home to large agricultural civilizations - considered some of the most sophisticated indigenous North American cultures - which eventually declined due to a combination of severe drought and poor land use practices . Most native peoples that inhabit the region today are descended from other groups that settled there beginning about 1,000 years ago . Europeans first entered the Colorado Basin in the 16th century , when explorers from Spain began mapping and claiming the area , which became part of Mexico upon its independence in 1821 .",

  "/wiki/La_Paz_County,_Arizona": "La Paz County is a county in the western part of the U.S. state of Arizona . As of the 2010 census , its population was 20,489 , making it the second-least populous county in Arizona . The county seat is Parker . The name of the county is the Spanish word for the peace , and is taken from the early settlement ( now ghost town ) of La Paz along the Colorado River . La Paz County was established in 1983 after voters approved separating the northern portion of Yuma County , making it the only county to be established after Arizona became a state in 1912 , and currently the second youngest county in the United States ( behind the consolidated city-county of Broomfield , Colorado , which was established in 2001 ) . The county did not have a large enough tax base to begin supporting a separate county government immediately and had to rely on state money at first . As a result , Arizona laws were changed to make splitting other existing counties much more difficult . Under the revised Arizona laws , a county shall not be formed or divided by county initiative unless each proposed county would have all of the following characteristics : ( 1 ) at least three-fourths of one percent of the total state assessed valuation and at least the statewide per capita assessed valuation ; ( 2 ) a population of at least three-fourths of one percent of the total state population according to the most recent United States decennial census ; ( 3 ) at least one hundred square miles of privately owned land ; ( 4 ) common boundaries with either ( a ) at least three other existing or proposed counties ; or ( b ) at least two other existing or proposed counties and the state boundary . A county formation commission is required to be formed to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed county . A proposal to divide a county must be approved by a majority of the votes cast in each proposed new county . The Colorado River Indian Reservation is located in the western portion of the county . Part of the reservation extends westward into San Bernardino and Riverside counties in California .",
