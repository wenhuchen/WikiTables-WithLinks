  "/wiki/News_of_the_World": "The News of the World was a weekly national red top tabloid newspaper published every Sunday in the United Kingdom from 1843 to 2011 . It was at one time the world 's highest-selling English-language newspaper , and at closure still had one of the highest English-language circulations . It was originally established as a broadsheet by John Browne Bell , who identified crime , sensation and vice as the themes that would sell most copies . The Bells sold to Henry Lascelles Carr in 1891 ; in 1969 it was bought from the Carrs by Rupert Murdoch 's media firm News Limited . Reorganised into News International , a subsidiary of News Corporation , the newspaper was transformed into a tabloid in 1984 and became the Sunday sister paper of The Sun . The News of the World concentrated in particular on celebrity scoops , gossip and populist news . Its somewhat prurient focus on sex scandals gained it the nickname News of the Screws . In its last decade it had a reputation for exposing celebrities ' drug use , sexual peccadilloes , or criminal acts , by using insiders and journalists in disguise to provide video or photographic evidence , and covert phone hacking in ongoing police investigations . Sales averaged 2,812,005 copies per week in October 2010 . From 2006 , allegations of phone hacking began to engulf the newspaper . These culminated in the revelation on 4 July 2011 that , nearly a decade earlier , a private investigator hired by the newspaper had intercepted the voicemail of missing British teenager Milly Dowler , who was later found murdered . Amid a public backlash and the withdrawal of advertising , News International announced the closure of the newspaper on 7 July 2011 .",

Their lyrics , often embellished with spiritual imagery , focus on personal and sociopolitical themes . Popular for their live performances , the group have staged several ambitious and elaborate tours over their career . The band formed as teenagers while attending Mount Temple Comprehensive School , when they had limited musical proficiency .
