  "/wiki/St_Peulan's_Church,_Llanbeulan": "St Peulan 's Church , Llanbeulan is a redundant Anglican church in Llanbeulan , in Anglesey , north Wales . The nave , which is the oldest part of the building , dates from the 12th century , with a chancel and side chapel added in the 14th century . The church has a font of early date , possibly from the first half of the 11th century : one historian has said that it would initially have been used as an altar and that as an altar of the pre-Norman period it is a unique survivor in Wales and , indeed , in Britain . The redundant church has been in the care of the charity , the Friends of Friendless Churches since 2005 . It is a Grade II* listed building , a designation given to particularly important buildings of more than special interest , because it is a medieval church of typical Anglesey type that has retained its simple character despite 19th-century alterations .",

It forms the principal area ( as Isle of Anglesey ) and historic county of that name , which includes Holy Island to the west and some islets and skerries . Anglesey island , at 260 square miles ( 673 km2 ) , is by far the largest island in Wales , seventh largest in the British Isles , largest in the Irish Sea and second most populous after the Isle of Man . The local-government area of Isle of Anglesey County Council measures 276 square miles ( 715 km2 ) , , with a 2011 census population of 69,751 , of whom 13,659 live on Holy Island . The Menai Strait between Anglesey and mainland Wales is spanned by the Menai Suspension Bridge , designed by Thomas Telford in 1826 , and the Britannia Bridge , built in 1850 and replaced in 1980 . The largest town is Holyhead , where the port handles over 2 million passengers a year with Ireland . The next largest is Llangefni , seat of the county council . From 1974 to 1996 Anglesey was run as part of Gwynedd . Most Anglesey inhabitants are Welsh speakers . The name Ynys M\u00f4n is used for the UK Parliament and National Assembly constituencies .

  "/wiki/Middle_Ages": "In the history of Europe , the Middle Ages ( or medieval period ) lasted from the 5th to the 15th century . It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery . The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history : classical antiquity , the medieval period , and the modern period . The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early , High , and Late Middle Ages . Population decline , counterurbanisation , collapse of centralized authority , invasions , and mass migrations of tribes , which had begun in Late Antiquity , continued in the Early Middle Ages . The large-scale movements of the Migration Period , including various Germanic peoples , formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire . In the 7th century , North Africa and the Middle East - once part of the Byzantine Empire - came under the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate , an Islamic empire , after conquest by Muhammad 's successors . Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures , the break with classical antiquity was not complete . The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire , Rome 's direct continuation , survived in the Eastern Mediterranean and remained a major power . The empire 's law code , the Corpus Juris Civilis or Code of Justinian , was rediscovered in Northern Italy in 1070 and became widely admired later in the Middle Ages . In the West , most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions . Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise pagan Europe continued .",

  "/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England": "The Norman conquest of England ( in Britain , often called the Norman Conquest or the Conquest ) was the 11th-century invasion and occupation of England by an army of Norman , Breton , Flemish , and French soldiers led by the Duke of Normandy , later styled William the Conqueror . William 's claim to the English throne derived from his familial relationship with the childless Anglo-Saxon king Edward the Confessor , who may have encouraged William 's hopes for the throne . Edward died in January 1066 and was succeeded by his brother-in-law Harold Godwinson . The Norwegian king Harald Hardrada invaded northern England in September 1066 and was victorious at the Battle of Fulford , but Godwinson 's army defeated and killed Hardrada at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September . Within days , William landed in southern England . Harold marched south to oppose him , leaving a significant portion of his army in the north . Harold 's army confronted William 's invaders on 14 October at the Battle of Hastings ; William 's force defeated Harold , who was killed in the engagement . Although William 's main rivals were gone , he still faced rebellions over the following years and was not secure on his throne until after 1072 . The lands of the resisting English elite were confiscated ; some of the elite fled into exile . To control his new kingdom , William granted lands to his followers and built castles commanding military strongpoints throughout the land with the Domesday Book , a manuscript record of the Great Survey of much of England and parts of Wales being completed by 1086 . Other effects of the conquest included the court and government , the introduction of the Norman language as the language of the elites , and changes in the composition of the upper classes , as William enfeoffed lands to be held directly from the king . More gradual changes affected the agricultural classes and village life : the main change appears to have been the formal elimination of slavery , which may or may not have been linked to the invasion .",

  "/wiki/Georgian_architecture": "Georgian architecture is the name given in most English-speaking countries to the set of architectural styles current between 1714 and 1830 . It is eponymous for the first four British monarchs of the House of Hanover - George I , George II , George III , and George IV - who reigned in continuous succession from August 1714 to June 1830 . The style was revived in the late 19th century in the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture ; in both it is also called Georgian Revival architecture . In the United States the term Georgian is generally used to describe all buildings from the period , regardless of style ; in Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are architectural in intention , and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period , though that covers a wide range . The Georgian style is highly variable , but marked by symmetry and proportion based on the classical architecture of Greece and Rome , as revived in Renaissance architecture . Ornament is also normally in the classical tradition , but typically restrained , and sometimes almost completely absent on the exterior . The period brought the vocabulary of classical architecture to smaller and more modest buildings than had been the case before , replacing English vernacular architecture ( or becoming the new vernacular style ) for almost all new middle-class homes and public buildings by the end of the period . Georgian architecture is characterized by its proportion and balance ; simple mathematical ratios were used to determine the height of a window in relation to its width or the shape of a room as a double cube . Regularity , as with ashlar ( uniformly cut ) stonework , was strongly approved , imbuing symmetry and adherence to classical rules : the lack of symmetry , where Georgian additions were added to earlier structures remaining visible , was deeply felt as a flaw , at least before John Nash began to introduce it in a variety of styles . Regularity of housefronts along a street was a desirable feature of Georgian town planning . Until the start of the Gothic Revival in the early 19th century , Georgian designs usually lay within the Classical orders of architecture and employed a decorative vocabulary derived from ancient Rome or Greece .",

  "/wiki/Protestant_Reformation": "The Reformation ( alternatively named the Protestant Reformation or the European Reformation ) was a movement within Western Christianity in the 16th-century Europe that posed a religious and political challenge to the Roman Catholic Church and papal authority in particular . Although the Reformation is usually considered to have started with the publication of the Ninety-five Theses by Martin Luther in 1517 , there was no schism between the Catholic Church and the nascent Luther until the 1521 Edict of Worms . The edict condemned Luther and officially banned citizens of the Holy Roman Empire from defending or propagating his ideas . The end of the Reformation era is disputed : it could be considered to end with the enactment of the confessions of faith which began the Age of Orthodoxy . [ definition needed ] Other suggested ending years relate to the Counter-Reformation , the Peace of Westphalia , or that it never ended since there are still Protestants today . [ citation needed ] Movements had been made towards a Reformation prior to Luther , so some Protestants in the tradition of the Radical Reformation prefer to credit the start of the Reformation to reformers such as Arnold of Brescia , Peter Waldo , John Wycliffe , Jan Hus , Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd , and Girolamo Savonarola . [ a ] Due to the reform efforts of Hus and other Bohemian reformers , Utraquist Hussitism was acknowledged by the Council of Basel and was officially tolerated in the Crown of Bohemia , although other movements were still subject to persecution , including the Lollards in England and the Waldensians in France and Italian regions . [ citation needed ] Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences , insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Treasury of Merit had no foundation in the Bible . The Reformation developed further to include a distinction between Law and Gospel , a complete reliance on Scripture as the only source of proper doctrine ( sola scriptura ) and the belief that faith in Jesus is the only way to receive God 's pardon for sin ( sola fide ) rather than good works . Although this is generally considered a Protestant belief , a similar formulation was taught by Molinist and Jansenist Catholics . The priesthood of all believers downplayed the need for saints or priests to serve as mediators , and mandatory clerical celibacy was ended . Simul justus et peccator implied that although people could improve , no one could become good enough to earn forgiveness from God .",
  "/wiki/Rood_screen": "The rood screen ( also choir screen , chancel screen , or jub\u00e9 ) is a common feature in late medieval church architecture . It is typically an ornate partition between the chancel and nave , of more or less open tracery constructed of wood , stone , or wrought iron . The rood screen would originally have been surmounted by a rood loft carrying the Great Rood , a sculptural representation of the Crucifixion . In English , Scottish , and Welsh cathedrals , monastic , and collegiate churches , there were commonly two transverse screens , with a rood screen or rood beam located one bay west of the pulpitum screen , but this double arrangement nowhere survives complete , and accordingly the preserved pulpitum in such churches is sometimes referred to as a rood screen . At Wells Cathedral the medieval arrangement was restored in the 20th century , with the medieval strainer arch supporting a rood , placed in front of the pulpitum and organ . Rood screens can be found in churches in many parts of Europe , however , in Catholic countries they were generally removed during the Counter-reformation , when the retention of any visual barrier between the laity and the high altar was widely seen as inconsistent with the decrees of the Council of Trent . Accordingly , rood screens now survive in much greater numbers in Anglican and Lutheran churches ; with the greatest number of survivals complete with screen and rood figures in Scandinavia . The iconostasis in Eastern Christian churches is a visually similar barrier , but is now generally considered to have a different origin , deriving from the ancient altar screen or templon .

The three largest towns are Llanelli , Carmarthen and Ammanford . Carmarthen is the county town and administrative centre . Carmarthenshire has been inhabited since prehistoric times . The county town was founded by the Romans , and the region was part of the Principality of Deheubarth in the High Middle Ages . After invasion by the Normans in the 12th and 13th centuries it was subjugated , along with other parts of Wales , by Edward I of England . There was further unrest in the early 15th century , when the Welsh rebelled under Owain Glynd\u0175r , and during the English Civil War .

  "/wiki/Victorian_era": "In the history of the United Kingdom , the Victorian era was the period of Queen Victoria 's reign , from 20 June 1837 until her death on 22 January 1901 . The era followed the Georgian period and preceded the Edwardian period , and its later half overlaps with the first part of the Belle \u00c9poque era of Continental Europe . In terms of moral sensibilities and political reforms , this period began with the passage of the Reform Act 1832 . There was a strong religious drive for higher moral standards led by the nonconformist churches , such as the Methodists , and the Evangelical wing of the established Church of England . Britain 's relations with the other Great Powers were driven by the colonial antagonism of the Great Game with Russia , climaxing during the Crimean War ; a Pax Britannica of international free trade was maintained by the country 's naval and industrial supremacy . Britain embarked on global imperial expansion , particularly in Asia and Africa , which made the British Empire the largest empire in history . National self-confidence peaked . Ideologically , the Victorian era witnessed resistance to the rationalism that defined the Georgian period and an increasing turn towards romanticism and even mysticism with regard to religion , social values , and arts . Domestically , the political agenda was increasingly liberal , with a number of shifts in the direction of gradual political reform , social reform , and the widening of the franchise . There were unprecedented demographic changes : the population of England and Wales almost doubled from 16.8 million in 1851 to 30.5 million in 1901 , and Scotland 's population also rose rapidly , from 2.8 million in 1851 to 4.4 million in 1901 . However , Ireland 's population decreased sharply , from 8.2 million in 1841 to less than 4.5 million in 1901 , mostly due to emigration and the Great Famine . Between 1837 and 1901 about 15 million emigrated from Great Britain , mostly to the United States , Canada , South Africa , New Zealand , and Australia .",

  "/wiki/Piscina": "A piscina is a shallow basin placed near the altar of a church , or else in the vestry or sacristy , used for washing the communion vessels . The sacrarium is the drain itself . Anglicans usually refer to the basin , calling it a piscina . Roman Catholics usually refer to the drain , and by extension , the basin , as the sacrarium . They are often made of stone and fitted with a drain , and are in some cases used to dispose of materials used in the sacraments and water from liturgical ablutions . They are found in Roman Catholic , Anglican , and Lutheran churches , and a similar vessel is used in Eastern Orthodox churches .",
  "/wiki/Sedilia": "In church architecture , sedilia ( plural of Latin sed\u012ble , seat ) are seats , usually made of stone , found on the liturgical south side of an altar , often in the chancel , for use during Mass for the officiating priest and his assistants , the deacon and sub-deacon . The seat is often set back into the main wall of the church itself . Not all sedilia are stone ; there is a timber one thought to be 15th century in St Nicholas ' Church at Rodmersham in Kent . When there is only one such seat , the singular form sedile is used , as for instance at St Mary 's , Princes Risborough , Buckinghamshire or at St Agatha 's , Coates , West Sussex . The first examples in the catacombs were single inlays for the officiating priest . In time the more usual number became three , although there are examples of up to five sedilia . The custom of recessing them in the thickness of the wall began about the end of the 12th century ; some early examples consist only of stone benches , and there is one instance of a single seat or arm-chair in stone at Lenham in Kent . The niches or recesses into which they are sunk are often richly decorated with canopies and subdivided with moulded shafts , pinnacles and tabernacle work ; the seats are sometimes at different levels , the eastern being always the highest , and sometimes an additional niche is provided in which the piscina is placed .",

  "/wiki/Parish_church": "A parish church ( or parochial church ) in Christianity is the church which acts as the religious centre of a parish . In many parts of the world , especially in rural areas , the parish church may play a significant role in community activities , often allowing its premises to be used for non-religious community events .

  "/wiki/Pulpit": "A pulpit is a raised stand for preachers in a Christian church . The origin of the word is the Latin pulpitum ( platform or staging ) . The traditional pulpit is raised well above the surrounding floor for audibility and visibility , accessed by steps , with sides coming to about waist height . From the late medieval period onwards , pulpits have often had a canopy known as the sounding board or abat-voix above and sometimes also behind the speaker , normally in wood . Though sometimes highly decorated , this is not purely decorative , but can have a useful acoustic effect in projecting the preacher 's voice to the congregation below . Most pulpits have one or more book-stands for the preacher to rest his or her bible , notes or texts upon . The pulpit is generally reserved for clergy . This is mandated in the regulations of the Roman Catholic church , and several others ( though not always strictly observed ) . Even in Welsh Nonconformism , this was felt appropriate , and in some chapels a second pulpit was built opposite the main one for lay exhortations , testimonials and other speeches . Many churches have a second , smaller stand called the lectern , which can be used by lay persons , and is often used for all the readings and ordinary announcements . The traditional Catholic location of the pulpit to the side of the chancel or nave has been generally retained by Anglicans and some Protestant denominations , while in Presbyterian and Evangelical churches the pulpit has often replaced the altar at the centre . Equivalent platforms for speakers are the bema ( bima , bimah ) of Ancient Greece and Jewish synagogues , and the minbar of Islamic mosques .",
  "/wiki/Sounding_board": "A sounding board , also known as a tester and abat-voix is a structure placed above and sometimes also behind a pulpit or other speaking platforms which helps to project the sound of the speaker . It is usually made of wood . The structure may be specially shaped to assist the projection , for example , being formed as a parabolic reflector . In the typical setting of a church building , the sounding board may be ornately carved or constructed . The term abat-voix , from the French word for the same thing ( abattre ( to beat down ) + voix ( voice ) ) , is also used in English . Sounding board may also be used figuratively to describe a person who listens to a speech or proposal in order that the speaker may rehearse or explore the proposition more fully . The term is also used inter-personally to describe one person listening to another , and especially to their ideas . When a person listens and responds with comments , they provide a perspective that otherwise would not be available through introspection or thought alone .",

  "/wiki/Chancel": "In church architecture , the chancel is the space around the altar , including the choir and the sanctuary ( sometimes called the presbytery ) , at the liturgical east end of a traditional Christian church building . It may terminate in an apse . It is generally the area used by the clergy and choir during worship , while the congregation is in the nave . Direct access may be provided by a priest 's door , usually on the south side of the church . This is one definition , sometimes called the strict one ; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels , these are also often counted as part of the chancel , especially when discussing architecture . In smaller churches , where the altar is backed by the outside east wall and there is no distinct choir , the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area . In churches with a retroquire area behind the altar , this may only be included in the broader definition of chancel . In a cathedral or other large church , there may be a distinct choir area at the start of the chancel ( looking from the nave ) , before reaching the sanctuary , and an ambulatory may run beside and behind it . All these may be included in the chancel , at least in architectural terms ( see above ) . In many churches , the altar has now been moved to the front of the chancel , in what was built as the choir area , or to the centre of the transept , somewhat confusing the distinction between chancel , choir and sanctuary . In churches with less traditional plans , the term may not be useful in either architectural or ecclesiastical terms . The chancel may be a step or two higher than the level of the nave , and the sanctuary is often raised still further .",
  "/wiki/Vestry": "A vestry was a committee for the local secular and ecclesiastical government for a parish in England and Wales , which originally met in the vestry or sacristy of the parish church , and consequently became known colloquially as the vestry . For many centuries the vestries were the sole de facto local government and presided over local , communal fundraising and expenditure until the mid or late 19th century with local Established Church chairmanship . More punitive matters tended to be dealt with by the manorial court and hundred court during the epoch of the vestries . Their initial power derived from custom and was very occasionally ratified by the common law or asserted in statute such as the Elizabethan Poor Law . At the high point of their powers before removal of Poor Law responsibilities in 1834 , the vestries spent not far short of one-fifth of the budget of the British government which derived much of its income from global trade and imperialism . Secular and ecclesiastical aspects of the vestries were separated , for all areas where they had not earlier been , under a reforming statute of 1894 . Their secular duties have been performed in England since then by parish councils or more superior councils , leaving their ecclesiastical duties to the Church of England where they have been performed by parochial church councils ( PCCs ) since 1921 . Realised secularisation of local government was opposed by administrations of the Tory Party preceding the Third Salisbury ministry , the British government led by Lord Salisbury from 1895 to 1900 and several earlier influential High Whigs . A public right in the PCC ( church ) meeting remains in that all Members of an overlapping civil parish can speak at their annual meetings ( which may appoint churchwardens for instance ) . A right to tax by a PCC for church chancel repairs remains as to liable ( apportioned ) local residents and businesses across an apportioned area of many church parishes , in the form of chancel repair liability however in some tithes were replaced by no further such taxation .",

  "/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_Movement": "The Arts and Crafts movement was an international trend in the decorative and fine arts that began in Britain and flourished in Europe and North America between about 1880 and 1920 , emerging in Japan in the 1920s as the Mingei movement . It stood for traditional craftsmanship using simple forms , and often used medieval , romantic , or folk styles of decoration . It advocated economic and social reform and was essentially anti-industrial . It had a strong influence on the arts in Europe until it was displaced by Modernism in the 1930s , and its influence continued among craft makers , designers , and town planners long afterwards . The term was first used by T. J. Cobden-Sanderson at a meeting of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1887 , although the principles and style on which it was based had been developing in England for at least 20 years . It was inspired by the ideas of architect Augustus Pugin , writer John Ruskin , and designer William Morris . The movement developed earliest and most fully in the British Isles and spread across the British Empire and to the rest of Europe and America . It was largely a reaction against the perceived impoverishment of the decorative arts at the time and the conditions in which they were produced .",

  "/wiki/Tracery": "In architecture , tracery is the stonework elements that support the glass in a Gothic window . The term probably derives from the 'tracing floors ' on which the complex patterns of late Gothic windows were laid out . There are two main types , plate tracery and the later bar tracery . The evolving style from Romanesque to Gothic architecture and changing features , like the thinning of lateral walls and enlarging of windows lead to the innovation of tracery . The earliest form of tracery , called plate tracery , began as openings that were pierced from a stone slab . Bar tracery was then implemented , having derived from the plate tracery . However instead of a slab , the windows were defined by molded stone mullions which were lighter and allowed for more openings and intricate designs . Other notable styles of tracery to follow include geometrical tracery and curvilinear ( flowing ) tracery .",
