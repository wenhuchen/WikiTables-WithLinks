  "/wiki/Brick_Tavern_House": "The Brick Tavern House is a former inn on the National Road west of St. Clairsville , Ohio , United States . One of the oldest National Road taverns still in existence , it was built in the early nineteenth century . Although it fell into dilapidation during the late twentieth century , it was named a historic site in 1995 , and extensive restoration was to be performed in the early 2010s but to date , has not been . The tavern 's construction date varies widely in different sources . A history of Belmont County published in 1903 proposed that it had been built in 1812 ; the U.S. Department of Transportation believes that it was constructed in 1828 ; a restoration firm , Centennial Preservation Group , states that it was erected in 1825 ; and the National Park Service gives its construction year as 1831 . Built of brick on a foundation of sandstone , the tavern is covered with a tin roof and features elements of sandstone and slate . The two-and-a-half-story building features a gabled roof , while the overall design includes a rear ell faced by porches on both sides . Numerous taverns were constructed along the National Road in its earliest years , as the road saw its golden years between 1825 and 1845 . However , the coming of railroads later in the century relegated the road to a farm track by 1900 , and its businesses and towns were reduced to serving only local needs . Although it survived the neglect of long-distance travelers , the Brick Tavern House gradually fell into dilapidation ; by 2012 , its windows were boarded up , and the entire structure was tending toward collapse , even though it was part of the campus of Ohio University East . To save the building , the university applied for historic preservation grants from the federal government , and in September 2006 the U.S. Department of Transportation announced that they had been awarded $ 128,000 for restoration . Restoration was forced to wait ; early 2012 saw the tavern still deteriorating amid a protracted bidding process .",

  "/wiki/Joseph_Kirkwood_House": "The Joseph Kirkwood House is a historic house in the village of Bridgeport , Ohio , United States . Originally home to one of the area 's oldest families , it was built in the middle of the nineteenth century in a mix of architectural styles . Named a historic site in the 1980s , it has been converted into a health care facility . A native of Delaware , Robert Kirkwood emigrated to present-day Belmont County in 1789 after fighting in the American Revolution ; he and his family were among the region 's first settlers . Joseph his son erected the present house in 1846 and arranged for its expansion seven years later by the construction of a large ell to the rear . Set on a foundation of sandstone , the wood-and-brick house is covered with a metal roof . The house combines academic and popular architectural styles : the basic plan is that of an I-house , a vernacular construction mode , although Greek Revival styling is present , especially in the careful symmetry of the five-bay facade . Nine windows fill all bays in both stories , except for the post and lintel-surrounded main entrance in the center of the first story . The fenestration on the side of the original house and on the addition is more irregular : on the second story , a single window sits under the gable , separated by large amounts of brick from a trio of windows at the rear of the ell . Chimneys are placed at both ends of the roofline on the original house , with another such structure in the ell ; the roof itself is metal . In early 1986 , the Kirkwood House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places ; its connection to Joseph Kirkwood qualified it for designation , as did its historically significant architecture . It is one of two National Register-listed locations in Bridgeport : although located largely in Wheeling , West Virginia across the Ohio River , the Wheeling Island Historic District includes the Aetnaville Bridge , which extends into Bridgeport .",

  "/wiki/Morristown_Historic_District": "The Morristown Historic District is a nationally recognized historic district embracing much of the village of Morristown , Ohio , United States . Founded along the National Road , Morristown prospered as long as the road was heavily travelled , but it stagnated after railroads became prominent . Because the community neither died nor prospered , it has retained its mid-nineteenth-century architecture into the present , making it one of the National Road 's least-changed settlements . Settled in the early nineteenth century , Morristown prospered after the National Road became its main street in 1826 . In its first decades , the village was heavily dependent on the road ; during the village 's best years , in the 1850s , more than forty National Road-related businesses lined its streets . However , prosperity departed soon afterward : railroads were built through eastern Ohio in the 1850s , supplanting the National Road as the major mode of transportation , and because no railroad served Morristown , it lost most of its commerce . Buildings continued to be erected into the 1870s , but comparatively little construction occurred in later decades . Nevertheless , the village remained , and benign neglect contributed to Morristown 's preservation : no other National Road community in eastern Ohio has experienced so few changes since the road 's heyday . Part of its significance derives from construction methods . Most buildings are vernacular structures built of brick in Flemish bond , setting Morristown apart from surrounding communities , which possess few historic brick buildings . In early 1980 , the Morristown Historic District was declared , with boundaries encompassing 42 acres ( 17 ha ) ; seventy of the district 's eighty-six buildings were rated as contributing properties , as was the village cemetery . Limited destruction and limited new construction has left Morristown with nearly all of its mid-19th century built environment , enabling the district to qualify for the Register both because of its place in area history and because of its historic architecture .",
