  "/wiki/Film_noir": "Film noir ( /nw\u0251\u02d0r/ ; French : [ film nwa\u0281 ] ) is a cinematic term used primarily to describe stylish Hollywood crime dramas , particularly those that emphasize cynical attitudes and sexual motivations . The 1940s and 1950s are generally regarded as the classic period of American film noir . Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key , black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography . Many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Great Depression . The term film noir , French for black film ( literal ) or dark film ( closer meaning ) , was first applied to Hollywood films by French critic Nino Frank in 1946 , but was unrecognized by most American film industry professionals of that era . Cinema historians and critics defined the category retrospectively . Before the notion was widely adopted in the 1970s , many of the classic film noir [ a ] were referred to as melodramas . Whether film noir qualifies as a distinct genre is a matter of ongoing debate among scholars . Film noir encompasses a range of plots : the central figure may be a private investigator ( The Big Sleep ) , a plainclothes policeman ( The Big Heat ) , an aging boxer ( The Set-Up ) , a hapless grifter ( Night and the City ) , a law-abiding citizen lured into a life of crime ( Gun Crazy ) , or simply a victim of circumstance ( D.O.A. ) . Although film noir was originally associated with American productions , the term has been used to describe films from around the world . Many films released from the 1960s onward share attributes with film noirs of the classical period , and often treat its conventions self-referentially . Some refer to such latter-day works as neo-noir .",

Chess is believed to be derived from the Indian game chaturanga sometime before the 7th century . Chaturanga is also the likely ancestor of the Eastern strategy games xiangqi ( Chinese chess ) , janggi ( Korean chess ) , and shogi ( Japanese chess ) . Chess reached Europe by the 9th century , due to the Umayyad conquest of Hispania . The pieces assumed their current powers in Spain in the late 15th century ; the modern rules were standardized in the 19th century . Play involves no hidden information . Each player begins with 16 pieces : one king , one queen , two rooks , two knights , two bishops , and eight pawns . Each piece type moves differently , with the most powerful being the queen and the least powerful the pawn . The objective is to checkmate [ note 1 ] the opponent 's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture . To this end , a player 's pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent 's pieces , while supporting each other . During the game , play typically involves exchanging pieces for the opponent 's similar pieces , and finding and engineering opportunities to trade advantageously or to get a better position .",
