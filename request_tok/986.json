  "/wiki/Volksgerichtshof": "The People 's Court ( German : Volksgerichtshof ) was a Sondergericht ( special court ) of Nazi Germany , set up outside the operations of the constitutional frame of law . Its headquarters were originally located in the former Prussian House of Lords in Berlin , later moved to the former K\u00f6nigsberg Wilhelmsgymnasium at Bellevuestrasse 15 in Potsdamer Platz ( the location now occupied by the Sony Center ; a marker is located on the sidewalk nearby ) . The court was established in 1934 by order of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler , in response to his dissatisfaction at the outcome of the Reichstag fire trial , in which all but one of the defendants were acquitted . The court had jurisdiction over a rather broad array of political offenses , which included crimes like black marketeering , work slowdowns , defeatism , and treason against the Third Reich . These crimes were viewed by the court as Wehrkraftzersetzung ( disintegration of defensive capability ) and were accordingly punished severely ; the death penalty was meted out in numerous cases . The Court handed down an enormous number of death sentences under Judge-President Roland Freisler , including those that followed the plot to kill Hitler on 20 July 1944 . Many of those found guilty by the Court were executed in Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison in Berlin . The proceedings of the court were often even less than show trials in that some cases , such as that of Sophie Scholl and her brother Hans Scholl and fellow White Rose activists , trials were concluded in less than an hour without evidence being presented or arguments made by either side . The president of the court often acted as prosecutor , denouncing defendants , then pronouncing his verdict and sentence without objection from defense counsel , who usually remained silent throughout . It almost always sided with the prosecution , to the point that being hauled before it was tantamount to a death sentence . While Nazi Germany was not a rule of law state , the People 's Court frequently dispensed with even the nominal laws and procedures of regular German trials , and was thus easily characterized as a kangaroo court .",

  "/wiki/Normandy_landings": "The Normandy landings were the landing operations on Tuesday , 6 June 1944 of the Allied invasion of Normandy in Operation Overlord during World War II . Codenamed Operation Neptune and often referred to as D-Day , it was the largest seaborne invasion in history . The operation began the liberation of German-occupied France ( and later western Europe ) and laid the foundations of the Allied victory on the Western Front . Planning for the operation began in 1943 . In the months leading up to the invasion , the Allies conducted a substantial military deception , codenamed Operation Bodyguard , to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings . The weather on D-Day was far from ideal , and the operation had to be delayed 24 hours ; a further postponement would have meant a delay of at least two weeks , as the invasion planners had requirements for the phase of the moon , the tides , and the time of day that meant only a few days each month were deemed suitable . Adolf Hitler placed German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in command of German forces and of developing fortifications along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion . The amphibious landings were preceded by extensive aerial and naval bombardment and an airborne assault - the landing of 24,000 American , British , and Canadian airborne troops shortly after midnight . Allied infantry and armoured divisions began landing on the coast of France at 06:30 . The target 50-mile ( 80 km ) stretch of the Normandy coast was divided into five sectors : Utah , Omaha , Gold , Juno , and Sword . Strong winds blew the landing craft east of their intended positions , particularly at Utah and Omaha . The men landed under heavy fire from gun emplacements overlooking the beaches , and the shore was mined and covered with obstacles such as wooden stakes , metal tripods , and barbed wire , making the work of the beach-clearing teams difficult and dangerous .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Britain": "The Battle of Britain ( German : die Luftschlacht um England , the Air Battle for England ) was a military campaign of the Second World War , in which the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) defended the United Kingdom ( UK ) against large-scale attacks by Nazi Germany 's air force , the Luftwaffe . It has been described as the first major military campaign fought entirely by air forces . The British officially recognise the battle 's duration as being from 10 July until 31 October 1940 , which overlaps the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz , that lasted from 7 September 1940 to 11 May 1941 . German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard the battle as a single campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941 , including the Blitz . The primary objective of the German forces was to compel Britain to agree to a negotiated peace settlement . In July 1940 , the air and sea blockade began , with the Luftwaffe mainly targeting coastal-shipping convoys , ports and shipping centres , such as Portsmouth . On 1 August , the Luftwaffe was directed to achieve air superiority over the RAF with the aim of incapacitating RAF Fighter Command ; 12 days later , it shifted the attacks to RAF airfields and infrastructure . As the battle progressed , the Luftwaffe also targeted factories involved in aircraft production and strategic infrastructure . Eventually , it employed terror bombing on areas of political significance and on civilians . [ nb 9 ] The Germans had rapidly overwhelmed France and the Low Countries , leaving Britain to face the threat of invasion by sea . The German high command knew the difficulties of a seaborne attack and its impracticality while the Royal Navy controlled the English Channel and the North Sea .

  "/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bulge": "The Battle of the Bulge , also known as the Ardennes Counteroffensive , was the last major German offensive campaign on the Western Front during World War II , and took place from 16 December 1944 to 25 January 1945 . It was launched through the densely forested Ardennes region of Wallonia in eastern Belgium , northeast France , and Luxembourg , towards the end of the war in Europe . The offensive was intended to stop Allied use of the Belgian port of Antwerp and to split the Allied lines , allowing the Germans to encircle and destroy four Allied armies and force the Western Allies to negotiate a peace treaty in the Axis powers ' favor . The Germans achieved a total surprise attack on the morning of 16 December 1944 , due to a combination of Allied overconfidence , preoccupation with Allied offensive plans , and poor aerial reconnaissance due to bad weather . American forces bore the brunt of the attack and incurred their highest casualties of any operation during the war . The battle also severely depleted Germany 's armored forces , and they were largely unable to replace them . German personnel and , later , Luftwaffe aircraft ( in the concluding stages of the engagement ) also sustained heavy losses . The Germans had attacked a weakly defended section of the Allied line , taking advantage of heavily overcast weather conditions that grounded the Allies ' overwhelmingly superior air forces . Fierce resistance on the northern shoulder of the offensive , around Elsenborn Ridge , and in the south , around Bastogne , blocked German access to key roads to the northwest and west that they counted on for success . Columns of armor and infantry that were supposed to advance along parallel routes found themselves on the same roads . This , and terrain that favored the defenders , threw the German advance behind schedule and allowed the Allies to reinforce the thinly placed troops . The farthest west the offensive reached was the village of Foy-N\u00f4tre-Dame , south east of Dinant , being stopped by the U.S. 2nd Armored Division on 24 December 1944 .",

She became celebrated for her daring exploits in intelligence and irregular-warfare missions in Nazi-occupied Poland and France . Journalist Alistair Horne , who described himself in 2012 as one of the few people still alive who had known Skarbek , described her as the bravest of the brave . She became a British agent months before the SOE was founded in July 1940 . She was the first female agent of the British to serve in the field and the longest-serving of all Britain 's wartime women agents . Her resourcefulness and success have been credited with influencing the organisation 's decision to recruit more women . In 1941 she began using the nom de guerre Christine Granville , a name she legally adopted upon naturalisation as a British subject in December 1946 . Skarbek 's most famous exploit was securing the release of SOE agents Francis Cammaerts and Xan Fielding from a German prison hours before they were to be executed . She did so by meeting with the Gestapo commander in Digne-les-Bains , France , telling him she was a British agent , and persuading him with threats , lies , and a two million franc bribe to release the SOE agents . The event is fictionalized in the last episode of the British television show Wish Me Luck . Skarbek is often characterized in terms such as Britain 's most glamorous spy .

Geologically , the range is a western extension of the Eifel , and both were raised during the Givetian age of the Devonian ( 382.7 to 387.7 million years ago ) , as were several other named ranges of the same greater range . Located primarily in Belgium and Luxembourg , but stretching as well into Germany and France ( lending its name to the Ardennes department and the former Champagne-Ardenne region ) , and geologically into the Eifel - the eastern extension of the Ardennes Forest into Bitburg-Pr\u00fcm , Germany , most of the Ardennes proper consists of southeastern Wallonia , the southern and more rural part of the Kingdom of Belgium ( away from the coastal plain but encompassing more than half of the country 's total area ) . The eastern part of the Ardennes forms the northernmost third of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg , also called Oesling ( Luxembourgish : \u00c9islek ) . On the southeast the Eifel region continues into the German state of the Rhineland-Palatinate . The trees and rivers of the Ardennes provided the charcoal industry assets that enabled the great industrial period of Wallonia in the 18th and 19th centuries , when it was arguably the second great industrial region of the world , after England . The greater region maintained an industrial eminence into the 20th century , after coal replaced charcoal in metallurgy . Allied generals in World War II believed that the region was impenetrable to massed vehicular traffic and especially armor , so the area was effectively all but undefended [ citation needed ] during the war .

  "/wiki/Dambusters_(2008_film)": "The Dam Busters is a 1955 British epic war film starring Richard Todd and Michael Redgrave . It was directed by Michael Anderson . The film recreates the true story of Operation Chastise when in 1943 the RAF 's 617 Squadron attacked the M\u00f6hne , Eder , and Sorpe dams in Nazi Germany with Barnes Wallis 's bouncing bomb . The film was based on the books The Dam Busters ( 1951 ) by Paul Brickhill and Enemy Coast Ahead ( 1946 ) by Guy Gibson . The film 's reflective last minutes convey the poignant mix of emotions felt by the characters - triumph over striking a successful blow against the enemy 's industrial base is tempered by the sobering knowledge that many died in the process of delivering it . The film was widely praised and became the most popular motion picture at British cinemas in 1955 . In 1999 , the British Film Institute voted The Dam Busters the 68th greatest British film of the 20th century .

  "/wiki/Carl_Gustaf_Emil_Mannerheim": "Baron Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim ( Swedish pronunciation : [ k\u0251\u02d0\u026d \u02c8\u0261\u0275\u0302s\u02d0tav \u02c8\u011b\u02d0m\u026al \u02c8m\u00e2n\u02d0\u025br\u02cchejm ] ( listen ) ; 4 June 1867 - 27 January 1951 ) was a Finnish military leader and statesman . Mannerheim served as the military leader of the Whites in the Finnish Civil War , Regent of Finland ( 1918-1919 ) , commander-in-chief of Finland 's defence forces during World War II , Marshal of Finland , and the sixth president of Finland ( 1944-1946 ) . Mannerheim made a career in the Imperial Russian Army , rising to the rank of lieutenant general . He also had a prominent place in the ceremonies for Tsar Nicholas II 's coronation and later had several private meetings with the Tsar . After the Bolshevik revolution , Finland declared its independence but was soon embroiled in civil war between the pro-Bolshevik Reds and the Whites , who were the troops of the Senate of Finland , supported by troops of the German Empire . Mannerheim was appointed the military chief of the Whites . Twenty years later , when Finland was twice at war with the Soviet Union from November 1939 until September 1944 , Mannerheim successfully led the defence of Finland as commander-in-chief of the country 's armed forces . In 1944 , when the prospect of Germany 's defeat in World War II became clear , Mannerheim was elected President of Finland and oversaw peace negotiations with the Soviet Union and the UK . He resigned the presidency in 1946 and died in 1951 . In a Finnish survey 53 years after his death , Mannerheim was voted the greatest Finn of all time . Given the broad recognition in Finland and elsewhere of his unparalleled role in establishing and later preserving Finland 's independence from Russia , Mannerheim has long been referred to as the father of modern Finland , and the Finnish capital Helsinki 's Mannerheim Museum memorializing the leader 's life and times has been called the closest thing there is to a [ Finnish ] national shrine . In addition , he is the only Finn to have held the rank of field marshal , an honorary rank bestowed upon especially distinguished generals .",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Monte_Cassino": "The Battle of Monte Cassino ( also known as the Battle for Rome and the Battle for Cassino ) was a costly series of four assaults by the Allies against the Winter Line in Italy held by Axis forces during the Italian Campaign of World War II . The intention was a breakthrough to Rome . At the beginning of 1944 , the western half of the Winter Line was being anchored by Germans holding the Rapido-Gari , Liri and Garigliano valleys and some of the surrounding peaks and ridges . Together , these features formed the Gustav Line . Monte Cassino , a historic hilltop abbey founded in AD 529 by Benedict of Nursia , dominated the nearby town of Cassino and the entrances to the Liri and Rapido valleys . Lying in a protected historic zone , it had been left unoccupied by the Germans , although they manned some positions set into the steep slopes below the abbey 's walls . Repeated pinpoint artillery attacks on Allied assault troops caused their leaders to conclude the abbey was being used by the Germans as an observation post , at the very least . Fears escalated along with casualties and in spite of a lack of clear evidence , it was marked for destruction . On 15 February American bombers dropped 1,400 tons of high explosives , creating widespread damage . The raid failed to achieve its objective , as German paratroopers then occupied the rubble and established excellent defensive positions amid the ruins . Between 17 January and 18 May , Monte Cassino and the Gustav defences were assaulted four times by Allied troops . On 16 May , soldiers from the Polish II Corps launched one of the final assaults on the German defensive position as part of a twenty-division assault along a twenty-mile front .",
  "/wiki/Italian_Campaign_(World_War_II)": "The Italian campaign of World War II consisted of Allied and Axis operations in and around Italy , from 1943 to 1945 . The Joint Allied Forces Headquarters ( AFHQ ) was operationally responsible for all Allied land forces in the Mediterranean theatre and it planned and led the invasion of Sicily in July 1943 , followed in September by the invasion of the Italian mainland and the campaign in Italy until the surrender of the German Armed Forces in Italy in May 1945 . It is estimated that between September 1943 and April 1945 , 60,000-70,000 Allied and 38,805-150,660 German soldiers died in Italy . [ nb 1 ] The number of Allied casualties was about 320,000 and the German figure ( excluding those involved in the final surrender ) was over 330,000 . [ nb 2 ] Fascist Italy , prior to its collapse , suffered about 200,000 casualties , mostly POWs taken in the Allied invasion of Sicily , including more than 40,000 killed or missing . Over 150,000 Italian civilians died , as did 35,828 anti-fascist partisans and some 35,000 troops of the Italian Social Republic . On the Western Front of World War II , Italy was the most costly campaign in terms of casualties suffered by infantry forces of both sides , during bitter small-scale fighting around strongpoints at the Winter Line , the Anzio beachhead and the Gothic Line . The Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943 led to the collapse of the Fascist Italian regime and the fall of Mussolini , who was deposed and arrested by order of King Victor Emmanuel III on 25 July . The new government signed an armistice with the Allies on 8 September 1943 . However , German forces soon took control of northern and central Italy ; Mussolini , who was rescued by German paratroopers , established a collaborationist puppet state , the Italian Social Republic ( RSI ) to administer the German-occupied territory . The Germans , often with Italian fascists , also committed several atrocities against civilians and non-fascist troops . As result , the Italian Co-Belligerent Army was created to fight against the RSI and its German allies , alongside the large Italian resistance movement , while other Italian troops , loyal to Mussolini , continued to fight alongside the Germans in the National Republican Army .",

  "/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa": "Operation Barbarossa ( German : Unternehmen Barbarossa ) was the code name for the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union , which started on Sunday , 22 June 1941 , during World War II . The operation put into action Nazi Germany 's ideological goal of conquering the western Soviet Union so as to repopulate it with Germans . The German Generalplan Ost aimed to use some of the conquered as slave labour for the Axis war effort , to acquire the oil reserves of the Caucasus and the agricultural resources of Soviet territories , and eventually to annihilate the Slavic peoples and create Lebensraum for Germany . In the two years leading up to the invasion , Germany and the Soviet Union signed political and economic pacts for strategic purposes . Nevertheless , the German High Command began planning an invasion of the Soviet Union in July 1940 ( under the codename Operation Otto ) , which Adolf Hitler authorized on 18 December 1940 . Over the course of the operation , about three million personnel of the Axis powers - the largest invasion force in the history of warfare - invaded the western Soviet Union along a 2,900-kilometer ( 1,800 mi ) front , with 600,000 motor vehicles and over 600,000 horses for non-combat operations . The offensive marked an escalation of World War II , both geographically and in the formation of the Allied coalition including the Soviet Union . The operation opened up the Eastern Front , in which more forces were committed than in any other theater of war in history . The area saw some of the war 's largest battles , most horrific atrocities , and highest casualties ( for Soviet and Axis forces alike ) , all of which influenced the course of World War II and the subsequent history of the 20th century . The German armies eventually captured some 5,000,000 Soviet Red Army troops , a majority of whom never returned alive .

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Midway": "The Battle of Midway was a decisive naval battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II that took place on 4-7 June 1942 , six months after Japan 's attack on Pearl Harbor and one month after the Battle of the Coral Sea . The United States Navy under Admirals Chester W. Nimitz , Frank J. Fletcher , and Raymond A. Spruance defeated an attacking fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy under Admirals Isoroku Yamamoto , Ch\u016bichi Nagumo , and Nobutake Kond\u014d near Midway Atoll , inflicting devastating damage on the Japanese fleet that proved irreparable . Military historian John Keegan called it the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare , while naval historian Craig Symonds called it one of the most consequential naval engagements in world history , ranking alongside Salamis , Trafalgar , and Tsushima Strait , as both tactically decisive and strategically influential . The Japanese operation , like the earlier attack on Pearl Harbor , sought to eliminate the United States as a strategic power in the Pacific , thereby giving Japan a free hand in establishing its Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere . The Japanese hoped another demoralizing defeat would force the U.S. to capitulate in the Pacific War and thus ensure Japanese dominance in the Pacific . Luring the American aircraft carriers into a trap and occupying Midway was part of an overall barrier strategy to extend Japan 's defensive perimeter , in response to the Doolittle air raid on Tokyo . This operation was also considered preparatory for further attacks against Fiji , Samoa , and Hawaii itself . The plan was handicapped by faulty Japanese assumptions of the American reaction and poor initial dispositions . Most significantly , American cryptographers were able to determine the date and location of the planned attack , enabling the forewarned U.S. Navy to prepare its own ambush . Four Japanese and three American aircraft carriers participated in the battle . The four Japanese fleet carriers - Akagi , Kaga , S\u014dry\u016b and Hiry\u016b , part of the six-carrier force that had attacked Pearl Harbor six months earlier - were sunk , as was the heavy cruiser Mikuma . The U.S. lost the carrier Yorktown and the destroyer Hammann ."
