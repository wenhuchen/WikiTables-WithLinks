  "/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)": "A conglomerate is a multi-industry company - i.e. , a combination of multiple business entities operating in entirely different industries under one corporate group , usually involving a parent company and many subsidiaries . Conglomerates are often large and multinational . Conglomerates were popular in the 1960s due to a combination of low interest rates and a repeating bear-bull market , which allowed the conglomerates to buy companies in leveraged buyouts , sometimes at temporarily deflated values . Famous examples from the 1960s include Ling-Temco-Vought , ITT Corporation , Litton Industries , Textron , Teledyne . Because of low interest on the loans , the overall return on investment of the conglomerate appeared to grow . In addition , the conglomerate had a better ability to borrow in the money market , or capital market , than the smaller firm at their community bank . [ citation needed ] For many years this was enough to make the company 's stock price rise , as companies were often valued largely on their return on investment . The aggressive nature of the conglomerators themselves was enough to make many investors , who saw a powerful and seemingly unstoppable force in business , buy their stock . [ citation needed ] High stock prices allowed them to raise more loans , based on the value of their stock , and thereby buy even more companies . This led to a chain reaction , which allowed them to grow very rapidly . However , all of this growth was somewhat illusory and when interest rates rose to offset inflation , conglomerate profits fell . Investors noticed that the companies inside the conglomerate were growing no faster than before they were purchased , whereas the rationale for buying a company was that synergies would provide efficiency .",

As the seat of the United States federal government and several international organizations , Washington is an important world political capital . The city , located on the Potomac River bordering Maryland and Virginia , is one of the most visited cities in the world , with more than 20 million tourists annually . The signing of the Residence Act on July 16 , 1790 , approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River on the country 's East Coast . The U.S. Constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress , and the District is therefore not a part of any U.S. state . The states of Maryland and Virginia each donated land to form the federal district , which included the pre-existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria . The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital . In 1846 , Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia , including the city of Alexandria ; in 1871 , it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District . Washington had an estimated population of 702,455 as of July 2018 [ update ] , making it the 20th most populous city in the United States .

  "/wiki/Construction": "Construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure . Construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser , while construction typically takes place on location for a known client . Construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries . Construction starts with planning , design , and financing ; it continues until the project is built and ready for use . Large-scale construction requires collaboration across multiple disciplines . A project manager normally manages the budget on the job , and a construction manager , design engineer , construction engineer or architect supervises it . Those involved with the design and execution must consider zoning requirements , environmental impact of the job , scheduling , budgeting , construction-site safety , availability and transportation of building materials , logistics , inconvenience to the public caused by construction delays and bidding . Large construction projects are sometimes referred to as megaprojects ."
