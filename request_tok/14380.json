  "/wiki/Takeshi_Kitano": "Takeshi Kitano ( \u5317\u91ce \u6b66 , Kitano Takeshi , born 18 January 1947 ) is a Japanese comedian , television presenter , actor , filmmaker , and author . While he is known primarily as a comedian and TV host in his native Japan , abroad he is known almost exclusively for his work as a filmmaker . With the exception of his works as a film director , he is known almost exclusively by the stage name Beat Takeshi ( \u30d3\u30fc\u30c8\u305f\u3051\u3057 , B\u012bto Takeshi ) . Kitano rose to prominence in the 1970s as one half of the comedy duo Two Beat , before going solo and becoming one of the three biggest comedians in the country . After several small acting roles , he made his directorial debut with 1989 's Violent Cop and garnered international acclaim for Sonatine ( 1993 ) . He was not widely accepted as an accomplished director in Japan until Hana-bi won the Golden Lion in 1997 . In October 2017 , Kitano completed his Outrage crime trilogy with the release of Outrage Coda . He has received critical acclaim for his idiosyncratic cinematic work , winning numerous awards with Japanese film critic Nagaharu Yodogawa having once dubbed him the true successor to influential filmmaker Akira Kurosawa . Many of Kitano 's films are dramas about yakuza gangsters or the police . Described by critics as using an acting style that is highly deadpan or a camera style that approaches near-stasis , Kitano often uses long takes during which little appears to be happening , or editing that cuts immediately to the aftermath of an event . Many of his films express a bleak worldview , but are also filled with humor and affection for their characters .",
