John Bunyan ( 1628 - 1688 ) , a Christian writer and preacher , was born in Harrowden ( one mile south-east of Bedford ) , in the Parish of Elstow , England . He wrote The Pilgrim 's Progress , arguably the most famous published Christian allegory . In the Church of England he is remembered with a Lesser Festival on 30 August . In 1672 , the congregation led by Bunyan purchased a barn which they used to conduct worship . Eventually , a church , which came to be called the Bunyan Meeting Free Church , was built on the site of the barn . In 1849 , a second church was built which is still used for services . A separate museum building was constructed in the compound in 1998 and the Bunyan artefacts and memorabilia formerly housed in a small museum room in the church were moved into it . The museum 's displays recreate a number of scenes from Bunyan 's life which also show some of Bedford 's social history in the seventeenth century .

  "/wiki/John_Bunyan": "John Bunyan ( /\u02c8b\u028cnj\u0259n/ ; baptised November 30 , 1628 - August 31 , 1688 ) was an English writer and Puritan preacher best remembered as the author of the Christian allegory The Pilgrim 's Progress . In addition to The Pilgrim 's Progress , Bunyan wrote nearly sixty titles , many of them expanded sermons . Bunyan came from the village of Elstow , near Bedford . He had some schooling and at the age of sixteen joined the Parliamentary Army during the first stage of the English Civil War . After three years in the army he returned to Elstow and took up the trade of tinker , which he had learned from his father . He became interested in religion after his marriage , attending first the parish church and then joining the Bedford Meeting , a nonconformist group in Bedford , and becoming a preacher . After the restoration of the monarch , when the freedom of nonconformists was curtailed , Bunyan was arrested and spent the next twelve years in jail as he refused to give up preaching . During this time he wrote a spiritual autobiography , Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners , and began work on his most famous book , The Pilgrim 's Progress , which was not published until some years after his release . Bunyan 's later years , in spite of another shorter term of imprisonment , were spent in relative comfort as a popular author and preacher , and pastor of the Bedford Meeting . He died aged 59 after falling ill on a journey to London and is buried in Bunhill Fields . The Pilgrim 's Progress became one of the most published books in the English language ; 1,300 editions having been printed by 1938 , 250 years after the author 's death .

  "/wiki/The_Pilgrim's_Progress": "The Pilgrim 's Progress from This World , to That Which Is to Come is a 1678 Christian allegory written by John Bunyan . It is regarded as one of the most significant works of religious , theological fiction in English literature . It has been translated into more than 200 languages , and has never been out of print . It has also been cited as the first novel written in English . Bunyan began his work while in the Bedfordshire county prison for violations of the Conventicle Act of 1664 , which prohibited the holding of religious services outside the auspices of the established Church of England . Early Bunyan scholars such as John Brown believed The Pilgrim 's Progress was begun in Bunyan 's second , shorter imprisonment for six months in 1675 , but more recent scholars such as Roger Sharrock believe that it was begun during Bunyan 's initial , more lengthy imprisonment from 1660 to 1672 right after he had written his spiritual autobiography Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners . The English text comprises 108,260 words and is divided into two parts , each reading as a continuous narrative with no chapter divisions . The first part was completed in 1677 and entered into the Stationers ' Register on 22 December 1677 . It was licensed and entered in the Term Catalogue on 18 February 1678 , which is looked upon as the date of first publication . After the first edition of the first part in 1678 , an expanded edition , with additions written after Bunyan was freed , appeared in 1679 . The Second Part appeared in 1684 . There were eleven editions of the first part in John Bunyan 's lifetime , published in successive years from 1678 to 1685 and in 1688 , and there were two editions of the second part , published in 1684 and 1686 .",

Julius Caesar invaded Britain in 55 and 54 BC as part of his Gallic Wars . According to Caesar , the Britons had been overrun or culturally assimilated by other Celtic tribes during the British Iron Age and had been aiding Caesar 's enemies .

In 40 AD , Caligula assembled 200,000 men at the Channel on the continent , only to have them gather seashells ( musculi ) according to Suetonius , perhaps as a symbolic gesture to proclaim Caligula 's victory over the sea . Three years later , Claudius directed four legions to invade Britain and restore the exiled king Verica over the Atrebates .

  "/wiki/HM_Bark_Endeavour": "HMS Endeavour , also known as HM Bark Endeavour , was a British Royal Navy research vessel that Lieutenant James Cook commanded to Australia and New Zealand on his first voyage of discovery from 1768 to 1771 . She was launched in 1764 as the collier Earl of Pembroke , with the Navy purchasing her in 1768 for a scientific mission to the Pacific Ocean and to explore the seas for the surmised Terra Australis Incognita or unknown southern land . Commissioned as His Majesty 's Bark Endeavour , she departed Plymouth in August 1768 , rounded Cape Horn and reached Tahiti in time to observe the 1769 transit of Venus across the Sun . She then set sail into the largely uncharted ocean to the south , stopping at the islands of Huahine , Bora Bora , and Raiatea west of Tahiti to allow Cook to claim them for Great Britain . In September 1769 , she anchored off New Zealand , becoming the first European vessel to reach the islands since Abel Tasman 's Heemskerck 127 years earlier . In April 1770 , Endeavour became the first ship to reach the east coast of Australia , with Cook going ashore at what is now known as Botany Bay . Endeavour then sailed north along the Australian coast next stopping at the now-town of Seventeen Seventy/Agnes Water in late May 1770 . She narrowly avoided disaster after running aground on the Great Barrier Reef , and Cook had to throw her guns overboard to lighten her . Endeavour was beached on the Australian mainland for seven weeks to permit rudimentary repairs to her hull . Resuming her voyage , she limped into port in Batavia in October 1770 , her crew sworn to secrecy about the lands that they had visited . From Batavia Endeavour continued westward , rounded the Cape of Good Hope on 13 March 1771 and reached the English port of Dover on 12 July , having been at sea for nearly three years . The ship was largely forgotten after her epic Pacific voyage , spending the next three years hauling troops and cargo to and from the Falkland Islands .",

Cook joined the British merchant navy as a teenager and joined the Royal Navy in 1755 . He saw action in the Seven Years ' War and subsequently surveyed and mapped much of the entrance to the Saint Lawrence River during the siege of Quebec , which brought him to the attention of the Admiralty and Royal Society . This acclaim came at a crucial moment in his career and the direction of British overseas exploration , and led to his commission in 1766 as commander of HM Bark Endeavour for the first of three Pacific voyages . In these voyages , Cook sailed thousands of miles across largely uncharted areas of the globe . He mapped lands from New Zealand to Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean in greater detail and on a scale not previously charted by Western explorers . He surveyed and named features , and recorded islands and coastlines on European maps for the first time . He displayed a combination of seamanship , superior surveying and cartographic skills , physical courage , and an ability to lead men in adverse conditions . Cook was attacked and killed in 1779 during his third exploratory voyage in the Pacific while attempting to kidnap the Island of Hawaii 's monarch , Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu , in order to reclaim a cutter stolen from one of his ships .

In the book A Short Illustrated History of the Royal Aircraft Establishment , Bedford , author Arthur Pearcy writes : ( RAE Bedford is ) the finest research and development establishment outside the U.S.A . Starting in 1946 , construction work began to turn the wartime RAF airfield into what became known as the Royal Aeronautical Establishment , Bedford . The runway was extended in the post-war period to accommodate the Bristol Brabazon aircraft , which required a very long runway but which never went into production . A lot of the development for what became the Harrier was done here , one early version became known as the 'Flying Bedstead ' . Also Thurleigh had a catapult runway and it was here that the 'ski jump ' later fitted to some aircraft carriers was also developed . One local road was put in a cutting for a runway to be put above it , linking the Airfield site to the wind-tunnel site about a mile and a half away , although ultimately this was never carried out . The runway is some 10,500 ft long , and some 300 ft wide and as of June 2011 is used by a number of car storage companies . Naval Air Department and the BEA Helicopters Experimental Unit was here at some point . The airfield was decommissioned in February 1994 after a lengthy study determined that flight operations should be centralised at Boscombe Down in Wiltshire .

A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states .
