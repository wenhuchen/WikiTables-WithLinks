BBC Television covered the event and began a long broadcasting partnership with the BDO . Sid Waddell was the lead commentator on the tournament which he would cover for the BBC until 1994 . The championships became possible when Mike Watterson , a snooker promoter , came up with the idea whilst sat in a barber 's chair in 1977 . Imperial Tobacco , who already sponsored the World Snooker Championship with their Embassy brand , were also interested and with Watterson promoting the event Imperial also signed up to the darts version , which they were to sponsor for 25 years . The relationship only ended when the UK government decided to end tobacco companies right to sponsor sporting events . The tournament was held between 6 and 10 February . The tournament was held , for the only time , at the Heart of the Midlands Club in Nottingham . The BDO decided to move the event to Jollees Cabaret Club in Stoke-on-Trent for the following year .
