  "/wiki/Tuck_School_of_Business": "The Tuck School of Business ( also known as Tuck , and formally known as the Amos Tuck School of Administration and Finance ) is the graduate business school of Dartmouth College , an Ivy League research university in Hanover , New Hampshire . Founded in 1900 through a donation made by Dartmouth alumnus Edward Tuck , the Tuck School was the first institution in the world to offer a master 's degree in business administration . The Tuck School awards only one degree , the Master of Business Administration degree , through a full-time , residential program . The school does not offer an Executive MBA or a part-time program , believing that such programs , while lucrative , would dilute the focus of its full-time MBA program . Tuck does , however , offer an Advanced Management Program for executives , which spans either one or two weeks depending on the course . In addition , Tuck offers a 4-week , intensive summer program to liberal arts students seeking to build a foundation in core business concepts . Within Dartmouth , faculty from Tuck and The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice are partnering to offer a Master of Health Care Delivery Science degree from Dartmouth College . Moreover , Tuck partners with the Thayer School of Engineering to teach management courses through a Master of Engineering Management program offered by Thayer School of Engineering . Compared to other elite business schools , Tuck is known for its rural setting and small class size - each MBA class consists of about 280 students . As such , both factors , combined with Tuck 's commitment to the full-time MBA program attribute to its high giving rate among the 10,300 Tuck alumni across 73 countries . Almost 70% of all Tuck alumni regularly give to the school , the highest rate among business schools worldwide . The MBA program has held a top-10 ranking in multiple publications , including U.S. News & World Report , Bloomberg , The Economist , Forbes , Business Insider , and Vault .",

In allegorical or surrealist situations , Dean often depicted extremes of human behavior amid grim , decaying urban settings or barren landscapes . His artwork prompted Clifton Fadiman to comment , His pictures are trick mirrors in which we catch sight of those absurd fragments of ourselves that we never see in the smooth glass of habit . The nephew of sculptor Jacob Epstein , Dean graduated from Dartmouth College in 1931 , and studied at the National Academy of Design . He worked as a commercial illustrator , contributing to The New Yorker , Esquire , and other publications . His work for Life included illustrations of George Orwell 's 1984 for a Life article on Orwell . His first book , It 's a Long Way to Heaven ( Farrar and Rinehart , 1945 ) had an introduction by Philip Wylie .

  "/wiki/Daguerreotype": "The daguerreotype ( /d\u0259\u02c8\u0261\u025br ( i ) \u0259ta\u026ap , -r ( i ) o\u028a-/ ; French : daguerr\u00e9otype ) process , or daguerreotypy , was the first publicly available photographic process , widely used during the 1840s and 1850s . Invented by Louis-Jacques-Mand\u00e9 Daguerre and introduced worldwide in 1839 , daguerreotype was almost completely superseded by 1860 with new , less expensive processes yielding more readily viewable images . There was a revival of daguerreotypy in the late 20th century by a small number of photographers interested in making artistic use of early photographic processes . To make the image , a daguerrotypist would polish a sheet of silver-plated copper to a mirror finish , treat it with fumes that made its surface light sensitive , expose it in a camera for as long as was judged to be necessary , which could be as little as a few seconds for brightly sunlit subjects or much longer with less intense lighting ; make the resulting latent image on it visible by fuming it with mercury vapor ; remove its sensitivity to light by liquid chemical treatment , rinse and dry it , then seal the easily marred result behind glass in a protective enclosure . The image is on a mirror-like silver surface , normally kept under glass , and will appear either positive or negative , depending on the angle at which it is viewed , how it is lit and whether a light or dark background is being reflected in the metal . The darkest areas of the image are simply bare silver ; lighter areas have a microscopically fine light-scattering texture . The surface is very delicate , and even the lightest wiping can permanently scuff it . Some tarnish around the edges is normal . Several types of antique photographs , most often ambrotypes and tintypes , but sometimes even old prints on paper , are very commonly misidentified as daguerreotypes , especially if they are in the small , ornamented cases in which daguerreotypes made in the US and the UK were usually housed . The name daguerreotype correctly refers only to one very specific image type and medium , the product of a process that was in wide use only from the early 1840s to the late 1850s .",

Weston met Tommy Dorsey through Haymes and in 1936 became a member of Dorsey 's orchestra . Weston persuaded Dorsey to hire The Pied Pipers after hearing them in 1938 , and the group toured with the bandleader .

  "/wiki/Jonathan_Wolken": "Abraham Jonathan Wolken ( July 12 , 1949 - June 13 , 2010 ) was one of the original dancers and a co-founder of Pilobolus dance company in 1971 , which The New York Times in his obituary calls one of the most popular modern-dance companies in the world . Wolken served as one of the company 's three artistic directors . Wolken was born on July 12 , 1949 , in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , son of biophysicist Jerome Wolken . He attended Dartmouth College , where he earned a bachelor 's degree in Philosophy ( 1971 ) . While attending Dartmouth , he took a modern dance class taught by Alison Becker Chase . Together with Moses Pendleton , a fellow student in the Dartmouth dance class , Robby Barnett , and Lee Harris , Wolken formed the Pilobolus dance company , which was named for a fungus that shoots its spores as much as several feet away , having seen a demonstration from his father during his youth . Chase and Martha Clarke joined the group in 1973 ; and Michael Tracy was added the following year , replacing Lee Harris . Clarke left the group in 1978 and Pendleton in 1983 , each going off to form dance companies of their own . With almost no practical experience in dance , the group developed its own unique visual slapstick style . A review by dance critic Anna Kisselgoff of The Times in 1971 said the troupe 's enthusiasm suggest an interest in dance that can only be applauded , noting their amazing physical fearlessness , humor , inventiveness and unselfconsciousness , creating witty and theatrical shapes and kinetic gags using their body movements and groupings . This early performance evidenced the Pilobolus style that would last for decades that used the movements of the human body and interlinkings between members to create a form of kinetic art . Wolken ended his dance career several years after the troupe was formed but continued to choreograph performances including Pseudopodia ( 1973 ) , B'zyrk ( 2007 ) , and Razor : Mirror ( 2008 ) .",
