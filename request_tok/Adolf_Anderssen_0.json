  "/wiki/Marmaduke_Wyvill_(chess_player)": "Marmaduke Wyvill ( 22 December 1815 in Constable Burton - 25 June 1896 in Bournemouth ) was a leading English chess master and Liberal Party politician . He was among the world 's strongest players in the 1840s and 1850s . He was born the son of Marmaduke Wyvill of Constable Burton Hall ( 1791-1872 ) , MP for York . Regarded by Howard Staunton as 'one of the finest players in England ' he was primarily an enthusiastic amateur of chess , yet in his sole tournament appearance at London 1851 he took second prize behind Adolf Anderssen . Finishing ahead of Staunton , Elijah Williams , Bernhard Horwitz , and Jozsef Szen , he succumbed only to Anderssen in the final , by a score of 2\u00bd-4\u00bd . Long after he had retired from competitive play , he retained a great interest in the game and was known to have contributed to the organisation and funding of the 1883 London tournament . Through his 1845 marriage to Laura , daughter of Sir Charles Ibbetson , Bart. , he came into possession of Denton Hall . In 1847 Wyvill was elected as a Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Richmond , North Yorkshire . He retained the seat in 1861 , but lost it in 1865 , regaining it for a final time in 1866 . In a chess game , the Wyvill formation refers to a pawn formation in which White has no pawn on the b file , doubled pawns at c3 and c4 , and the d-pawn at d4 or d5 , such as may typically arise out of variations of the Nimzo-Indian and ( Winawer ) French Defences . The pawn at c4 may become a weakness , since it can not be supported by other pawns .",
  "/wiki/Elijah_Williams_(chess_player)": "Elijah Williams ( 7 October 1809 - 8 September 1854 ) was an eminent British chess player of the mid-19th century . He was the first president of the Clifton Chess Club , and publisher of a book of games from the Divan Club . His most notable result was at the 1851 London tournament , in which he defeated the celebrated British player Howard Staunton in the play-off for third place . He was accused by Staunton of taking an average of 2\u00bd hours per move during some matches , a strategy thought to cause opponents to lose their focus on the match . According to Staunton , following a particularly dilatory performance by Williams in the London 1851 tournament , a 20-minute per turn time limit was adopted for standard play the next year . However other sources contradict this viewpoint and indeed it was not uncommon for Staunton to attribute his losses to the intolerable dilatory play of his opponents . Staunton is quoted as remarking while playing against Williams , . Elijah , you 're not just supposed to sit there - you 're supposed to sit there and think ! In The Complete Chess Addict by Mike Fox and Richard James he was dubbed the Bristol Sloth due to his alleged extreme slowness . This sobriquet inspired a musical tune The Bristol Sloth by guitarist Leo Kottke ( who also applied the term 'sitzkrieg ' in describing Williams ' playing style ) . Williams died in London , a victim of the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak .",
  "/wiki/Howard_Staunton": "Howard Staunton ( 1810 - 22 June 1874 ) was an English chess master who is generally regarded as the world 's strongest player from 1843 to 1851 , largely as a result of his 1843 victory over Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant . He promoted a chess set of clearly distinguishable pieces of standardised shape - the Staunton pattern promulgated by Nathaniel Cooke - that is still the style required for competitions . He was the principal organiser of the first international chess tournament in 1851 , which made England the world 's leading chess centre and caused Adolf Anderssen to be recognised as the world 's strongest player . From 1840 onwards he became a leading chess commentator , and won matches against top players of the 1840s . In 1847 he entered a parallel career as a Shakespearean scholar . Ill health and his two writing careers led him to give up competitive chess after 1851 . In 1858 attempts were made to organise a match between Staunton and Paul Morphy , but they failed . It is often alleged that Staunton deliberately misled Morphy while trying to avoid the match , but it is also possible Staunton overestimated his chances of getting physically fit and of making time available for a match . Modern commentators consider Staunton 's understanding of positional play to have been far ahead of his contemporaries ' . Although not an all-out attacking player , he attacked when his preparations were complete . His chess articles and books were widely read and encouraged the development of chess in the United Kingdom , and his Chess-Player 's Handbook ( 1847 ) was a reference for decades . The chess openings the English Opening and Staunton Gambit were named for his advocacy of them .",

He often played in the Caf\u00e9 Worm of Pest , playing with any opponent for a stake of 20 Kreuzers . Very strong in the endgame , he was given the nickname of the Hungarian Philidor . He discovered and described the Szen position , in the endgame of rook and bishop against rook , as a drawing method for the weaker side ( see below ) . This work has stood up to subsequent analysis . From 1836 to 1839 , Szen travelled extensively throughout much of Europe , including France , Germany and England , playing chess wherever he went . In 1836 Sz\u00e9n played a match in Paris with Louis-Charles Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais , then considered the strongest player in the world , in which de La Bourdonnais gave him odds of pawn and two moves .

It is fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south , the Pennines to the north and east , and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation . The local authority for the city is Manchester City Council . The recorded history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort of Mamucium or Mancunium , which was established in about AD 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell . It is historically a part of Lancashire , although areas of Cheshire south of the River Mersey were incorporated in the 20th century . The first to be included , Wythenshawe , was added to the city in 1931 . Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township , but began to expand at an astonishing rate around the turn of the 19th century . Manchester 's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution , and resulted in it becoming the world 's first industrialised city . Manchester achieved city status in 1853 . The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894 , creating the Port of Manchester and directly linking the city to the Irish Sea , 36 miles ( 58 km ) to the west . Its fortune declined after the Second World War , owing to deindustrialisation , but the IRA bombing in 1996 led to extensive investment and regeneration .",

He was also a highly influential writer and chess theoretician . When discussing chess history from the 1850s onwards , commentators have debated whether Steinitz could be effectively considered the champion from an earlier time , perhaps as early as 1866 . Steinitz lost his title to Emanuel Lasker in 1894 , and lost a rematch in 1896-97 . Statistical rating systems give Steinitz a rather low ranking among world champions , mainly because he took several long breaks from competitive play . However , an analysis based on one of these rating systems shows that he was one of the most dominant players in the history of the game . Steinitz was unbeaten in match play for 32 years , from 1862 to 1894 . Although Steinitz became world number one by winning in the all-out attacking style that was common in the 1860s , he unveiled in 1873 a new positional style of play , and demonstrated that it was superior to the previous style . His new style was controversial and some even branded it as cowardly , but many of Steinitz 's games showed that it could also set up attacks as ferocious as those of the old school . Steinitz was also a prolific writer on chess , and defended his new ideas vigorously . The debate was so bitter and sometimes abusive that it became known as the Ink War . Steinitz was the target of anti-Semitic abuse , [ citation needed ] and moved to the United States in 1883 to escape this .",
