  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",

Founded following the federation of the colonies of Australia as the seat of government for the new nation , it is Australia 's largest inland city and the eighth-largest city overall . The city is located at the northern end of the Australian Capital Territory ; 280 km ( 170 mi ) south-west of Sydney and 660 km ( 410 mi ) north-east of Melbourne . On 1 January 1901 , federation of the colonies of Australia was achieved . Section 125 of the new Australian Constitution provided that land , situated in New South Wales and at least 100 miles ( 160 km ) from Sydney , would be ceded to the new federal government . Following discussion and exploration of various areas within New South Wales , the Seat of Government Act 1908 was passed in 1908 which specified a capital in the Yass-Canberra region . The land was transferred to the Commonwealth by New South Wales in 1911 , creating the Australian Capital Territory , two years prior to the capital city being founded and formally named as Canberra in 1913 . It is unusual among Australian cities , being an entirely planned city outside of any state , similar to Washington , D.C. in the United States or Bras\u00edlia in Brazil . Following an international contest for the city 's design , a blueprint by American architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin was selected and construction commenced in 1913 . The Griffins ' plan featured geometric motifs such as circles , hexagons and triangles , and was centred on axes aligned with significant topographical landmarks in the Australian Capital Territory . The city 's design was influenced by the garden city movement and incorporates significant areas of natural vegetation . As the seat of the government of Australia , Canberra is home to many important institutions of the federal government , national monuments and museums .",

New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 mi ) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres ( 600 mi ) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal , fungal , and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , and its most populous city is Auckland . Sometime between 1250 and 1300 , Polynesians settled in the islands and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture . In 1642 , Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight New Zealand . In 1840 , representatives of the United Kingdom and M\u0101ori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi , which declared British sovereignty over the islands .

In 1817 T\u012btore , and his junior relative , Tui , sailed to England . They visited Professor Samuel Lee at Cambridge University and assisted him in the preparation of a grammar and vocabulary of M\u0101ori . Kendall travelled to London in 1820 with Hongi Hika and Waikato ( a lower ranking Ng\u0101puhi chief ) during which time further work was done with Professor Lee , who gave phonetic spellings to a written form of the language , which resulted in a definitive orthography based on Northern usage .

However , in parts of Western , Gulf , Central , Oro Province and Milne Bay Provinces , the use of Tok Pisin has a shorter history , and is less universal , especially among older people . While it likely developed as a trade pidgin , Tok Pisin has become a distinct language in its own right . It is often referred to by Anglophones as New Guinea Pidgin or Pidgin English . [ citation needed ] Between five and six million people use Tok Pisin to some degree , although not all speak it well . Many now learn it as a first language , in particular the children of parents or grandparents who originally spoke different vernaculars ( for example , a mother from Madang and a father from Rabaul ) . Urban families in particular , and those of police and defence force members , often communicate among themselves in Tok Pisin , either never gaining fluency in a vernacular ( tok ples ) , or learning a vernacular as a second ( or third ) language , after Tok Pisin ( and possibly English ) . Perhaps one million people now use Tok Pisin as a primary language . Tok Pisin is slowly crowding out other languages of Papua New Guinea .",
  "/wiki/Port_Moresby": "The Motuan people of the area now known as Port Moresby traded their pots for sago , other food and canoe logs , sailing from Hanuabada and other villages built on stilts above the waters of the bay . Their language , Motu , was the basis of Hiri Motu , an official language of Papua New Guinea . It has been steadily in decline since the 1960s when Tok Pisin ( till then confined to the northern side of the former border between Papua , British New Guinea until 1905 , and New Guinea , which was German New Guinea until 1914 ) began to grow in popularity . The Hiri expeditions were large scale . As many as 20 multi-hulled canoes or lakatoi , crewed by some 600 men , carried about 20,000 clay pots on each journey . To the Motuans , the Hiri was an economic enterprise and it confirmed their tribal identity through its long and dangerous voyages . [ citation needed ]",

The capital city is Apia . The Lapita people discovered and settled the Samoan Islands around 3,500 years ago . They developed a Samoan language and Samoan cultural identity . Samoa is a unitary parliamentary democracy with eleven administrative divisions . The sovereign state is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations . Western Samoa was admitted to the United Nations on 15 December 1976 . The entire island group , which includes American Samoa , was called Navigator Islands by European explorers before the 20th century because of the Samoans ' seafaring skills . The country was governed by New Zealand until its independence in 1962 . In July 2017 , Va'aletoa Sualauvi II became the head of state , succeeding Tui \u0100tua Tupua Tamasese Efi .

The country 's capital , Honiara , is located on the island of Guadalcanal . The country takes its name from the Solomon Islands archipelago , which is a collection of Melanesian islands that also includes the North Solomon Islands ( part of Papua New Guinea ) , but excludes outlying islands , such as Rennell and Bellona , and the Santa Cruz Islands . In 1568 , the Spanish navigator \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a was the first European to visit them , naming them the Islas Salom\u00f3n . Britain defined its area of interest in the Solomon Islands archipelago in June 1893 , when Captain Gibson R.N. , of HMS Curacoa , declared the southern Solomon Islands a British protectorate . During World War II , the Solomon Islands campaign ( 1942-1945 ) saw fierce fighting between the United States and the Empire of Japan , such as in the Battle of Guadalcanal . The official name of the then British administration was changed from the British Solomon Islands Protectorate to the Solomon Islands in 1975 , and self-government was achieved the following year . Independence was obtained , and the name changed to just Solomon Islands ( without the definite article ) , in 1978 . At independence , Solomon Islands became a constitutional monarchy .

The island country lies east-northeast of the Santa Cruz Islands ( which belong to the Solomon Islands ) , southeast of Nauru , south of Kiribati , west of Tokelau , northwest of Samoa and Wallis and Futuna , and north of Fiji . It is composed of three reef islands and six true atolls spread out between the latitude of 5\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 south and longitude of 176\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 , west of the International Date Line . Tuvalu has a population of 11,192 ( 2017 census ) . The total land area of the islands of Tuvalu is 26 square kilometres ( 10 sq mi ) . The first inhabitants of Tuvalu were Polynesians . The origins of the people of Tuvalu are addressed in the theories regarding migration into the Pacific that began about three thousand years ago . During pre-European-contact times there was frequent canoe voyaging between the islands as Polynesian navigation skills are recognised to have allowed deliberate journeys on double-hull sailing canoes or outrigger canoes . The pattern of settlement that is believed to have occurred is that the Polynesians spread out from Samoa and Tonga into the Tuvaluan atolls , with Tuvalu providing a stepping stone to further migration into the Polynesian outliers in Melanesia and Micronesia . In 1568 , Spanish navigator \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a was the first European to sail through the archipelago , sighting the island of Nui during his expedition in search of Terra Australis . The island of Funafuti was named Ellice 's Island in 1819 ; the name Ellice was applied to all of the nine islands after the work of English hydrographer Alexander George Findlay . The Ellice Islands came into Great Britain 's sphere of influence in the late 19th century , as the result of a treaty between Great Britain and Germany relating to the demarcation of the spheres of influence in the Pacific Ocean .",

Vanuatu was first inhabited by Melanesian people . The first Europeans to visit the islands were a Spanish expedition led by Portuguese navigator Fernandes de Queir\u00f3s , who arrived on the largest island , Esp\u00edritu Santo , in 1606 . Since the Portuguese and Spanish monarchies had been unified under the king of Spain in 1580 ( following the vacancy of the Portuguese throne , which lasted for sixty years , until 1640 , when the Portuguese monarchy was restored ) , Queir\u00f3s claimed the archipelago for Spain , as part of the colonial Spanish East Indies , and named it La Austrialia del Esp\u00edritu Santo . In the 1880s , France and the United Kingdom claimed parts of the archipelago , and in 1906 , they agreed on a framework for jointly managing the archipelago as the New Hebrides through an Anglo-French condominium . An independence movement arose in the 1970s , and the Republic of Vanuatu was founded in 1980 .

It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire , as did all Romance languages . French evolved from Gallo-Romance , the spoken Latin in Gaul , and more specifically in Northern Gaul . Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders . Today , owing to France 's past overseas expansion , there are numerous French-based creole languages , most notably Haitian Creole . A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French . French is an official language in 29 countries across multiple continents , most of which are members of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie ( OIF ) , the community of 84 countries which share the official use or teaching of French . It is spoken as a first language ( in descending order of the number of speakers ) in France , the Canadian provinces of Quebec , Ontario and New Brunswick as well as other Francophone regions , Belgium ( Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region ) , western Switzerland ( cantons of Bern , Fribourg , Geneva , Jura , Neuch\u00e2tel , Vaud , Valais ) , Monaco , partly in Luxembourg , the states of Louisiana , Maine , New Hampshire and Vermont in the United States , and in northwestern Italy ( region of Aosta Valley ) , and by various communities elsewhere .
