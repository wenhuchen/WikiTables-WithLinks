  "/wiki/Manhattan_Project": "The Manhattan Project was a research and development undertaking during World War II that produced the first nuclear weapons . It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada . From 1942 to 1946 , the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . Nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory that designed the actual bombs . The Army component of the project was designated the Manhattan District ; Manhattan gradually superseded the official codename , Development of Substitute Materials , for the entire project . Along the way , the project absorbed its earlier British counterpart , Tube Alloys . The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939 , but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US $ 2 billion ( about $ 23 billion in 2018 dollars ) . Over 90% of the cost was for building factories and to produce fissile material , with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons . Research and production took place at more than 30 sites across the United States , the United Kingdom , and Canada . Two types of atomic bombs were developed concurrently during the war : a relatively simple gun-type fission weapon and a more complex implosion-type nuclear weapon . The Thin Man gun-type design proved impractical to use with plutonium , and therefore a simpler gun-type called Little Boy was developed that used uranium-235 , an isotope that makes up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium . Chemically identical to the most common isotope , uranium-238 , and with almost the same mass , it proved difficult to separate the two .",
