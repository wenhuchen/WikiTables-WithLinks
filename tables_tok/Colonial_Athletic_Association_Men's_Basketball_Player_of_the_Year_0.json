  "intro": "The Colonial Athletic Association Men's Basketball Player of the Year is a basketball award given to the Colonial Athletic Association's most outstanding player. The award was first given following the 1982-83 season, when the conference was known as the ECAC South basketball league. In 1985, the conference expanded to offer more sports, and became the Colonial Athletic Association. The first award, the only tie, was given to Dan Ruland of James Madison and Carlos Yates of George Mason. Two different players have won the award three times. David Robinson of Navy won in 1984, 1985, and 1986. George Evans won in 1999, 2000, and 2001 while playing for George Mason. Evans' first award in 1999 was as a 28-year-old sophomore - he had served seven years in the United States Army, seeing combat in Somalia, Bosnia, and Desert Storm. Steve Hood of James Madison, Odell Hodge of Old Dominion, Brett Blizzard of UNC Wilmington, Eric Maynor of VCU, Charles Jenkins of Hofstra, Jerrelle Benimon of Towson and Justin Wright-Foreman of Hofstra have each won the award twice. Three of the four schools with the most winners are no longer in the conference. George Mason (six winners), left for the Atlantic 10 in 2013. Hofstra is the current CAA member with the most winners (also six), while Old Dominion and VCU have each had four winners."
