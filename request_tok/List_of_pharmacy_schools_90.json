The city is situated on the southern edge of Gda\u0144sk Bay on the Baltic Sea , in a conurbation with the city of Gdynia , the resort town of Sopot , and suburban communities ; these form a metropolitan area called the Tricity ( Tr\u00f3jmiasto ) , with a population approaching 1.4 million .

Together with the nearby port of Gdynia , Gda\u0144sk is also a notable industrial centre .

In the early-modern age , Gda\u0144sk was a royal city of Poland . It was considered the wealthiest and the largest city of Poland , before the 18th century rapid growth of Warsaw . In the late Middle Ages it was an important seaport and shipbuilding town and , in the 14th and 15th centuries , a member of the Hanseatic League . In the interwar period , owing to its multi-ethnic make-up and history , Gda\u0144sk lay in a disputed region between Poland and Germany , which became known as the Polish Corridor . The city 's ambiguous political status was exploited , furthering tension between the two countries , which would ultimately culminate in the Invasion of Poland and the first clash of the Second World War just outside the city limits , followed by the flight and expulsion of the majority of the previous population in 1945 .",

Lublin is the largest Polish city east of the Vistula River and is about 170 km ( 106 mi ) to the southeast of Warsaw by road . One of the events that greatly contributed to the city 's development was the Polish-Lithuanian Union of Krewo in 1385 . Lublin thrived as a centre of trade and commerce due to its strategic location on the route between Vilnius and Krak\u00f3w ; the inhabitants had the privilege of free trade in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania . The Lublin Parliament session of 1569 led to the creation of a real union between the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania , thus creating the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth . Lublin witnessed the early stages of Reformation in the 16th century . A Calvinist congregation was founded and groups of radical Arians appeared in the city , making it an important global centre of Arianism . At the turn of the century , Lublin was recognized for hosting a number of outstanding poets , writers , and historians of the epoch . Until the partitions at the end of the 18th century , Lublin was a royal city of the Crown Kingdom of Poland . Its delegates and nobles had the right to participate in the royal election . In 1578 , Lublin was chosen as the seat of the Crown Tribunal , the highest appeal court in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , and for centuries , the city has been flourishing as a centre of culture and higher learning , with Krak\u00f3w , Warsaw , Pozna\u0144 , and Lw\u00f3w .",

It is the capital of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship , and is located approximately 120 kilometres ( 75 mi ) south-west of Warsaw . The city 's coat of arms is an example of canting , as it depicts a boat ( \u0142\u00f3d\u017a in Polish ) , which alludes to the city 's name . \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was once a small settlement that first appeared in written records in around 1332 . In the early 15th century it was granted city rights , but remained a rather small and insubstantial town . It was the property of Kuyavian bishops and clergy until the end of the 18th century , when \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was annexed by Prussia as a result of the second partition of Poland . Following the collapse of the independent Duchy of Warsaw , the city became part of Congress Poland , a client state of the Russian Empire . It was then that \u0141\u00f3d\u017a experienced rapid growth in the cloth industry and in population due to the inflow of migrants , most notably Germans and Jews . Ever since the industrialization of the area , the city has struggled with many difficulties such as multinationalism and social inequality , which were vividly documented in the novel The Promised Land written by Polish Nobel Prize-winning author W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont .

Throughout the mid-18th century , Katowice had developed into a village upon the discovery of rich coal reserves in the area . In 1742 the First Silesian War transferred Upper Silesia , including Katowice , to Prussia . Subsequently , from the second half of the 18th century , many German or Prussian craftsmen , merchants and artists began to settle in the region , which had been inhabited mostly by Poles over the past hundreds of years . Simultaneously Silesia experienced the influx of the first Jewish settlers . In the first half of the 19th century , intensive industrialization transformed local mills and farms into industrial steelworks , mines , foundries and artisan workshops . This also contributed to the establishment of companies and eventual rapid growth of the city . At the same time , Katowice became linked to the railway system with the first train arriving at the main station in 1847 . The outbreak of World War I was favourable for Katowice due to the prospering steel industry .

Bombed at the start of the German invasion in 1939 , the city withstood a siege for which it was later awarded Poland 's highest military decoration for heroism , the Virtuti Militari . Deportations of the Jewish population to concentration camps led to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943 and the destruction of the Ghetto after a month of combat . A general Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944 led to even greater devastation and systematic razing by the Germans in advance of the Vistula-Oder Offensive .
