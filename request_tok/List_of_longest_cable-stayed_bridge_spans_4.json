The city 's prominence began to decline in the early Middle Ages , partly due to the loss of independence after the union of the Leonese kingdom with the Crown of Castile , consolidated in 1301 . After a period of stagnation during the early modern age , it was one of the first cities to hold an uprising in the Spanish War of Independence , and some years later , in 1833 acquired the status of provincial capital .

Le\u00f3n 's historical and architectural heritage , as well as the numerous festivals hosted throughout the year ( particularly noteworthy are the Easter processions ) and its location on the French Way of the Camino de Santiago , which is ranked as a UNESCO World Heritage Site , make it a destination of both domestic and international tourism . Some of the city 's most prominent historical buildings are the Cathedral , one of the finest examples of French-style classic Gothic architecture in Spain , the Basilica of San Isidoro , one of the most important Romanesque churches in Spain and resting place of Le\u00f3n 's medieval monarchs , the Monastery of San Marcos , an example of plateresque and Renaissance Spanish architecture , and the Casa Botines , a Modernist creation of the architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed .",
