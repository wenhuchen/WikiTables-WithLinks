  "/wiki/Kettle_(landform)": "A kettle ( kettle hole , pothole ) is a depression/hole in an outwash plain formed by retreating glaciers or draining floodwaters . The kettles are formed as a result of blocks of dead ice left behind by retreating glaciers , which become surrounded by sediment deposited by meltwater streams as there is increased friction . The ice becomes buried in the sediment and when the ice melts , a depression is left called a kettle hole , creating a dimpled appearance on the outwash plain . Lakes often fill these kettles ; these are called kettle hole lakes . Another source is the sudden drainage of an ice-dammed lake . When the block melts , the hole it leaves behind is a kettle . As the ice melts , ramparts can form around the edge of the kettle hole . The lakes that fill these holes are seldom more than 10 m ( 33 ft ) deep and eventually become filled with sediment . In acid conditions , a kettle bog may form but in alkaline conditions , it will be kettle peatland . [ clarification needed ]",
