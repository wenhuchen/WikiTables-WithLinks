It is the official language of Serbia , co-official in the territory of Kosovo , and one of the three official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina . In addition , it is a recognized minority language in Montenegro , where it is spoken by the relative majority of the population , as well as in Croatia , North Macedonia , Romania , Hungary , Slovakia , and the Czech Republic . Standard Serbian is based on the most widespread dialect of Serbo-Croatian , Shtokavian ( more specifically on the dialects of \u0160umadija-Vojvodina and Eastern Herzegovina ) , which is also the basis of standard Croatian , Bosnian , and Montenegrin varieties and therefore the Declaration on the Common Language of Croats , Bosniaks , Serbs and Montenegrins was issued in 2017 . The other dialect spoken by Serbs is Torlakian in southeastern Serbia , which is transitional to Macedonian and Bulgarian . Serbian is practically the only European standard language whose speakers are fully functionally digraphic , using both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets . The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet was devised in 1814 by Serbian linguist Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107 , who created it based on phonemic principles . The Serbian Latin alphabet was designed by Croatian linguist Ljudevit Gaj in 1830 .",

  "/wiki/Slavic_languages": "The Slavic languages ( also called Slavonic languages ) are the Indo-European languages spoken by the Slavic peoples . They are thought to descend from a proto-language called Proto-Slavic , spoken during the Early Middle Ages , which in turn is thought to have descended from the earlier Proto-Balto-Slavic language , linking the Slavic languages to the Baltic languages in a Balto-Slavic group within the Indo-European family . The Slavic languages are conventionally ( that is , also on the basis of extralinguistic features ) divided intro three subgroups : East , West , and South , which together constitute more than 20 languages . Of these , 10 have at least one million speakers and official status as the national languages of the countries in which they are predominantly spoken : Russian , Belarusian and Ukrainian ( of the East group ) , Polish , Czech and Slovak ( of the West group ) and Bulgarian and Macedonian ( eastern dialects of the South group ) , and Serbo-Croatian and Slovene ( western dialects of the South group ) . The current geographic distribution of natively spoken Slavic languages covers Eastern Europe , the Balkans , Central Europe and all of the territory of Russia , which includes northern and north-central Asia . Furthermore , the diasporas of many Slavic peoples have established isolated minorities of speakers of their languages all over the world . The number of speakers of all Slavic languages together was estimated to be 315 million at the turn of the twenty-first century . Despite the large extent , the individual Slavic languages are considerably less differentiated than Germanic and Romance languages .",

It is also referred to as Paleo-Slavic ( Paleoslavic ) or Palaeo-Slavic ( Palaeoslavic ) , not to be confused with Proto-Slavic . It is often abbreviated to OCS . Historians credit the 9th-century Byzantine missionaries Saints Cyril and Methodius with standardizing the language and using it in translating the Bible and other Ancient Greek ecclesiastical texts as part of the Christianization of the Slavs . It is thought to have been based primarily on the dialect of the 9th-century Byzantine Slavs living in the Province of Thessalonica ( in present-day Greece ) . Old Church Slavonic played an important role in the history of the Slavic languages and served as a basis and model for later Church Slavonic traditions , and some Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches use this later Church Slavonic as a liturgical language to this day . As the oldest attested Slavic language , OCS provides important evidence for the features of Proto-Slavic , the reconstructed common ancestor of all Slavic languages .",

From the early 6th century they spread to inhabit most of Central , Eastern and Southeastern Europe . Today , there is a large Slavic diaspora throughout North America , particularly in the United States and Canada as a result of immigration .

It has the longest documented history of any living Indo-European language , spanning at least 3,500 years of written records . Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the major part of its history ; other systems , such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary , were used previously . The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin , Cyrillic , Armenian , Coptic , Gothic , and many other writing systems . The Greek language holds an important place in the history of the Western world and Christianity ; the canon of ancient Greek literature includes works in the Western canon such as the epic poems Iliad and Odyssey . Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science , especially astronomy , mathematics and logic and Western philosophy , such as the Platonic dialogues and the works of Aristotle , are composed ; the New Testament of the Christian Bible was written in Koin\u00e9 Greek . Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world , the study of the Greek texts and society of antiquity constitutes the discipline of Classics . During antiquity , Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world , West Asia and many places beyond . It would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire and develop into Medieval Greek . In its modern form , Greek is the official language in two countries , Greece and Cyprus , a recognised minority language in seven other countries , and is one of the 24 official languages of the European Union . The language is spoken by at least 13.2 million people today in Greece , Cyprus , Italy , Albania , and Turkey and by the Greek diaspora .
