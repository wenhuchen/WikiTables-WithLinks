  "/wiki/Church_of_St._Olaf,_Jomala": "The Church of St. Olaf is a medieval stone church in Jomala , \u00c5land Islands . It belongs to the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland . Dating from about 1260 to 1280 , it is possibly the oldest Christian church in Finland , and was extended in the 19th century . It is constructed of local red granite and limestone . The church is dedicated to King Olaf II of Norway , patron saint of the \u00c5land Islands and Jomala . The coloured wall paintings from the 1280s on the Western gable represent scenes from the parable of the Prodigal Son . Considerations to expand the church began in the 17th century and a plan from 1809 , while under Swedish rule , was not acted on . From 1844 , under the Russian Empire , the extensions were made . In 1968 , a new stained-glass window was donated to the church by the American artist Ture Bengtz , whose ancestors were from Jomala .",
