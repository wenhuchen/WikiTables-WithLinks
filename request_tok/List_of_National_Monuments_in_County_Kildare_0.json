It was constructed in the late 1630s when Ireland was under the reign of Charles I ( 1625-1649 ) . At the time it was one of the largest buildings in Ireland , and the first to be constructed of red brick : the plans provided for a pavement and columns of Kilkenny marble . Jigginstown Castle was built on the periphery of an area known as The Pale , which was on the outskirts of Dublin . It was an area which was guarded on its outskirts by the English plantation settlers to protect valuables and livestock . The castle has also been previously known as Siggingstown Castle . Thomas Wentworth , Earl of Strafford and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in the 1630s , was responsible for the construction . His intention was for the castle to be a place where the King could reside on royal visits to Ireland . The downfall and execution for treason of Lord Strafford in 1641 meant that the house was never completed , and it was largely destroyed during the civil strife of the 1640s , although , according to Strafford 's biographer Veronica Wedgwood , the foundations were still visible in the 1950s . The basement and castle 's ground floor still stand to this day .",
