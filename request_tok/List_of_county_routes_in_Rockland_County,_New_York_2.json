  "/wiki/US_202_(NY)": "U.S. Route 202 ( US 202 ) is a part of the U.S. Highway System that runs from New Castle , Delaware , to Bangor , Maine . In the U.S. state of New York , US 202 extends 55.57 miles ( 89.43 km ) from the New Jersey state line near Suffern to the Connecticut state line east of Brewster . While most of US 202 is signed north-south , the portion within New York is signed east-west . It drifts north slowly as it crosses southern New York . US 202 is the only road to cross New York between New Jersey and Connecticut and not pass through New York City on the way . As it does in other states , Route 202 serves mainly as a local road in suburban and exurban communities along the outskirts of the metropolitan area , mostly two lanes with the exception of some four-lane sections and a brief concurrency onto an expressway in Peekskill . Its course along the Hudson River takes it first north up the west side , over the historic Bear Mountain Bridge , then south along the east side . It takes in many scenic areas , such as the Ramapo Mountains and Hudson Highlands , and two New York City reservoirs . Its circuitous path across the state puts it on many concurrencies - only 14.5 miles ( 23.3 km ) , or 26% , of Route 202 's mileage in New York is signed as US 202 alone . Among the roads it joins are three U.S. highways and two state routes . It forms four three-route conurrencies , including the only such grouping of three U.S. routes in the state , again in Peekskill .",

  "/wiki/New_Jersey": "New Jersey is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the Northeastern United States . It is bordered on the north and east by the state of New York ; on the east , southeast , and south by the Atlantic Ocean ; on the west by the Delaware River and Pennsylvania ; and on the southwest by the Delaware Bay and the State of Delaware . New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state by area but the 11th-most populous , with 9 million residents as of 2017 and an area of 8,722.58 square miles , making it the most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states , with its biggest city being Newark . New Jersey lies completely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia . New Jersey was the second-wealthiest U.S. state by median household income as of 2017 . New Jersey was inhabited by Native Americans for more than 2,800 years , with historical tribes such as the Lenape along the coast . In the early 17th century , the Dutch and the Swedes founded the first European settlements in the state . The English later seized control of the region , naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest of the Channel Islands , Jersey , and granting it as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley , 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton . New Jersey was the site of several important battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century . In the 19th century , factories in the cities Camden , Paterson , Newark , Trenton , Jersey City , and Elizabeth ( known as the Big Six ) , helped drive the Industrial Revolution . New Jersey 's geographic location at the center of the Northeast megalopolis , between Boston and New York City to the northeast , and Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Washington , D.C. , to the southwest , fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century . At the turn of the 21st century , this suburbanization began reverting with the consolidation of New Jersey 's culturally diverse populace toward more urban settings within the state , with towns home to commuter rail stations outpacing the population growth of more automobile-oriented suburbs since 2008 .",
