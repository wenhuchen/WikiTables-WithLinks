  "/wiki/Indian_revolt": "The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major , but ultimately unsuccessful , uprising in India in 1857-58 against the rule of the British East India Company , which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown . The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company 's army in the garrison town of Meerut , 40 mi ( 64 km ) northeast of Delhi ( now Old Delhi ) . It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India , [ a ] [ b ] though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east . [ c ] The rebellion posed a considerable threat to British power in that region , [ d ] and was contained only with the rebels ' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858 . On 1 November 1858 , the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder , though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859 . Its name is contested , variously described as the Sepoy Mutiny , the Indian Mutiny , the Great Rebellion , the Revolt of 1857 , the Indian Insurrection , and the First War of Independence . [ e ] The Indian rebellion was fed by resentments born of diverse perceptions , including invasive British-style social reforms , harsh land taxes , summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes , as well as scepticism about the improvements brought about by British rule . [ f ] Many Indians rose against the British ; however , many also fought for the British , and the majority remained seemingly compliant to British rule . [ g ] Violence , which sometimes betrayed exceptional cruelty , was inflicted on both sides , on British officers , and civilians , including women and children , by the rebels , and on the rebels , and their supporters , including sometimes entire villages , by British reprisals ; the cities of Delhi and Lucknow were laid waste in the fighting and the British retaliation . [ h ] After the outbreak of the mutiny in Meerut , the rebels quickly reached Delhi , whose 81-year-old Mughal ruler , Bahadur Shah Zafar , was declared the Emperor of Hindustan . Soon , the rebels had captured large tracts of the North-Western Provinces and Awadh ( Oudh ) . The East India Company 's response came rapidly as well .",

Delhi 's urban area is now considered to extend beyond the NCT boundaries , and include the neighbouring satellite cities of Ghaziabad , Faridabad , Gurgaon and Noida in an area now called National Capital Region ( NCR ) and had an estimated 2016 population of over 26 million people , making it the world 's second-largest urban area according to the United Nations . As of 2016 [ update ] , recent estimates of the metro economy of its urban area have ranked Delhi either the most or second-most productive metro area of India . Delhi is the second-wealthiest city in India after Mumbai and is home to 18 billionaires and 23,000 millionaires .

In the Indian Ocean , India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives ; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia . Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",

The population is 32 million , mostly composed of ethnic Pashtuns , Tajiks , Hazaras and Uzbeks . Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the Middle Paleolithic Era , and the country 's strategic location along the Silk Road connected it to the cultures of the Middle East and other parts of Asia . The land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns , including those by Alexander the Great , Mauryas , Muslim Arabs , Mongols , British , Soviets , and by the United States with allied countries . The land also served as the source from which the Kushans , Hephthalites , Samanids , Saffarids , Ghaznavids , Ghorids , Khaljis , Mughals , Hotaks , Durranis , and others have risen to form major empires . The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan began with the Hotak and Durrani dynasties in the 18th century . In the late 19th century , Afghanistan became a buffer state in the Great Game between British India and the Russian Empire . Its border with British India , the Durand Line , was formed in 1893 but it is not recognized by the Afghan government and it has led to strained relations with Pakistan since the latter 's independence in 1947 .

When Mortimer Durand , Secretary for State of India was appointed administrator of the Gilgit Agency , he opened up the region by building roads , telegraph , and mail systems while maintaining a dialogue with the Mir of Gilgit . He intended to improve the road from Kashmir through Hunza and Nagar and up to the frontier with Russia . The Mirs of Nagar and Hunza saw this as a threat to their natural advantage of remoteness . In 1890 , Durant reinforced Chalt Fort that was near the border due to the rumor that Nagar and Hunza fighters were about to attack it , and continued redeveloping the road up to the fort . In May 1891 , Nagar and Hunza sent a warning to Durant not to continue work on the road to the fort and to vacate the fort , which was on the Gilgit side of the border , else they would regard it as an act of war . Durant reinforced the fort and accelerated the road construction to it , causing Nagar and Hunza to see this as an escalation and so they stopped mail from the British Resident in Chinese Turkmenistan through their territory .
