  "/wiki/Symbol": "A symbol is a mark , sign or word that indicates , signifies , or is understood as representing an idea , object , or relationship . Symbols allow people to go beyond what is known or seen by creating linkages between otherwise very different concepts and experiences . All communication ( and data processing ) is achieved through the use of symbols . Symbols take the form of words , sounds , gestures , ideas or visual images and are used to convey other ideas and beliefs . For example , a red octagon may be a symbol for STOP . On a map , a blue line might represent a river . Numerals are symbols for numbers . Alphabetic letters may be symbols for sounds . Personal names are symbols representing individuals . A red rose may symbolize love and compassion . The variable ' x ' , in a mathematical equation , may symbolize the position of a particle in space . The academic study of symbols is semiotics .",
  "/wiki/Physical_quantity": "A physical quantity is a property of a material or system that can be quantified by measurement . A physical quantity can be expressed as the combination of a magnitude and a unit . For example , the physical quantity mass can be quantified as n kg where n is magnitude and kg is the unit .",
  "/wiki/SI_base_unit": "The SI base units are the standard units of measurement chosen for the seven base quantities chosen by the International System of Quantities : they are notably a basic set from which all other SI units can be derived . The units and their physical quantities are the second for time , the metre for measurement of length , the kilogram for mass , the ampere for electric current , the kelvin for temperature , the mole for amount of substance , and the candela for luminous intensity . The SI base units are a fundamental part of modern metrology , and thus part of the foundation of modern science and technology . The SI base units form a set of mutually independent dimensions as required by dimensional analysis commonly employed in science and technology . [ citation needed ] The names and symbols of SI base units are written in lowercase , except the symbols of those named after a person , which are written with an initial capital letter . For example , the metre ( US English : meter ) has the symbol m , but the kelvin has symbol K , because it is named after Lord Kelvin and the ampere with symbol A is named after Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re . A number of other units , such as the litre ( US English : liter ) , astronomical unit and electronvolt , are not formally part of the SI , but are accepted for use with SI .",
  "/wiki/Hertz": "The hertz ( symbol : Hz ) is the derived unit of frequency in the International System of Units ( SI ) and is defined as one cycle per second . It is named after Heinrich Rudolf Hertz , the first person to provide conclusive proof of the existence of electromagnetic waves . Hertz are commonly expressed in multiples : kilohertz ( 103 Hz , kHz ) , megahertz ( 106 Hz , MHz ) , gigahertz ( 109 Hz , GHz ) , terahertz ( 1012 Hz , THz ) , petahertz ( 1015 Hz , PHz ) , exahertz ( 1018 Hz , EHz ) , and zettahertz ( 1021 Hz , ZHz ) . Some of the unit 's most common uses are in the description of sine waves and musical tones , particularly those used in radio- and audio-related applications . It is also used to describe the clock speeds at which computers and other electronics are driven . The units are sometimes also used as a representation of energy , via the photon energy equation ( E=h\u03bd ) , with one hertz equivalent to h joules .",
  "/wiki/Frequency": "Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time . It is also referred to as temporal frequency , which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency . The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event , so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency . For example : if a newborn baby 's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute , its period , T , - the time interval between beats - is half a second ( 60 seconds divided by 120 beats ) . Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena , such as mechanical vibrations , audio signals ( sound ) , radio waves , and light .",
  "/wiki/Radian": "The radian is the SI unit for measuring angles , and is the standard unit of angular measure used in many areas of mathematics . The length of an arc of a unit circle is numerically equal to the measurement in radians of the angle that it subtends ; one radian is just under 57.3 degrees ( expansion at OEIS : A072097 ) . The unit was formerly an SI supplementary unit , but this category was abolished in 1995 and the radian is now considered an SI derived unit . The symbol rad can be used to represent the radian ( for example , an angle of 1.3 radians would be written as 1.3 rad ) , but this is often omitted , especially in mathematical writing .",
  "/wiki/Angle": "In plane geometry , an angle is the figure formed by two rays , called the sides of the angle , sharing a common endpoint , called the vertex of the angle . Angles formed by two rays lie in a plane , but this plane does not have to be a Euclidean plane . Angles are also formed by the intersection of two planes in Euclidean and other spaces . These are called dihedral angles . Angles formed by the intersection of two curves in a plane are defined as the angle determined by the tangent rays at the point of intersection . Similar statements hold in space , for example , the spherical angle formed by two great circles on a sphere is the dihedral angle between the planes determined by the great circles . Angle is also used to designate the measure of an angle or of a rotation . This measure is the ratio of the length of a circular arc to its radius . In the case of a geometric angle , the arc is centered at the vertex and delimited by the sides . In the case of a rotation , the arc is centered at the center of the rotation and delimited by any other point and its image by the rotation . The word angle comes from the Latin word angulus , meaning corner ; cognate words are the Greek \u1f00\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 ( ankyl\u03bfs ) , meaning crooked , curved , and the English word ankle . Both are connected with the Proto-Indo-European root *ank- , meaning to bend or bow .",
  "/wiki/Steradian": "The steradian ( symbol : sr ) or square radian is the SI unit of solid angle . It is used in three-dimensional geometry , and is analogous to the radian , which quantifies planar angles . Whereas an angle in radians , projected onto a circle , gives a length on the circumference , a solid angle in steradians , projected onto a sphere , gives an area on the surface . The name is derived from the Greek \u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 stereos 'solid ' + radian . The steradian , like the radian , is a dimensionless unit , the quotient of the area subtended and the square of its distance from the center . Both the numerator and denominator of this ratio have dimension length squared ( i.e . L2/L2 = 1 , dimensionless ) . It is useful , however , to distinguish between dimensionless quantities of a different nature , so the symbol sr is used to indicate a solid angle . For example , radiant intensity can be measured in watts per steradian ( W\u22c5sr\u22121 ) . The steradian was formerly an SI supplementary unit , but this category was abolished in 1995 and the steradian is now considered an SI derived unit .",
  "/wiki/Solid_angle": "In geometry , a solid angle ( symbol : \u03a9 ) is a measure of the amount of the field of view from some particular point that a given object covers . That is , it is a measure of how large the object appears to an observer looking from that point . The point from which the object is viewed is called the apex of the solid angle , and the object is said to subtend its solid angle from that point . In the International System of Units ( SI ) , a solid angle is expressed in a dimensionless unit called a steradian ( symbol : sr ) . One steradian corresponds to one unit of area on the unit sphere surrounding the apex , so an object that blocks all rays from the apex would cover a number of steradians equal to the total surface area of the unit sphere , 4 \u03c0 { \\displaystyle 4\\pi } . Solid angles can also be measured in squares of angular measures such as degrees , minutes , and seconds . A small object nearby may subtend the same solid angle as a larger object farther away . For example , although the Moon is much smaller than the Sun , it is also much closer to Earth . Indeed , as viewed from any point on Earth , both objects have approximately the same solid angle as well as apparent size . This is evident during a solar eclipse .",
  "/wiki/Newton_(unit)": "The newton ( symbol : N ) is the International System of Units ( SI ) derived unit of force . It is named after Isaac Newton in recognition of his work on classical mechanics , specifically Newton 's second law of motion . See below for the conversion factors .",
  "/wiki/Force": "In physics , a force is any interaction that , when unopposed , will change the motion of an object . A force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity ( which includes to begin moving from a state of rest ) , i.e. , to accelerate . Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull . A force has both magnitude and direction , making it a vector quantity . It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F. The original form of Newton 's second law states that the net force acting upon an object is equal to the rate at which its momentum changes with time . If the mass of the object is constant , this law implies that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on the object , is in the direction of the net force , and is inversely proportional to the mass of the object . Concepts related to force include : thrust , which increases the velocity of an object ; drag , which decreases the velocity of an object ; and torque , which produces changes in rotational speed of an object . In an extended body , each part usually applies forces on the adjacent parts ; the distribution of such forces through the body is the internal mechanical stress . Such internal mechanical stresses cause no acceleration of that body as the forces balance one another . Pressure , the distribution of many small forces applied over an area of a body , is a simple type of stress that if unbalanced can cause the body to accelerate . Stress usually causes deformation of solid materials , or flow in fluids .",
  "/wiki/Weight": "In science and engineering , the weight of an object is related to the force acting on the object , either due to gravity or to a reaction force that holds it in place . Some standard textbooks define weight as a vector quantity , the gravitational force acting on the object . Others define weight as a scalar quantity , the magnitude of the gravitational force . Others define it as the magnitude of the reaction force exerted on a body by mechanisms that keep it in place : the weight is the quantity that is measured by , for example , a spring scale . Thus , in a state of free fall , the weight would be zero . In this sense of weight , terrestrial objects can be weightless : ignoring air resistance , the famous apple falling from the tree , on its way to meet the ground near Isaac Newton , would be weightless . The unit of measurement for weight is that of force , which in the International System of Units ( SI ) is the newton . For example , an object with a mass of one kilogram has a weight of about 9.8 newtons on the surface of the Earth , and about one-sixth as much on the Moon . Although weight and mass are scientifically distinct quantities , the terms are often confused with each other in everyday use ( i.e . comparing and converting force weight in pounds to mass in kilograms and vice versa ) . Further complications in elucidating the various concepts of weight have to do with the theory of relativity according to which gravity is modelled as a consequence of the curvature of spacetime . In the teaching community , a considerable debate has existed for over half a century on how to define weight for their students .",
  "/wiki/Pascal_(unit)": "The pascal ( symbol : Pa ) is the SI derived unit of pressure used to quantify internal pressure , stress , Young 's modulus and ultimate tensile strength . The unit , named after Blaise Pascal , is defined as one newton per square metre . The unit of measurement called standard atmosphere ( atm ) is defined as 101325 Pa. Common multiple units of the pascal are the hectopascal ( 1 hPa = 100 Pa ) which is equal to one millibar , and the kilopascal ( 1 kPa = 1000 Pa ) which is equal to one centibar . Meteorological forecasts typically report atmospheric pressure in hectopascals per the recommendation of the World Meteorological Organization . Forecasts in the United States typically use millibars , in Canada these reports are given in kilopascals .",
  "/wiki/Pressure": "Pressure ( symbol : p or P ) is the force applied perpendicular to the surface of an object per unit area over which that force is distributed . Gauge pressure ( also spelled gage pressure ) [ a ] is the pressure relative to the ambient pressure . Various units are used to express pressure . Some of these derive from a unit of force divided by a unit of area ; the SI unit of pressure , the pascal ( Pa ) , for example , is one newton per square metre ( N/m2 ) ; similarly , the pound-force per square inch ( psi ) is the traditional unit of pressure in the imperial and US customary systems . Pressure may also be expressed in terms of standard atmospheric pressure ; the atmosphere ( atm ) is equal to this pressure , and the torr is defined as \u200b1\u2044760 of this . Manometric units such as the centimetre of water , millimetre of mercury , and inch of mercury are used to express pressures in terms of the height of column of a particular fluid in a manometer .",
  "/wiki/Stress_(physics)": "In continuum mechanics , stress is a physical quantity that expresses the internal forces that neighbouring particles of a continuous material exert on each other , while strain is the measure of the deformation of the material . For example , when a solid vertical bar is supporting an overhead weight , each particle in the bar pushes on the particles immediately below it . When a liquid is in a closed container under pressure , each particle gets pushed against by all the surrounding particles . The container walls and the pressure-inducing surface ( such as a piston ) push against them in ( Newtonian ) reaction . These macroscopic forces are actually the net result of a very large number of intermolecular forces and collisions between the particles in those molecules . Stress is frequently represented by a lowercase Greek letter sigma ( \u03c3 ) . Strain inside a material may arise by various mechanisms , such as stress as applied by external forces to the bulk material ( like gravity ) or to its surface ( like contact forces , external pressure , or friction ) . Any strain ( deformation ) of a solid material generates an internal elastic stress , analogous to the reaction force of a spring , that tends to restore the material to its original non-deformed state . In liquids and gases , only deformations that change the volume generate persistent elastic stress . However , if the deformation changes gradually with time , even in fluids there will usually be some viscous stress , opposing that change . Elastic and viscous stresses are usually combined under the name mechanical stress .",
  "/wiki/Joule": "The joule ( /d\u0292a\u028al , d\u0292u\u02d0l/ jawl , jool ; symbol : J ) is a derived unit of energy in the International System of Units . It is equal to the energy transferred to ( or work done on ) an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of the force 's motion through a distance of one metre ( 1 newton metre or N\u22c5m ) . It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second . It is named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule ( 1818-1889 ) . In terms firstly of base SI units and then in terms of other SI units , a joule is defined below , where kg is the kilogram , m is the metre , s is the second , N is the newton , Pa is the pascal , W is the watt , C is the coulomb , and V is the volt :",
  "/wiki/Energy": "In physics , energy is the quantitative property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on , or to heat , the object . [ note 1 ] Energy is a conserved quantity ; the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form , but not created or destroyed . The SI unit of energy is the joule , which is the energy transferred to an object by the work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton . Common forms of energy include the kinetic energy of a moving object , the potential energy stored by an object 's position in a force field ( gravitational , electric or magnetic ) , the elastic energy stored by stretching solid objects , the chemical energy released when a fuel burns , the radiant energy carried by light , and the thermal energy due to an object 's temperature . Mass and energy are closely related . Due to mass-energy equivalence , any object that has mass when stationary ( called rest mass ) also has an equivalent amount of energy whose form is called rest energy , and any additional energy ( of any form ) acquired by the object above that rest energy will increase the object 's total mass just as it increases its total energy . For example , after heating an object , its increase in energy could be measured as a small increase in mass , with a sensitive enough scale . Living organisms require energy to stay alive , such as the energy humans get from food . Human civilization requires energy to function , which it gets from energy resources such as fossil fuels , nuclear fuel , or renewable energy . The processes of Earth 's climate and ecosystem are driven by the radiant energy Earth receives from the sun and the geothermal energy contained within the earth .",
  "/wiki/Mechanical_work": "In physics , work is the product of force and displacement . A force is said to do work if , when acting , there is a movement of the point of application in the direction of the force . For example , when a ball is held above the ground and then dropped , the work done on the ball as it falls is equal to the weight of the ball ( a force ) multiplied by the distance to the ground ( a displacement ) . When the force F { \\displaystyle F } is constant and the angle between the force and the displacement s { \\displaystyle s } is \u03b8 , then the work done is given by W = Fs cos \u03b8 . Work transfers energy from one place to another , or one form to another . The SI unit of work is the joule ( J ) .",
  "/wiki/Heat": "In thermodynamics , heat is energy in transfer to or from a thermodynamic system , by mechanisms other than thermodynamic work or transfer of matter . The mechanisms include conduction , through direct contact of immobile bodies , or through a wall or barrier that is impermeable to matter ; or radiation between separated bodies ; or friction due to isochoric mechanical or electrical or magnetic or gravitational work done by the surroundings on the system of interest , such as Joule heating due to an electric current driven through the system of interest by an external system , or through a magnetic stirrer . When there is a suitable path between two systems with different temperatures , heat transfer occurs necessarily , immediately , and spontaneously from the hotter to the colder system . Thermal conduction occurs by the stochastic ( random ) motion of microscopic particles ( such as atoms or molecules ) . In contrast , thermodynamic work is defined by mechanisms that act macroscopically and directly on the system 's whole-body state variables ; for example , change of the system 's volume through a piston 's motion with externally measurable force ; or change of the system 's internal electric polarization through an externally measurable change in electric field . The definition of heat transfer does not require that the process be in any sense smooth . For example , a bolt of lightning may transfer heat to a body . Convective circulation allows one body to heat another , through an intermediate circulating fluid that carries energy from a boundary of one to a boundary of the other ; the actual heat transfer is by conduction and radiation between the fluid and the respective bodies . Convective circulation , though spontaneous , does not necessarily and immediately occur simply because of some slight temperature difference ; for it to occur in a given arrangement of systems , there is a threshold that must be crossed . Like thermodynamic work , heat transfer is a process involving more than one system , not a property of any one system . In thermodynamics , energy transferred as heat ( a process function ) contributes to change in the system 's cardinal energy variable of state , for example its internal energy , or for example its enthalpy . This is to be distinguished from the ordinary language conception of heat as a property of an isolated system .",
  "/wiki/Watt": "The watt ( symbol : W ) is a unit of power . In the International System of Units ( SI ) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second , and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer . In SI base units , the watt is described as k g m 2 s \u2212 3 { \\displaystyle kg\\ , m^ { 2 } s^ { -3 } } , which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis .

The SI unit of radiant flux is the watt ( W ) , that is the joule per second ( J/s ) in SI base units , while that of spectral flux in frequency is the watt per hertz ( W/Hz ) and that of spectral flux in wavelength is the watt per metre ( W/m ) - commonly the watt per nanometre ( W/nm ) .",

  "/wiki/Electric_charge": "Electric charge is the physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field . There are two types of electric charge : positive and negative ( commonly carried by protons and electrons respectively ) . Like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other . An object with an absence of net charge is referred to as neutral . Early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now called classical electrodynamics , and is still accurate for problems that do not require consideration of quantum effects . Electric charge is a conserved property ; the net charge of an isolated system , the amount of positive charge minus the amount of negative charge , can not change . Electric charge is carried by subatomic particles . In ordinary matter , negative charge is carried by electrons , and positive charge is carried by the protons in the nuclei of atoms . If there are more electrons than protons in a piece of matter , it will have a negative charge , if there are fewer it will have a positive charge , and if there are equal numbers it will be neutral . Charge is quantized ; it comes in integer multiples of individual small units called the elementary charge , e , about 1.602\u00d710\u221219 coulombs , which is the smallest charge which can exist freely ( particles called quarks have smaller charges , multiples of 1/3e , but they are only found in combination , and always combine to form particles with integer charge ) .

  "/wiki/Volt": "The volt ( symbol : V ) is the derived unit for electric potential , electric potential difference ( voltage ) , and electromotive force . It is named after the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta ( 1745-1827 ) .",
  "/wiki/Voltage": "Voltage , electric potential difference , electric pressure or electric tension is the difference in electric potential between two points . The difference in electric potential between two points ( i.e. , voltage ) in a static electric field is defined as the work needed per unit of charge to move a test charge between the two points . In the International System of Units , the derived unit for voltage is named volt . In SI units , work per unit charge is expressed as joules per coulomb , where 1 volt = 1 joule ( of work ) per 1 coulomb ( of charge ) . The official SI definition for volt uses power and current , where 1 volt = 1 watt ( of power ) per 1 ampere ( of current ) . This definition is equivalent to the more commonly used 'joules per coulomb ' . Voltage or electric potential difference is denoted symbolically by \u2206V , but more often simply as V , for instance in the context of Ohm 's or Kirchhoff 's circuit laws . Electric potential differences between points can be caused by electric charge , by electric current through a magnetic field , by time-varying magnetic fields , or some combination of these three . A voltmeter can be used to measure the voltage ( or potential difference ) between two points in a system ; often a common reference potential such as the ground of the system is used as one of the points . A voltage may represent either a source of energy ( electromotive force ) or lost , used , or stored energy ( potential drop ) .",
  "/wiki/Electrical_potential_difference": "An electric potential ( also called the electric field potential , potential drop or the electrostatic potential ) is the amount of work needed to move a unit of charge from a reference point to a specific point inside the field without producing an acceleration . Typically , the reference point is the Earth or a point at infinity , although any point can be used . In classical electrostatics , the electrostatic field is a vector quantity which is expressed as the gradient of the electrostatic potential , which is a scalar quantity denoted by V or occasionally \u03c6 , equal to the electric potential energy of any charged particle at any location ( measured in joules ) divided by the charge of that particle ( measured in coulombs ) . By dividing out the charge on the particle a quotient is obtained that is a property of the electric field itself . In short , electric potential is the electric potential energy per unit charge . This value can be calculated in either a static ( time-invariant ) or a dynamic ( varying with time ) electric field at a specific time in units of joules per coulomb ( J C\u22121 ) , or volts ( V ) . The electric potential at infinity is assumed to be zero . In electrodynamics , when time-varying fields are present , the electric field can not be expressed only in terms of a scalar potential . Instead , the electric field can be expressed in terms of both the scalar electric potential and the magnetic vector potential . The electric potential and the magnetic vector potential together form a four vector , so that the two kinds of potential are mixed under Lorentz transformations . Practically , electric potential is always a continuous function in space ; Otherwise , the spatial derivative of it will yield a field with infinite magnitude , which is practically impossible . Even an idealized point charge has 1 / r { \\displaystyle 1/r } potential , which is continuous everywhere except the origin .",
  "/wiki/Electromotive_force": "Electromotive force ( emf , denoted E { \\displaystyle { \\mathcal { E } } } and measured in volts ) , is the electrical action produced by a non-electrical source . A device that converts other forms of energy into electrical energy ( a transducer ) , such as a battery ( converting chemical energy ) or generator ( converting mechanical energy ) , provides an emf as its output . Sometimes an analogy to water pressure is used to describe electromotive force . ( The word force in this case is not used to mean force of interaction between bodies , as may be measured in pounds or newtons . ) In electromagnetic induction , emf can be defined around a closed loop of conductor as the electromagnetic work that would be done on an electric charge ( an electron in this instance ) if it travels once around the loop . For a time-varying magnetic flux linking a loop , the electric potential scalar field is not defined due to a circulating electric vector field , but an emf nevertheless does work that can be measured as a virtual electric potential around the loop . In the case of a two-terminal device ( such as an electrochemical cell ) which is modeled as a Th\u00e9venin 's equivalent circuit , the equivalent emf can be measured as the open-circuit potential difference or voltage between the two terminals . This potential difference can drive an electric current if an external circuit is attached to the terminals .",

  "/wiki/Capacitance": "Capacitance is the ratio of the change in electric charge of a system , to the corresponding change in its electric potential . There are two closely related notions of capacitance : self capacitance and mutual capacitance . Any object that can be electrically charged exhibits self capacitance . A material with a large self capacitance holds more electric charge at a given voltage than one with low capacitance . The notion of mutual capacitance is particularly important for understanding the operations of the capacitor , one of the three elementary linear electronic components ( along with resistors and inductors ) . The capacitance is a function only of the geometry of the design ( e.g . area of the plates and the distance between them ) and the permittivity of the dielectric material between the plates of the capacitor . For many dielectric materials , the permittivity and thus the capacitance , is independent of the potential difference between the conductors and the total charge on them . The SI unit of capacitance is the farad ( symbol : F ) , named after the English physicist Michael Faraday . A 1 farad capacitor , when charged with 1 coulomb of electrical charge , has a potential difference of 1 volt between its plates . The reciprocal of capacitance is called elastance .",

The definition of the ohm was revised several times . Today , the definition of the ohm is expressed from the quantum Hall effect .",
  "/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance": "The electrical resistance of an object is a measure of its opposition to the flow of electric current . The inverse quantity is electrical conductance , and is the ease with which an electric current passes . Electrical resistance shares some conceptual parallels with the notion of mechanical friction . The SI unit of electrical resistance is the ohm ( \u03a9 ) , while electrical conductance is measured in siemens ( S ) . The resistance of an object depends in large part on the material it is made of - objects made of electrical insulators like rubber tend to have very high resistance and low conductivity , while objects made of electrical conductors like metals tend to have very low resistance and high conductivity . This material dependence is quantified by resistivity or conductivity . However , resistance and conductance are extensive rather than bulk properties , meaning that they also depend on the size and shape of an object . For example , a wire 's resistance is higher if it is long and thin , and lower if it is short and thick . All objects show some resistance , except for superconductors , which have a resistance of zero . The resistance ( R ) of an object is defined as the ratio of voltage across it ( V ) to current through it ( I ) , while the conductance ( G ) is the reciprocal :",
  "/wiki/Electrical_impedance": "Electrical impedance is the measure of the opposition that a circuit presents to a current when a voltage is applied . The term complex impedance may be used interchangeably . Quantitatively , the impedance of a two-terminal circuit element is the ratio of the complex representation of a sinusoidal voltage between its terminals to the complex representation of the current flowing through it . In general , it depends upon the frequency of the sinusoidal voltage . Impedance extends the concept of resistance to AC circuits , and possesses both magnitude and phase , unlike resistance , which has only magnitude . When a circuit is driven with direct current ( DC ) , there is no distinction between impedance and resistance ; the latter can be thought of as impedance with zero phase angle . The notion of impedance is useful for performing AC analysis of electrical networks , because it allows relating sinusoidal voltages and currents by a simple linear law . In multiple port networks , the two-terminal definition of impedance is inadequate , but the complex voltages at the ports and the currents flowing through them are still linearly related by the impedance matrix . Impedance is a complex number , with the same units as resistance , for which the SI unit is the ohm ( \u03a9 ) . Its symbol is usually Z , and it may be represented by writing its magnitude and phase in the form |Z|\u2220\u03b8 .

Conductance , susceptance , and admittance are the reciprocals of resistance , reactance , and impedance respectively ; hence one siemens is redundantly equal to the reciprocal of one ohm , and is also referred to as the mho . The 14th General Conference on Weights and Measures approved the addition of the siemens as a derived unit in 1971 . The unit is named after Ernst Werner von Siemens . In English , the same form siemens is used both for the singular and plural .",
  "/wiki/Electrical_conductance": "The electrical resistance of an object is a measure of its opposition to the flow of electric current . The inverse quantity is electrical conductance , and is the ease with which an electric current passes . Electrical resistance shares some conceptual parallels with the notion of mechanical friction . The SI unit of electrical resistance is the ohm ( \u03a9 ) , while electrical conductance is measured in siemens ( S ) . The resistance of an object depends in large part on the material it is made of - objects made of electrical insulators like rubber tend to have very high resistance and low conductivity , while objects made of electrical conductors like metals tend to have very low resistance and high conductivity . This material dependence is quantified by resistivity or conductivity . However , resistance and conductance are extensive rather than bulk properties , meaning that they also depend on the size and shape of an object . For example , a wire 's resistance is higher if it is long and thin , and lower if it is short and thick . All objects show some resistance , except for superconductors , which have a resistance of zero . The resistance ( R ) of an object is defined as the ratio of voltage across it ( V ) to current through it ( I ) , while the conductance ( G ) is the reciprocal :",

  "/wiki/Inductance": "In electromagnetism and electronics , inductance is the tendency of an electrical conductor to oppose a change in the electric current flowing through it . The flow of electric current through a conductor creates a magnetic field around the conductor , whose strength depends on the magnitude of the current . A change in current causes a change in the magnetic field . From Faraday 's law of induction , any change in magnetic field through a circuit induces an electromotive force ( EMF ) ( voltage ) in the conductors ; this is known as electromagnetic induction . So the changing current induces a voltage in the conductor . This induced voltage is in a direction which tends to oppose the change in current ( as stated by Lenz 's law ) , so it is called a back EMF . Due to this back EMF , a conductor 's inductance opposes any increase or decrease in electric current through it . Inductance is defined as the ratio of the induced voltage to the rate of change of current causing it . It is a proportionality factor that depends on the geometry of circuit conductors and the magnetic permeability of nearby materials . An electronic component designed to add inductance to a circuit is called an inductor . It typically consists of a coil or helix of wire . The term inductance was coined by Oliver Heaviside in 1886 .",
  "/wiki/Celsius": "The Celsius scale , also known as the centigrade scale , is a temperature scale . As an SI derived unit , it is used worldwide . In the United States , the Bahamas , Belize , the Cayman Islands and Liberia , Fahrenheit remains the preferred scale for everyday temperature measurement . The degree Celsius ( symbol : \u00b0C ) can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale or a unit to indicate a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty . It is named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius ( 1701-1744 ) , who developed a similar temperature scale . Before being renamed to honor Anders Celsius in 1948 , the unit was called centigrade , from the Latin centum , which means 100 , and gradus , which means steps . From 1743 , the Celsius scale is based on 0 \u00b0C for the freezing point of water and 100 \u00b0C for the boiling point of water at 1 atm pressure . Prior to 1743 , the scale was also based on the boiling and melting points of water , but the values were reversed ( i.e . the boiling point was at 0 degrees and the melting point was at 100 degrees ) . The 1743 scale reversal was proposed by Jean-Pierre Christin . By international agreement , between 1954 and 2019 the unit degree Celsius and the Celsius scale were defined by absolute zero and the triple point of Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water ( VSMOW ) , a precisely defined water standard . This definition also precisely related the Celsius scale to the Kelvin scale , which defines the SI base unit of thermodynamic temperature with symbol K. Absolute zero , the lowest temperature possible , is defined as being exactly 0 K and \u2212273.15 \u00b0C .",
  "/wiki/Temperature": "Temperature is a physical property of matter that quantitatively expresses hot and cold . Temperature is measured with a thermometer . Temperature is the manifestation of thermal energy , present in all matter , which is the source of the occurrence of heat , a flow of energy , when a body is in contact with another that is colder . Thermometers are calibrated in various temperature scales that historically have used various reference points and thermometric substances for definition . The most common scales are the Celsius scale ( formerly called centigrade ) , denoted \u00b0C , the Fahrenheit scale ( denoted \u00b0F ) , and the Kelvin scale ( denoted K ) , the latter of which is predominantly used for scientific purposes by conventions of the International System of Units ( SI ) . When a body has no macroscopic chemical reactions or flows of matter or energy , it is said to be in its own internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium . Its temperature is uniform in space and unchanging in time . The lowest theoretical temperature is absolute zero , at which no more thermal energy can be extracted from a body . Experimentally , it can only be approached very closely , but not reached , which is recognized in the third law of thermodynamics . Temperature is important in all fields of natural science , including physics , chemistry , Earth science , medicine , and biology , as well as most aspects of daily life .",
  "/wiki/Absolute_zero": "Absolute zero is the lowest limit of the thermodynamic temperature scale , a state at which the enthalpy and entropy of a cooled ideal gas reach their minimum value , taken as zero kelvins . The fundamental particles of nature have minimum vibrational motion , retaining only quantum mechanical , zero-point energy-induced particle motion . The theoretical temperature is determined by extrapolating the ideal gas law ; by international agreement , absolute zero is taken as \u2212273.15\u00b0 on the Celsius scale ( International System of Units ) , which equals \u2212459.67\u00b0 on the Fahrenheit scale ( United States customary units or Imperial units ) . The corresponding Kelvin and Rankine temperature scales set their zero points at absolute zero by definition . It is commonly thought of as the lowest temperature possible , but it is not the lowest enthalpy state possible , because all real substances begin to depart from the ideal gas when cooled as they approach the change of state to liquid , and then to solid ; and the sum of the enthalpy of vaporization ( gas to liquid ) and enthalpy of fusion ( liquid to solid ) exceeds the ideal gas 's change in enthalpy to absolute zero . In the quantum-mechanical description , matter ( solid ) at absolute zero is in its ground state , the point of lowest internal energy . The laws of thermodynamics indicate that absolute zero can not be reached using only thermodynamic means , because the temperature of the substance being cooled approaches the temperature of the cooling agent asymptotically , and a system at absolute zero still possesses quantum mechanical zero-point energy , the energy of its ground state at absolute zero . The kinetic energy of the ground state can not be removed . Scientists and technologists routinely achieve temperatures close to absolute zero , where matter exhibits quantum effects such as superconductivity and superfluidity .",

  "/wiki/Illuminance": "In photometry , illuminance is the total luminous flux incident on a surface , per unit area . It is a measure of how much the incident light illuminates the surface , wavelength-weighted by the luminosity function to correlate with human brightness perception .

In SI derived units these are measured in lux ( lx ) , or equivalently in lumens per square metre ( cd\u00b7sr\u00b7m\u22122 ) . In the CGS system , the unit of illuminance is the phot , which is equal to 10000 lux . The foot-candle is a non-metric unit of illuminance that is used in photography . Illuminance was formerly often called brightness , but this leads to confusion with other uses of the word , such as to mean luminance . Brightness should never be used for quantitative description , but only for nonquantitative references to physiological sensations and perceptions of light .

  "/wiki/Radioactivity": "Radioactive decay ( also known as nuclear decay , radioactivity , radioactive disintegration or nuclear disintegration ) is the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by radiation . A material containing unstable nuclei is considered radioactive . Three of the most common types of decay are alpha decay , beta decay , and gamma decay , all of which involve emitting one or more particles or photons . Radioactive decay is a stochastic ( i.e . random ) process at the level of single atoms . According to quantum theory , it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay , regardless of how long the atom has existed . However , for a significant number of identical atoms , the overall decay rate can be expressed as a decay constant or as half-life . The half-lives of radioactive atoms have a huge range ; from nearly instantaneous to far longer than the age of the universe . The decaying nucleus is called the parent radionuclide ( or parent radioisotope [ note 1 ] ) , and the process produces at least one daughter nuclide . Except for gamma decay or internal conversion from a nuclear excited state , the decay is a nuclear transmutation resulting in a daughter containing a different number of protons or neutrons ( or both ) . When the number of protons changes , an atom of a different chemical element is created .",

  "/wiki/Ionizing_radiation": "Ionizing radiation ( ionising radiation ) is radiation , traveling as a particle or electromagnetic wave , that carries sufficient energy to detach electrons from atoms or molecules , thereby ionizing them . Ionizing radiation is made up of energetic subatomic particles , ions or atoms moving at high speeds ( usually greater than 1% of the speed of light ) , and electromagnetic waves on the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum . [ citation needed ] Gamma rays , X-rays , and the higher ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum are ionizing , whereas the lower ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum and all the spectrum below UV , including visible light ( including nearly all types of laser light ) , infrared , microwaves , and radio waves are considered non-ionizing radiation . The boundary between ionizing and non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation that occurs in the ultraviolet is not sharply defined , since different molecules and atoms ionize at different energies . Conventional definition places the boundary at a photon energy between 10 eV and 33 eV in the ultraviolet ( see definition boundary section below ) . Typical ionizing subatomic particles found in radioactive decay include alpha particles , beta particles and neutrons . Almost all products of radioactive decay are ionizing because the energy of radioactive decay is typically far higher than that required to ionize . Other subatomic ionizing particles which occur naturally are muons , mesons , positrons , and other particles that constitute the secondary cosmic particles that are produced after primary cosmic rays interact with Earth 's atmosphere . Cosmic rays are generated by stars and certain celestial events such as supernova explosions . Cosmic rays may also produce radioisotopes on Earth ( for example , carbon-14 ) , which in turn decay and produce ionizing radiation . Cosmic rays and the decay of radioactive isotopes are the primary sources of natural ionizing radiation on Earth referred to as background radiation . Ionizing radiation can also be generated artificially by X-ray tubes , particle accelerators , and any of the various methods that produce radioisotopes artificially ."
