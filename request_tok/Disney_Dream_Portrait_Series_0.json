The film features the voices of Kathryn Beaumont as Alice , Sterling Holloway as the Cheshire Cat , Verna Felton as the Queen of Hearts , and Ed Wynn as the Mad Hatter . Walt Disney first attempted unsuccessfully to adapt Alice into an animated feature film during the 1930s , and he revived the idea in the 1940s . The film was originally intended to be a live-action/animated film ; however , Disney decided to make it an all-animated feature in 1946 . The film was considered a flop on its initial release , leading to Walt Disney showing it on television as one of the first episodes of his TV series Disneyland . It proved to be very successful on television , especially during the psychedelic era . It was eventually re-released in theaters which proved to be massively successful . The film became even more successful through merchandising and subsequent home video releases . The theme song of the same name has since become a jazz standard . While the film was critically panned on its initial release , it has since been regarded as one of Disney 's greatest animated classics , notably one of the biggest cult classics in the animation medium , as well as one of the best film adaptations of Alice . A live-action adaptation of Carroll 's works and animated film , Alice in Wonderland , directed by Tim Burton , was released in 2010 .",

  "/wiki/Alice_(Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland)": "Alice is a fictional character and protagonist of Lewis Carroll 's children 's novel Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland ( 1865 ) and its sequel , Through the Looking-Glass ( 1871 ) . A child in the mid-Victorian era , Alice unintentionally goes on an underground adventure after accidentally falling down a rabbit hole into Wonderland ; in the sequel , she steps through a mirror into an alternative world . The character originated in stories told by Carroll to entertain the Liddell sisters while rowing on the Isis with his friend Robinson Duckworth , and on subsequent rowing trips . Although she shares her given name with Alice Liddell , scholars disagree about the extent to which she was based upon Liddell . Characterized by Carroll as loving and gentle , courteous to all , trustful , and wildly curious , Alice has been variously seen as clever , well-mannered , and sceptical of authority , although some commentators find more negative aspects of her personality . Her appearance changed from Alice 's Adventures Under Ground , the first draft of Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland , to political cartoonist John Tenniel 's illustrations of her in the two Alice books . Alice has been identified as a cultural icon . She has been described as a departure from the usual nineteenth-century child protagonist , and the success of the two Alice books inspired numerous sequels , parodies , and imitations , with protagonists similar to Alice in temperament . She has been interpreted through various critical approaches , and has appeared and been re-imagined in numerous adaptations , including Walt Disney 's film ( 1951 ) . Her continuing appeal has been ascribed to her ability to be continuously re-imagined .",

  "/wiki/King_Arthur": "King Arthur was a legendary British leader who , according to medieval histories and romances , led the defence of Britain against Saxon invaders in the late 5th and early 6th centuries . The details of Arthur 's story are mainly composed of folklore and literary invention , and modern historians generally agree that he is unhistorical . The sparse historical background of Arthur is gleaned from various sources , including the Annales Cambriae , the Historia Brittonum , and the writings of Gildas . Arthur 's name also occurs in early poetic sources such as Y Gododdin . Arthur is a central figure in the legends making up the Matter of Britain . The legendary Arthur developed as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth 's fanciful and imaginative 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae ( History of the Kings of Britain ) . In some Welsh and Breton tales and poems that date from before this work , Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore , sometimes associated with the Welsh otherworld Annwn . How much of Geoffrey 's Historia ( completed in 1138 ) was adapted from such earlier sources , rather than invented by Geoffrey himself , is unknown . Although the themes , events and characters of the Arthurian legend varied widely from text to text , and there is no one canonical version , Geoffrey 's version of events often served as the starting point for later stories . Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons and established a vast empire . Many elements and incidents that are now an integral part of the Arthurian story appear in Geoffrey 's Historia , including Arthur 's father Uther Pendragon , the magician Merlin , Arthur 's wife Guinevere , the sword Excalibur , Arthur 's conception at Tintagel , his final battle against Mordred at Camlann , and final rest in Avalon .

  "/wiki/Princess_Jasmine": "Princess Jasmine is a fictional character who appears in Walt Disney Pictures ' 31st animated feature film Aladdin ( 1992 ) . Voiced by American actress Linda Larkin - with a singing voice provided by Filipina singer Lea Salonga - Jasmine is the spirited Princess of Agrabah , who has grown weary of her life of palace confinement . Despite an age-old law stipulating that the princess must marry a prince in time for her upcoming birthday , Jasmine is instead determined to marry someone she loves for who he is as opposed to what he owns . Created by directors Ron Clements and John Musker with screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio , Jasmine is based on Badroulbadour , a princess who appears in the One Thousand and One Nights folktale Aladdin and the Magical Lamp . Originally conceived as a spoiled , materialistic princess , the writers eventually re-wrote Jasmine into a stronger and more prominent heroine following the elimination of Aladdin 's mother from the script , while borrowing story elements from the romantic comedy Roman Holiday ( 1953 ) . Several months after securing the role , Larkin was nearly fired from the project because Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg felt that her voice was not suitable for a princess , but Clements and Musker managed to convince him otherwise . Discovered by casting director Albert Tavares , Lea Salonga was cast as Jasmine 's singing voice based on her performance in the musical Miss Saigon ; this unprecedented casting decision made Jasmine the first Disney Princess to have her speaking and singing voices provided by two different actresses . Animated by Mark Henn , Jasmine 's design is an eclectic combination of unique sources , including an anonymous theme park guest , Henn 's own sister , and actress Jennifer Connelly . Unlike most of Disney 's princesses , Jasmine is a supporting character in her own film , taking the secondary role of the love interest . The character has garnered mixed-to-positive reviews , with much of her character arc compared unfavorably to her predecessors Ariel and Belle from The Little Mermaid ( 1989 ) and Beauty and the Beast ( 1991 ) but has been praised for her personality and her chemistry with Aladdin . As the sixth Disney Princess and the franchise 's first non-European member , the character is credited with introducing racial diversity to Disney 's princess genre . Jasmine has made subsequent appearances in Aladdin 's sequels The Return of Jafar ( 1994 ) and Aladdin and the King of Thieves ( 1996 ) , as well as its television series and a Broadway musical adaption of the film .",

  "/wiki/Aurora_(Disney)": "Princess Aurora , also known as Sleeping Beauty or Briar Rose , is a fictional character who appears in Walt Disney Productions ' 16th animated feature film Sleeping Beauty ( 1959 ) . Originally voiced by singer Mary Costa , Aurora is the only daughter of King Stefan and Queen Leah . But an evil fairy named Maleficent seeks revenge for not being invited to Aurora 's christening and curses the newborn princess , foretelling that she will die before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday by pricking her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel . Determined to prevent this , three good fairies raise Aurora as a peasant in order to protect her , patiently awaiting her 16th birthday - the day the spell can only be broken by a kiss from her true love , Prince Phillip . Aurora is based on the princess in Charles Perrault 's fairy tale Sleeping Beauty , as well as the heroine who appears in the Brothers Grimm 's retelling of the story , Little Briar Rose . For several years , Walt Disney had struggled to find a suitable actress to voice the princess and nearly abandoned film entirely until Costa was discovered by composer Walter Schumann . However , Costa 's southern accent nearly cost her the role until she proved that she could sustain a British accent for the duration of film . In order to accommodate the film 's unprecedentedly detailed backgrounds , Aurora 's refined design demanded more effort than had ever been spent on an animated character before , with the animators drawing inspiration from Art Nouveau . Animated by Marc Davis , Aurora 's slender physique was inspired by actress Audrey Hepburn . With only 18 lines of dialogue and equally as few minutes of screen time , the character speaks less than any speaking main character in a feature-length Disney animated film . When Sleeping Beauty was first released in 1959 , the film was both a critical and commercial failure , discouraging the studio from adapting fairy tales into animated films for three decades . Aurora herself received negative reviews from both film and feminist critics for her passivity and similarities to Snow White , and would remain Disney 's last princess until The Little Mermaid 's Ariel debuted 30 years later in 1989 .",

Other versions of the Queen appear in Snow White derivative works , and the character has also become an archetype for unrelated works of fiction .

A driving force in the story is the Queen 's Magic Mirror . In the traditional resolution of the story , the Queen is grotesquely executed for her crimes .

Various other versions of the Queen appear in subsequent adaptations and continuations of the fairy tale , including novels and films . In these , the Queen is often re-imagined and sometimes portrayed more sympathetically , such as being morally conflicted or suffering from madness instead of being simply evil . In some of the revisionist stories she has even been portrayed as an antihero or a tragic hero . In some instances , she serves as the protagonist of the story ; one such particularly notable version is Disney 's , sometimes known as Queen Grimhilde .

When her father Maurice is imprisoned by a cold-hearted beast , Belle offers him her own freedom in exchange for her father 's , and eventually learns to love the Beast despite his unsightly outward appearance . Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg commissioned Beauty and the Beast as an animated musical with a strong heroine and hired first-time screenwriter Linda Woolverton to write it . Basing her on the heroine of Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont 's fairy tale Beauty and the Beast , Woolverton adapted Belle into a stronger and less passive character for the film . Inspired by the women 's rights movement , Woolverton wanted Belle to be a unique Disney heroine different from The Little Mermaid 's popular Ariel , and thus deliberately conceived the character as a feminist in an effort to avoid the criticism Disney had long been receiving due to the studio 's reputation of depicting its female characters as victims . Belle 's strength and love of reading was inspired by American actress Katharine Hepburn 's performance as Jo March in the film Little Women ( 1933 ) , while the writers instilled the adventure-seeking heroine with goals and aspirations beyond romance . However , the story artists and animators often contested Woolverton 's liberated vision for the character . Animated by James Baxter and Mark Henn , the former of whom based the character 's graceful gait on those of impressionist Edgar Degas ' ballerinas , Belle 's European facial features were inspired by those of British actresses Vivien Leigh and Audrey Hepburn . Several additional Hollywood actresses inspired Belle 's appearance , including Natalie Wood , Elizabeth Taylor , and Grace Kelly . Belle has garnered widespread acclaim from film critics who appreciated the character 's bravery , intelligence and independence . Reception towards her feminism , however , has been more mixed , with commentators accusing the character 's actions of being romance-oriented .",
