The dam is located 40 miles ( 64 km ) east of Portland , Oregon , in the Columbia River Gorge . The primary functions of Bonneville Lock and Dam are electrical power generation and river navigation . The dam was built and is managed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers . At the time of its construction in the 1930s it was the largest water impoundment project of its type in the nation , able to withstand flooding on an unprecedented scale . Electrical power generated at Bonneville is distributed by the Bonneville Power Administration . Bonneville Lock and Dam is named for Army Capt . Benjamin Bonneville , an early explorer credited with charting much of the Oregon Trail . The Bonneville Dam Historic District was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1987 .",

  "/wiki/Construction": "Construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure . Construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser , while construction typically takes place on location for a known client . Construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries . Construction starts with planning , design , and financing ; it continues until the project is built and ready for use . Large-scale construction requires collaboration across multiple disciplines . A project manager normally manages the budget on the job , and a construction manager , design engineer , construction engineer or architect supervises it . Those involved with the design and execution must consider zoning requirements , environmental impact of the job , scheduling , budgeting , construction-site safety , availability and transportation of building materials , logistics , inconvenience to the public caused by construction delays and bidding . Large construction projects are sometimes referred to as megaprojects .",
  "/wiki/Columbia_River": "The Columbia River is the largest river in the Pacific Northwest region of North America . The river rises in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia , Canada . It flows northwest and then south into the US state of Washington , then turns west to form most of the border between Washington and the state of Oregon before emptying into the Pacific Ocean . The river is 1,243 miles ( 2,000 km ) long , and its largest tributary is the Snake River . Its drainage basin is roughly the size of France and extends into seven US states and a Canadian province . The fourth-largest river in the United States by volume , the Columbia has the greatest flow of any North American river entering the Pacific . The Columbia and its tributaries have been central to the region 's culture and economy for thousands of years . They have been used for transportation since ancient times , linking the region 's many cultural groups . The river system hosts many species of anadromous fish , which migrate between freshwater habitats and the saline waters of the Pacific Ocean . These fish - especially the salmon species - provided the core subsistence for native peoples . In the late 18th century , a private American ship became the first non-indigenous vessel to enter the river ; it was followed by a British explorer , who navigated past the Oregon Coast Range into the Willamette Valley . In the following decades , fur trading companies used the Columbia as a key transportation route .",
  "/wiki/Electricity": "Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter that has a property of electric charge . In early days , electricity was considered as being unrelated to magnetism . Later on , many experimental results and the development of Maxwell 's equations indicated that both electricity and magnetism are from a single phenomenon : electromagnetism . Various common phenomena are related to electricity , including lightning , static electricity , electric heating , electric discharges and many others . The presence of an electric charge , which can be either positive or negative , produces an electric field . The movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field . When a charge is placed in a location with a non-zero electric field , a force will act on it . The magnitude of this force is given by Coulomb 's law . Thus , if that charge were to move , the electric field would be doing work on the electric charge . Thus we can speak of electric potential at a certain point in space , which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts . Electricity is at the heart of many modern technologies , being used for :",
  "/wiki/Electricity_generation": "Electricity generation is the process of generating electric power from sources of primary energy . For utilities in the electric power industry , it is the stage prior to its delivery to end users ( transmission , distribution , etc . ) or its storage ( using , for example , the pumped-storage method ) . A characteristic of electricity is that it is not freely available in nature in large amounts , so it must be produced ( that is , transforming other forms of energy to electricity ) . Production is carried out in power stations ( also called power plants ) . Electricity is most often generated at a power plant by electromechanical generators , primarily driven by heat engines fueled by combustion or nuclear fission but also by other means such as the kinetic energy of flowing water and wind . Other energy sources include solar photovoltaics and geothermal power .",
  "/wiki/Hydroelectricity": "Hydroelectricity is electricity produced from hydropower . In 2015 , hydropower generated 16.6% of the world 's total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity , and was expected to increase by about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years . Hydropower is produced in 150 countries , with the Asia-Pacific region generating 33 percent of global hydropower in 2013 . China is the largest hydroelectricity producer , with 920 TWh of production in 2013 , representing 16.9% of domestic electricity use . The cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low , making it a competitive source of renewable electricity . The hydro station consumes no water , unlike coal or gas plants . The typical cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt hour . With a dam and reservoir it is also a flexible source of electricity , since the amount produced by the station can be varied up or down very rapidly ( as little as a few seconds ) to adapt to changing energy demands . Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed , the project produces no direct waste , and it generally has a considerably lower output level of greenhouse gases than photovoltaic power plants and certainly fossil fuel powered energy plants ( see also Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources ) . However , when constructed in lowland rainforest areas , where inundation of a part of the forest is necessary , they actually emit up to 3 to 4 times more greenhouse gases [ clarification needed ] ( see also Environmental_impact_of_reservoirs # Greenhouse_gases ) .",
  "/wiki/Dam": "A dam is a barrier that stops or restricts the flow of water or underground streams . Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such as irrigation , human consumption , industrial use , aquaculture , and navigability . Hydropower is often used in conjunction with dams to generate electricity . A dam can also be used to collect water or for storage of water which can be evenly distributed between locations . Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water , while other structures such as floodgates or levees ( also known as dikes ) are used to manage or prevent water flow into specific land regions . The earliest known dam is the Jawa Dam in Jordan , dating to 3,000 BC . The word dam can be traced back to Middle English , and before that , from Middle Dutch , as seen in the names of many old cities . The first known appearance of dam occurs in 1165 . However , there is one village , Obdam , that is already mentioned in 1120 . The word seems to be related to the Greek word taphos , meaning grave or grave hill . [ citation needed ] So the word should be understood as dike from dug out earth . The names of more than 40 places ( with minor changes ) from the Middle Dutch era ( 1150-1500 CE ) such as Amsterdam ( founded as 'Amstelredam ' in the late 12th century ) and Rotterdam , also bear testimony to the use of the word in Middle Dutch at that time .",

  "/wiki/Hydropower": "Hydropower or water power ( from Greek : \u1f55\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1 , water ) is power derived from the energy of falling or fast-running water , which may be harnessed for useful purposes . Since ancient times , hydropower from many kinds of watermills has been used as a renewable energy source for irrigation and the operation of various mechanical devices , such as gristmills , sawmills , textile mills , trip hammers , dock cranes , domestic lifts , and ore mills . A trompe , which produces compressed air from falling water , is sometimes used to power other machinery at a distance . In the late 19th century , hydropower became a source for generating electricity . Cragside in Northumberland was the first house powered by hydroelectricity in 1878 and the first commercial hydroelectric power plant was built at Niagara Falls in 1879 . In 1881 , street lamps in the city of Niagara Falls were powered by hydropower . Since the early 20th century , the term has been used almost exclusively in conjunction with the modern development of hydroelectric power . International institutions such as the World Bank view hydropower as a means for economic development without adding substantial amounts of carbon to the atmosphere , but dams can have significant negative social and environmental impacts .",

Most fishways enable fish to pass around the barriers by swimming and leaping up a series of relatively low steps ( hence the term ladder ) into the waters on the other side . The velocity of water falling over the steps has to be great enough to attract the fish to the ladder , but it can not be so great that it washes fish back downstream or exhausts them to the point of inability to continue their journey upriver .",

The historic roadway was bypassed by the present Columbia River Highway No . 2 ( Interstate 84 ) from the 1930s to the 1950s , leaving behind the old two-lane road . The road is now mostly owned and maintained by the state through the Oregon Department of Transportation as the Historic Columbia River Highway No . 100 ( still partially marked as U.S. Route 30 ; see Oregon highways and routes ) or the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department as the Historic Columbia River Highway State Trail . The original highway was promoted by lawyer and entrepreneur Sam Hill and engineer Samuel C. Lancaster , to be modeled after the great scenic roads of Europe . From the very beginning , the roadway was envisioned not just as means of traveling by the then popular Model T , but designed with an elegance that took full advantage of all the natural beauty along the route . When the United States highway system was officially established in 1926 , the highway became the part of U.S. Route 30 .

  "/wiki/Modernism": "Modernism is both a philosophical movement and an art movement that , along with cultural trends and changes , arose from wide-scale and far-reaching transformations in Western society during the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Among the factors that shaped modernism were the development of modern industrial societies and the rapid growth of cities , followed then by reactions to the horrors of World War I. Modernism also rejected the certainty of Enlightenment thinking , although many modernists also rejected religious belief . Modernism , in general , includes the activities and creations of those who felt the traditional forms of art , architecture , literature , religious faith , philosophy , social organization , activities of daily life , and sciences were becoming ill-fitted to their tasks and outdated in the new economic , social , and political environment of an emerging fully industrialized world . The poet Ezra Pound 's 1934 injunction to Make it new ! was the touchstone of the movement 's approach towards what it saw as the now obsolete culture of the past . In this spirit , its innovations , like the stream-of-consciousness novel , atonal ( or pantonal ) and twelve-tone music , divisionist painting and abstract art , all had precursors in the 19th century . A notable characteristic of modernism is self-consciousness and irony concerning literary and social traditions , which often led to experiments with form , along with the use of techniques that drew attention to the processes and materials used in creating a painting , poem , building and other works of art . Modernism explicitly rejected the ideology of realism [ full citation needed ] and made use of the works of the past by the employment of reprise , incorporation , rewriting , recapitulation , revision and parody .

The lake is 1,949 feet ( 594 m ) deep at its deepest point , which makes it the deepest lake in the United States , the second-deepest in North America and the ninth-deepest in the world . Crater Lake is often referred to as the seventh-deepest lake in the world , but this former listing excludes the approximately 3,000-foot ( 910 m ) depth of subglacial Lake Vostok in Antarctica , which resides under nearly 13,000 feet ( 4,000 m ) of ice , and the recent report of a 2,740-foot ( 840 m ) maximum depth for Lake O'Higgins/San Martin , located on the border of Chile and Argentina . However , when comparing its average depth of 1,148 feet ( 350 m ) to the average depth of other deep lakes , Crater Lake becomes the deepest in the Western Hemisphere and the third-deepest in the world . The impressive average depth of this volcanic lake is due to the nearly symmetrical 4,000-foot-deep ( 1,200 m ) caldera formed 7,700 years ago during the violent climactic eruptions and subsequent collapse of Mount Mazama and the relatively moist climate that is typical of the crest of the Cascade Range .

  "/wiki/National_Park_Service_Rustic": "National Park Service rustic - sometimes colloquially called Parkitecture - is a style of architecture that developed in the early and middle 20th century in the United States National Park Service ( NPS ) through its efforts to create buildings that harmonized with the natural environment . Since its founding in 1916 , the NPS sought to design and build visitor facilities without visually interrupting the natural or historic surroundings . The early results were characterized by intensive use of hand labor and a rejection of the regularity and symmetry of the industrial world , reflecting connections with the Arts and Crafts movement and American Picturesque architecture . Architects , landscape architects and engineers combined native wood and stone with convincingly native styles to create visually appealing structures that seemed to fit naturally within the majestic landscapes . Examples of the style can be found in numerous types of National Park structures , including entrance gateways , hotels and lodges , park roads and bridges , visitor centers , trail shelters , informational kiosks , and even mundane maintenance and support facilities . Many of these buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places .",
  "/wiki/National_park": "A national park is a park in use for conservation purposes . Often it is a reserve of natural , semi-natural , or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns . Although individual nations designate their own national parks differently , there is a common idea : the conservation of 'wild nature ' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride . An international organization , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , and its World Commission on Protected Areas ( WCPA ) , has defined National Park as its Category II type of protected areas . According to the IUCN , 6,555 national parks worldwide met its criteria in 2006 . IUCN is still discussing the parameters of defining a national park . While this type of national park had been proposed previously , the United States established the first public park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people , Yellowstone National Park , in 1872 . Although Yellowstone was not officially termed a national park in its establishing law , it was always termed such in practice and is widely held to be the first and oldest national park in the world . However , the Tobago Main Ridge Forest Reserve ( established in 1776 ) , and the area surrounding Bogd Khan Uul Mountain ( 1778 ) are seen as the oldest legally protected areas , predating Yellowstone by nearly a century . National parks are almost always open to visitors .",
  "/wiki/Building": "A building , or edifice , is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place , such as a house or factory . Buildings come in a variety of sizes , shapes , and functions , and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors , from building materials available , to weather conditions , land prices , ground conditions , specific uses , and aesthetic reasons . To better understand the term building compare the list of nonbuilding structures . Buildings serve several societal needs - primarily as shelter from weather , security , living space , privacy , to store belongings , and to comfortably live and work . A building as a shelter represents a physical division of the human habitat ( a place of comfort and safety ) and the outside ( a place that at times may be harsh and harmful ) . Ever since the first cave paintings , buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression . In recent years , interest in sustainable planning and building practices has also become an intentional part of the design process of many new buildings .",

The lake partly fills a nearly 2,148-foot ( 655 m ) -deep caldera that was formed around 7,700 ( \u00b1 150 ) years ago by the collapse of the volcano Mount Mazama . There are no rivers flowing into or out of the lake ; the evaporation is compensated for by rain and snowfall at a rate such that the total amount of water is replaced every 250 years . With a depth of 1,949 feet ( 594 m ) , the lake is the deepest in the United States . In the world , it ranks ninth for maximum depth , and third for mean ( average ) depth . Crater Lake features two small islands . Wizard Island , located near the western shore of the lake , is a cinder cone approximately 316 acres ( 128 ha ) in size . Phantom Ship , a natural rock pillar , is located near the southern shore . Since 2002 , one of the state 's regular-issue license plate designs has featured Crater Lake and a one-time plate surcharge is used to support the operation of Crater Lake National Park . The commemorative Oregon State Quarter , which was released by the United States Mint in 2005 , features an image of Crater Lake on its reverse .

  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",
  "/wiki/Mansard_roof": "A mansard or mansard roof ( also called a French roof or curb roof ) is a four-sided gambrel-style hip roof characterized by two slopes on each of its sides with the lower slope , punctured by dormer windows , at a steeper angle than the upper . The steep roof with windows creates an additional floor of habitable space ( a garret ) , and reduces the overall height of the roof for a given number of habitable stories . The upper slope of the roof may not be visible from street level when viewed from close proximity to the building . The earliest known example of a mansard roof is credited to Pierre Lescot on part of the Louvre built around 1550 . This roof design was popularized in the early 17th century by Fran\u00e7ois Mansart ( 1598-1666 ) , an accomplished architect of the French Baroque period . It became especially fashionable during the Second French Empire ( 1852-1870 ) of Napol\u00e9on III . Mansard in Europe ( France , Germany and elsewhere ) also means the attic or garret space itself , not just the roof shape and is often used in Europe to mean a gambrel roof .",
  "/wiki/Roof": "A roof is the top covering of a building , including all materials and constructions necessary to support it on the walls of the building or on uprights ; it provides protection against rain , snow , sunlight , extremes of temperature , and wind . A roof is part of the building envelope . The characteristics of a roof are dependent upon the purpose of the building that it covers , the available roofing materials and the local traditions of construction and wider concepts of architectural design and practice and may also be governed by local or national legislation . In most countries a roof protects primarily against rain . A verandah may be roofed with material that protects against sunlight but admits the other elements . The roof of a garden conservatory protects plants from cold , wind , and rain , but admits light . A roof may also provide additional living space , for example a roof garden .",

Towers are distinguished from masts by their lack of guy-wires and are therefore , along with tall buildings , self-supporting structures . Towers are specifically distinguished from buildings in that they are not built to be habitable but to serve other functions . The principal function is the use of their height to enable various functions to be achieved including : visibility of other features attached to the tower such as clock towers ; as part of a larger structure or device to increase the visibility of the surroundings for defensive purposes as in a fortified building such as a castle ; as a structure for observation for leisure purposes ; or as a structure for telecommunication purposes .

Built at the entrance of the Columbia River in 1811 , Fort Astoria was the first American-owned settlement on the Pacific coast . The inhabitants of the fort differed greatly in background and position , and were structured into a corporate hierarchy .

Nationalities included Scots , French-Canadian voyageurs , American , Native Hawaiian Kanaka , and people from various indigenous North American peoples , including Iroquois and others from Eastern Canada . They found life quite monotonous , with the fish and vegetable diet boring . Venereal diseases were problematic . Types of fur taken in trade at the fort included beaver , sea otter , squirrel , and red fox . The onset of the War of 1812 caused the PFC to fold , too isolated to expect any military protection or support from the United States .

  "/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland": "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was a sovereign state established by the Acts of Union 1800 , which merged the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland . The United Kingdom , having financed the European coalition that defeated France during the Napoleonic Wars , developed a large Royal Navy that enabled the British Empire to become the foremost world power for the next century . The Crimean War with Russia was a relatively small operation in a century where Britain was largely at peace with the Great Powers . Rapid industrialisation that began in the decades prior to the state 's formation continued up until the mid-19th century . The Great Irish Famine , exacerbated by government inaction in the mid-19th century , led to demographic collapse in much of Ireland and increased calls for Irish land reform . The 19th century was an era of rapid economic modernisation and growth of industry , trade and finance , in which Britain largely dominated the world economy . Outward migration was heavy to the principal British overseas possessions and to the United States . The empire was expanded into most parts of Africa and much of South Asia . The Colonial Office and India Office ruled through a small number of administrators who managed the units of the empire locally , while democratic institutions began to develop . British India , by far the most important overseas possession , saw a short-lived revolt in 1857 . In overseas policy , the central policy was free trade , which enabled British and Irish financiers and merchants to operate successfully in many otherwise independent countries , as in South America . London formed no permanent military alliances until the early 20th century , when it began to cooperate with Japan , France and Russia , and moved closer to the United States .",

This contrasts with a monopsony which relates to a single entity 's control of a market to purchase a good or service , and with oligopoly which consists of a few sellers dominating a market . Monopolies are thus characterized by a lack of economic competition to produce the good or service , a lack of viable substitute goods , and the possibility of a high monopoly price well above the seller 's marginal cost that leads to a high monopoly profit . The verb monopolise or monopolize refers to the process by which a company gains the ability to raise prices or exclude competitors . In economics , a monopoly is a single seller . In law , a monopoly is a business entity that has significant market power , that is , the power to charge overly high prices . Although monopolies may be big businesses , size is not a characteristic of a monopoly . A small business may still have the power to raise prices in a small industry ( or market ) .",
  "/wiki/Pacific_Northwest": "The Pacific Northwest ( PNW ) , sometimes referred to as Cascadia , is a geographic region in western North America bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and ( loosely ) by the Rocky Mountains on the east . Though no official boundary exists , the most common conception includes the Canadian province of British Columbia ( BC ) and the U.S. states of Idaho , Oregon , and Washington . Broader conceptions reach north into Southeast Alaska and Yukon , south into northern California , and east to the Continental Divide to include Western Montana and parts of Wyoming . Narrower conceptions may be limited to the coastal areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains . The variety of definitions can be attributed to partially overlapping commonalities of the region 's history , culture , geography , society , and other factors . The Northwest Coast is the coastal region of the Pacific Northwest , and the Northwest Plateau ( also commonly known as the Interior in British Columbia and the Inland Northwest in the United States ) is the inland region . The term Pacific Northwest should not be confused with the Northwest Territory ( also known as the Great Northwest , a historical term in the United States ) or the Northwest Territories of Canada . The region 's largest metropolitan areas are Greater Seattle , Washington , with 3.8 million people ; Metro Vancouver , British Columbia , with 2.5 million people ; and Greater Portland , Oregon , with 2.4 million people . The culture of the Pacific Northwest is influenced by the Canada-United States border , which the United States and the United Kingdom established at a time when the region 's inhabitants were composed mostly of indigenous peoples . Two sections of the border - one along the 49th parallel south of British Columbia and one between the Alaska Panhandle and northern British Columbia - have left a great impact on the region . According to Canadian historian Ken Coates , the border has not merely influenced the Pacific Northwest - rather , the region 's history and character have been determined by the boundary .",
  "/wiki/Fur_trade": "The fur trade is a worldwide industry dealing in the acquisition and sale of animal fur . Since the establishment of a world fur market in the early modern period , furs of boreal , polar and cold temperate mammalian animals have been the most valued . Historically the trade stimulated the exploration and colonization of Siberia , northern North America , and the South Shetland and South Sandwich Islands . Today the importance of the fur trade has diminished ; it is based on pelts produced at fur farms and regulated fur-bearer trapping , but has become controversial . Animal rights organizations oppose the fur trade , citing that animals are brutally killed and sometimes skinned alive . Fur has been replaced in some clothing by synthetic imitations , for example , as in ruffs on hoods of parkas .",
  "/wiki/Fortification": "A fortification is a military construction or building designed for the defense of territories in warfare , and is also used to solidify rule in a region during peacetime . The term is derived from the Latin fortis ( strong ) and facere ( to make ) . From very early history to modern times , defensive walls have often been necessary for cities to survive in an ever-changing world of invasion and conquest . Some settlements in the Indus Valley Civilization were the first small cities to be fortified . In ancient Greece , large stone walls had been built in Mycenaean Greece , such as the ancient site of Mycenae ( famous for the huge stone blocks of its 'cyclopean ' walls ) . A Greek phrourion was a fortified collection of buildings used as a military garrison , and is the equivalent of the Roman castellum or English fortress . These constructions mainly served the purpose of a watch tower , to guard certain roads , passes , and borders . Though smaller than a real fortress , they acted as a border guard rather than a real strongpoint to watch and maintain the border . The art of setting out a military camp or constructing a fortification traditionally has been called castrametation since the time of the Roman legions . Fortification is usually divided into two branches : permanent fortification and field fortification . There is also an intermediate branch known as semi-permanent fortification . Castles are fortifications which are regarded as being distinct from the generic fort or fortress in that they are a residence of a monarch or noble and command a specific defensive territory .",

  "/wiki/Archaeologist": "Archaeology , or archeology , is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture . The archaeological record consists of artifacts , architecture , biofacts or ecofacts and cultural landscapes . Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities . In Europe it is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines , while in North America archaeology is a sub-field of anthropology . Archaeologists study human prehistory and history , from the development of the first stone tools at Lomekwi in East Africa 3.3 million years ago up until recent decades . Archaeology is distinct from palaeontology , which is the study of fossil remains . It is particularly important for learning about prehistoric societies , for whom there may be no written records to study . Prehistory includes over 99% of the human past , from the Paleolithic until the advent of literacy in societies across the world . Archaeology has various goals , which range from understanding culture history to reconstructing past lifeways to documenting and explaining changes in human societies through time . The discipline involves surveying , excavation and eventually analysis of data collected to learn more about the past . In broad scope , archaeology relies on cross-disciplinary research .

Manufacturing engineering or manufacturing process are the steps through which raw materials are transformed into a final product . The manufacturing process begins with the product design , and materials specification from which the product is made . These materials are then modified through manufacturing processes to become the required part . Modern manufacturing includes all intermediate processes required in the production and integration of a product 's components . Some industries , such as semiconductor and steel manufacturers use the term fabrication instead . The manufacturing sector is closely connected with engineering and industrial design . Examples of major manufacturers in North America include General Motors Corporation , General Electric , Procter & Gamble , General Dynamics , Boeing , Pfizer , and Precision Castparts . Examples in Europe include Volkswagen Group , Siemens , FCA and Michelin . Examples in Asia include Toyota , Yamaha , Panasonic , LG , Samsung and Tata Motors .",
  "/wiki/Artifact_(archaeology)": "An artifact , [ a ] or artefact ( see American and British English spelling differences ) , is something made or given shape by humans , such as a tool or a work of art , especially an object of archaeological interest . In archaeology the word has become a term of particular nuance and is defined as , an object recovered by archaeological endeavor , which may be a cultural artifact having cultural interest . Modern archaeologists take care to distinguish material culture from ethnicity , which is often more complex , as expressed by Carol Kramer in the dictum pots are not people .",
  "/wiki/Americas": "The Americas ( also collectively called America ; French : Am\u00e9rique , Dutch : Amerika , Spanish and Portuguese : Am\u00e9rica ) comprise the totality of the continents of North and South America . Together , they make up most of the land in Earth 's western hemisphere and comprise the New World . Along with their associated islands , they cover 8% of Earth 's total surface area and 28.4% of its land area . The topography is dominated by the American Cordillera , a long chain of mountains that runs the length of the west coast . The flatter eastern side of the Americas is dominated by large river basins , such as the Amazon , St. Lawrence River / Great Lakes basin , Mississippi , and La Plata . Since the Americas extend 14,000 km ( 8,700 mi ) from north to south , the climate and ecology vary widely , from the arctic tundra of Northern Canada , Greenland , and Alaska , to the tropical rain forests in Central America and South America . Humans first settled the Americas from Asia between 42,000 and 17,000 years ago . A second migration of Na-Dene speakers followed later from Asia . The subsequent migration of the Inuit into the neoarctic around 3500 BCE completed what is generally regarded as the settlement by the indigenous peoples of the Americas . The first known European settlement in the Americas was by the Norse explorer Leif Erikson . However , the colonization never became permanent and was later abandoned . The Spanish voyages of Christopher Columbus from 1492 to 1502 resulted in permanent contact with European ( and subsequently , other Old World ) powers , which eventually led to the Columbian exchange and inaugurated a period of exploration , conquest , and colonization whose effects and consequences persist to the present .",
  "/wiki/Weaving": "Weaving is a method of textile production in which two distinct sets of yarns or threads are interlaced at right angles to form a fabric or cloth . Other methods are knitting , crocheting , felting , and braiding or plaiting . The longitudinal threads are called the warp and the lateral threads are the weft or filling . ( Weft is an old English word meaning that which is woven ; compare leave and left . [ a ] ) The method in which these threads are inter-woven affects the characteristics of the cloth . Cloth is usually woven on a loom , a device that holds the warp threads in place while filling threads are woven through them . A fabric band which meets this definition of cloth ( warp threads with a weft thread winding between ) can also be made using other methods , including tablet weaving , back strap loom , or other techniques without looms . The way the warp and filling threads interlace with each other is called the weave . The majority of woven products are created with one of three basic weaves : plain weave , satin weave , or twill . Woven cloth can be plain ( in one colour or a simple pattern ) , or can be woven in decorative or artistic design .",
  "/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas": "The indigenous peoples of the Americas are the pre-Columbian peoples of North , Central and South America and their descendants . Although some indigenous peoples of the Americas were traditionally hunter-gatherers - and many , especially in the Amazon basin , still are - many groups practiced aquaculture and agriculture . The impact of their agricultural endowment to the world is a testament to their time and work in reshaping and cultivating the flora indigenous to the Americas . Although some societies depended heavily on agriculture , others practiced a mix of farming , hunting and gathering . In some regions the indigenous peoples created monumental architecture , large-scale organized cities , city-states , chiefdoms , states , kingdoms and empires . Among these are the Aztec , Inca and Maya states that until the 16th century were among the most politically and socially advanced nations in the world . They had a vast knowledge of engineering , architecture , mathematics , astronomy , writing , physics , medicine , planting and irrigation , geology , mining , sculpture and goldsmithing . Many parts of the Americas are still populated by indigenous peoples ; some countries have sizable populations , especially Belize , Bolivia , Canada , Chile , Ecuador , Greenland , Guatemala , Mexico , Panama , Paraguay , Peru and the United States . At least a thousand different indigenous languages are spoken in the Americas . Some , such as the Quechuan languages , Aymara , Guaran\u00ed , Mayan languages and Nahuatl , count their speakers in millions . Many also maintain aspects of indigenous cultural practices to varying degrees , including religion , social organization and subsistence practices . Like most cultures , over time , cultures specific to many indigenous peoples have evolved to incorporate traditional aspects but also cater to modern needs .",
  "/wiki/Upper_Paleolithic": "The Upper Paleolithic ( or Upper Palaeolithic , Late Stone Age ) is the third and last subdivision of the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age . Very broadly , it dates to between 50,000 and 10,000 years ago ( the beginning of the Holocene ) , according to some theories coinciding with the appearance of behavioral modernity in early modern humans , until the advent of the Neolithic Revolution and agriculture . Anatomically modern humans ( i.e . Homo sapiens ) are believed to have emerged out of Africa around 200,000 years ago , although these lifestyles changed very little from that of archaic humans of the Middle Paleolithic , until about 50,000 years ago , when there was a marked increase in the diversity of artefacts . This period coincides with the expansion of modern humans from Africa throughout Asia and Eurasia , which contributed to the extinction of the Neanderthals . The Upper Paleolithic has the earliest known evidence of organized settlements , in the form of campsites , some with storage pits . Artistic work blossomed , with cave painting , petroglyphs , carvings and engravings on bone or ivory . The first evidence of human fishing is also found , from artefacts in places such as Blombos cave in South Africa . More complex social groupings emerged , supported by more varied and reliable food sources and specialized tool types . This probably contributed to increasing group identification or ethnicity . The peopling of Australia most likely took place before c. 60 ka . Europe was peopled after c. 45 ka .",
  "/wiki/Common_Era": "Common Era ( CE ) is one of the notation systems for the world 's most widely used calendar era . BCE ( Before the Common Era or Before the Current Era ) is the era before CE . BCE and CE are alternatives to the Dionysian BC and AD system respectively . The Dionysian era distinguishes eras using AD ( anno Domini , in [ the ] year of [ the ] Lord ) and BC ( before Christ ) . Since the two notation systems are numerically equivalent , 2020 CE corresponds to AD 2020 and 400 BCE corresponds to 400 BC . [ a ] Both notations refer to the Gregorian calendar ( and its predecessor , the Julian calendar ) . The year-numbering system used by the Gregorian calendar is used throughout the world today , and is an international standard for civil calendars . The expression has been traced back to 1615 , when it first appeared in a book by Johannes Kepler as the Latin usage annus aerae nostrae vulgaris , and to 1635 in English as Vulgar [ b ] Era . The term Common Era can be found in English as early as 1708 , and became more widely used in the mid-19th century by Jewish religious scholars . In the later 20th century , the use of CE and BCE was popularized in academic and scientific publications as a culturally neutral term . It is also used by some authors and publishers who wish to emphasize sensitivity to non-Christians by not explicitly referencing Jesus as Christ and Dominus ( Lord ) through use of the abbreviation [ c ] AD .",

  "/wiki/Mining": "Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth , usually from an ore body , lode , vein , seam , reef or placer deposit . These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner . Ores recovered by mining include metals , coal , oil shale , gemstones , limestone , chalk , dimension stone , rock salt , potash , gravel , and clay . Mining is required to obtain any material that can not be grown through agricultural processes , or feasibly created artificially in a laboratory or factory . Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum , natural gas , or even water . Mining of stones and metal has been a human activity since pre-historic times . Modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies , analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine , extraction of the desired materials , and final reclamation of the land after the mine is closed . Mining operations usually create a negative environmental impact , both during the mining activity and after the mine has closed . Hence , most of the world 's nations have passed regulations to decrease the impact . Work safety has long been a concern as well , and modern practices have significantly improved safety in mines . Levels of metal recycling are generally low . Unless future end-of-life recycling rates are stepped up , some rare metals may become unavailable for use in a variety of consumer products .",

They can range from simple dwellings such as rudimentary huts of nomadic tribes and the improvised shacks in shantytowns to complex , fixed structures of wood , masonry , concrete or other materials containing plumbing , ventilation , and electrical systems . Houses use a range of different roofing systems to keep precipitation such as rain from getting into the dwelling space . Houses may have doors or locks to secure the dwelling space and protect its inhabitants and contents from burglars or other trespassers . Most conventional modern houses in Western cultures will contain one or more bedrooms and bathrooms , a kitchen or cooking area , and a living room . A house may have a separate dining room , or the eating area may be integrated into another room . Some large houses in North America have a recreation room . In traditional agriculture-oriented societies , domestic animals such as chickens or larger livestock ( like cattle ) may share part of the house with humans .

  "/wiki/Retailing": "Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to earn a profit . Retailers satisfy demand identified through a supply chain . The term retailer is typically applied where a service provider fills the small orders of many individuals , who are end-users , rather than large orders of a small number of wholesale , corporate or government clientele . Shopping generally refers to the act of buying products . Sometimes this is done to obtain final goods , including necessities such as food and clothing ; sometimes it takes place as a recreational activity . Recreational shopping often involves window shopping and browsing : it does not always result in a purchase . Retail markets and shops have a very ancient history , dating back to antiquity . Some of the earliest retailers were itinerant peddlers . Over the centuries , retail shops were transformed from little more than rude booths to the sophisticated shopping malls of the modern era . Most modern retailers typically make a variety of strategic level decisions including the type of store , the market to be served , the optimal product assortment , customer service , supporting services and the store 's overall market positioning . Once the strategic retail plan is in place , retailers devise the retail mix which includes product , price , place , promotion , personnel , and presentation .

  "/wiki/Herbalism": "Herbal medicine ( also herbalism ) is the study of botany and the use of medicinal plants . Plants have been the basis for medical treatments through much of human history , and such traditional medicine is still widely practiced today . Modern medicine makes use of many plant-derived compounds as the basis for evidence-based pharmaceutical drugs . Although herbalism may apply modern standards of effectiveness testing to herbs and medicines derived from natural sources , few high-quality clinical trials and standards for purity or dosage exist . The scope of herbal medicine is sometimes extended to include fungal and bee products , as well as minerals , shells and certain animal parts . Herbal medicine is also called phytomedicine or phytotherapy . Paraherbalism describes alternative and pseudoscientific practices of using unrefined plant or animal extracts as unproven medicines or health-promoting agents . Paraherbalism differs from plant-derived medicines in standard pharmacology because it does not isolate or standardize biologically active compounds , but rather relies on the belief that preserving various substances from a given source with less processing is safer or more effective - for which there is no evidence . Herbal dietary supplements most often fall under the phytotherapy category .",
  "/wiki/Immigration": "Immigration is the international movement of people to a destination country of which they are not natives or where they do not possess citizenship in order to settle or reside there , especially as permanent residents or naturalized citizens , or to take up employment as a migrant worker or temporarily as a foreign worker . As for economic effects , research suggests that migration is beneficial both to the receiving and sending countries . Research , with few exceptions , finds that immigration on average has positive economic effects on the native population , but is mixed as to whether low-skilled immigration adversely affects low-skilled natives . Studies show that the elimination of barriers to migration would have profound effects on world GDP , with estimates of gains ranging between 67 and 147 percent . Development economists argue that reducing barriers to labor mobility between developing countries and developed countries would be one of the most efficient tools of poverty reduction . The academic literature provides mixed findings for the relationship between immigration and crime worldwide , but finds for the United States that immigration either has no impact on the crime rate or that it reduces the crime rate . Research shows that country of origin matters for speed and depth of immigrant assimilation , but that there is considerable assimilation overall for both first- and second-generation immigrants . Research has found extensive evidence of discrimination against foreign born and minority populations in criminal justice , business , the economy , housing , health care , media , and politics in the United States and Europe .",

[ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country .

  "/wiki/Wildlife_management": "Wildlife management attempts to balance the needs of wildlife with the needs of people using the best available science . Wildlife management can include game keeping , wildlife conservation and pest control . Wildlife management draws on disciplines such as mathematics , chemistry , biology , ecology , climatology and geography to gain the best results . Wildlife conservation aims to halt the loss in the Earth 's biodiversity by taking into consideration ecological principles such as carrying capacity , disturbance and succession and environmental conditions such as physical geography , pedology and hydrology . Most wildlife biologists are concerned with the preservation and improvement of habitats although rewilding is increasingly being used . Techniques can include reforestation , pest control , nitrification and denitrification , irrigation , coppicing and hedge laying . Game keeping is the management or control of wildlife for the well-being of game and may include the killing of other animals which share the same niche or predators to maintain a high population of more profitable species , such as pheasants introduced into woodland . In his 1933 book Game Management , Aldo Leopold , one of the pioneers of wildlife management as a science , defined it as the art of making land produce sustained annual crops of wild game for recreational use . Pest control is the control of real or perceived pests and can be used for the benefit of wildlife , farmers , game keepers or human safety . In the United States , wildlife management practices are often implemented by a governmental agency to uphold a law , such as the Endangered Species Act . In the United Kingdom , wildlife management is undertaken by several organizations including government bodies such as the Forestry Commission , Charities such as the RSPB and The Wildlife Trusts and privately hired gamekeepers and contractors . Legislation has also been passed to protect wildlife such as the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 .",

In Oregon , the watershed typically lies east of the Cascade Range , while California contains most of the river 's segment that passes through the mountains . In the Oregon-far northern California segment of the river , the watershed is semi-desert at lower elevations and dry alpine in the upper elevations . In the western part of the basin , in California , however , the climate is more of temperate rainforest , and the Trinity River watershed consists of a more typical alpine climate .",
  "/wiki/Water_reclamation": "Reclaimed or recycled water ( also called wastewater reuse or water reclamation ) is the process of converting wastewater into water that can be reused for other purposes . Reuse may include irrigation of gardens and agricultural fields or replenishing surface water and groundwater ( i.e. , groundwater recharge ) . Reused water may also be directed toward fulfilling certain needs in residences ( e.g . toilet flushing ) , businesses , and industry , and could even be treated to reach drinking water standards . This last option is called either direct potable reuse or indirect potable reuse , depending on the approach used . Colloquially , the term toilet to tap also refers to potable reuse . Reclaiming water for reuse applications instead of using freshwater supplies can be a water-saving measure . When used water is eventually discharged back into natural water sources , it can still have benefits to ecosystems , improving streamflow , nourishing plant life and recharging aquifers , as part of the natural water cycle . Wastewater reuse is a long-established practice used for irrigation , especially in arid countries . Reusing wastewater as part of sustainable water management allows water to remain as an alternative water source for human activities . This can reduce scarcity and alleviate pressures on groundwater and other natural water bodies .",
  "/wiki/Conservation_movement": "The conservation movement , also known as nature conservation , is a political , environmental , and social movement that seeks to protect natural resources including animal and plant species as well as their habitat for the future . Evidence-based conservation seeks to use high quality scientific evidence to make conservation efforts more effective . The early conservation movement included fisheries and wildlife management , water , soil conservation , and sustainable forestry . The contemporary conservation movement has broadened from the early movement 's emphasis on use of sustainable yield of natural resources and preservation of wilderness areas to include preservation of biodiversity . Some say the conservation movement is part of the broader and more far-reaching environmental movement , while others argue that they differ both in ideology and practice . Chiefly in the United States , conservation is seen as differing from environmentalism in that it aims to preserve natural resources expressly for their continued sustainable use by humans . Outside the U.S. the term conservation more broadly includes environmentalism .",
  "/wiki/Economy": "An economy ( from Greek \u03bf\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 - household and \u03bd\u03ad\u03bco\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 - manage ) is an area of the production , distribution and trade , as well as consumption of goods and services by different agents . Understood in its broadest sense , 'The economy is defined as a social domain that emphasize the practices , discourses , and material expressions associated with the production , use , and management of resources ' . Economic agents can be individuals , businesses , organizations , or governments . Economic transactions occur when two groups or parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service , commonly expressed in a certain currency . However , monetary transactions only account for a small part of the economic domain . Economic activity is spurred by production which uses natural resources , labor and capital . It has changed over time due to technology ( automation , accelerator of process , reduction of cost functions ) , innovation ( new products , services , processes , expanding markets , diversification of markets , niche markets , increases revenue functions ) such as , that which produces intellectual property and changes in industrial relations ( most notably child labor being replaced in some parts of the world with universal access to education ) . A given economy is the result of a set of processes that involves its culture , values , education , technological evolution , history , social organization , political structure and legal systems , as well as its geography , natural resource endowment , and ecology , as main factors . These factors give context , content , and set the conditions and parameters in which an economy functions . In other words , the economic domain is a social domain of human practices and transactions . It does not stand alone . A market-based economy is one where goods and services are produced and exchanged according to demand and supply between participants ( economic agents ) by barter or a medium of exchange with a credit or debit value accepted within the network , such as a unit of currency .",

The 4,554-acre ( 1,843 ha ) park , including the marble cave , is 20 miles ( 32 km ) east of Cave Junction , on Oregon Route 46 . The protected area , managed by the National Park Service ( NPS ) , is in southwestern Josephine County , near the Oregon-California border . Elijah Davidson , a resident of nearby Williams , discovered the cave in 1874 . Over the next two decades , private investors failed in efforts to run successful tourist ventures at the publicly owned site . After passage of the Antiquities Act by the United States Congress , in 1909 President William Howard Taft established Oregon Caves National Monument , to be managed by the United States Forest Service ( USFS ) . The growing popularity of the automobile , construction of paved highways , and promotion of tourism by boosters from Grants Pass led to large increases in cave visitation during the late 1920s and thereafter . Among the attractions at the remote monument is the Oregon Caves Chateau , a six-story hotel built in a rustic style in 1934 . It is a National Historic Landmark and is part of the Oregon Caves Historic District within the monument . The NPS , which assumed control of the monument in 1933 , offers tours of the cave from mid-April through early November . In 2014 , the protected area was expanded by about 4,000 acres ( 1,600 ha ) and re-designated a National Monument and Preserve .

Retaining walls are structures designed to restrain soil to a slope that it would not naturally keep to ( typically a steep , near-vertical or vertical slope ) . They are used to bound soils between two different elevations often in areas of terrain possessing undesirable slopes or in areas where the landscape needs to be shaped severely and engineered for more specific purposes like hillside farming or roadway overpasses . A retaining wall that retains soil on the backside and water on the frontside is called a seawall or a bulkhead .",
  "/wiki/Pond": "The technical distinction between a pond and a lake has not been universally standardized . Limnologists and freshwater biologists have proposed formal definitions for pond , in part to include 'bodies of water where light penetrates to the bottom of the waterbody , ' 'bodies of water shallow enough for rooted water plants to grow throughout , ' and 'bodies of water which lack wave action on the shoreline . ' Each of these definitions has met with resistance or disapproval , as the defining characteristics are each difficult to measure or verify . Accordingly , some organizations and researchers have settled on technical definitions of pond and lake that rely on size alone . Even among organizations and researchers who distinguish lakes from ponds by size alone , there is no universally recognised standard for the maximum size of a pond . The international Ramsar wetland convention sets the upper limit for pond size as 8 hectares ( 20 acres ) , but biologists have not universally adopted this convention . Researchers for the British charity Pond Conservation have defined a pond to be ' a man-made or natural waterbody that is between 1 m2 and 20,000 m2 in area ( 2 ha or ~5 acres ) , which holds water for four months of the year or more . ' Other European biologists have set the upper size limit at 5 ha ( 12 acres ) . In practice , a body of water is called a pond or a lake on an individual basis , as conventions change from place to place and over time . In North America , even larger bodies of water have been called ponds ; for example , Crystal Lake at 33 acres ( 13 ha ) , Walden Pond in Concord , Massachusetts at 61 acres ( 25 ha ) , and nearby Spot Pond at 340 acres ( 140 ha ) . There are numerous examples in other states , where bodies of water less than 10 acres ( 4.0 ha ) are being called lakes . As the case of Crystal Lake shows , marketing purposes can sometimes be the driving factor behind the categorization .",
  "/wiki/Canyon": "A canyon ( Spanish : ca\u00f1\u00f3n ; archaic British English spelling : ca\u00f1on ) or gorge is a deep cleft between escarpments or cliffs resulting from weathering and the erosive activity of a river over geologic timescales . Rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces , eventually wearing away rock layers as sediments are removed downstream . A river bed will gradually reach a baseline elevation , which is the same elevation as the body of water into which the river drains . The processes of weathering and erosion will form canyons when the river 's headwaters and estuary are at significantly different elevations , particularly through regions where softer rock layers are intermingled with harder layers more resistant to weathering . A canyon may also refer to a rift between two mountain peaks , such as those in ranges including the Rocky Mountains , the Alps , the Himalayas or the Andes . Usually a river or stream carve out such splits between mountains . Examples of mountain-type canyons are Provo Canyon in Utah or Yosemite Valley in California 's Sierra Nevada . Canyons within mountains , or gorges that have an opening on only one side , are called box canyons . Slot canyons are very narrow canyons that often have smooth walls . Steep-sided valleys in the seabed of the continental slope are referred to as submarine canyons . Unlike canyons on land , submarine canyons are thought to be formed by turbidity currents and landslides .",

  "/wiki/Custom_House": "A custom house or customs house was traditionally a building housing the offices for a jurisdictional government whose officials oversaw the functions associated with importing and exporting goods into and out of a country , such as collecting customs duty on imported goods . A custom house was typically located in a seaport or in a city on a major river , with access to an ocean . These cities acted as a port of entry into a country . As of 2019 [ update ] , the Custom House of Valletta in Malta is still used for its originally built purpose . Due to advances in electronic information systems , the increased volume of international trade , and the introduction of air travel , the term custom house became a historical anachronism .

It includes the Portland Skidmore/Old Town Historic District and the Portland New Chinatown/Japantown Historic District , which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places . It has been referred to as the skid row of Portland . In the Northwest section , NW Broadway forms the western boundary , separating it from the Pearl District , and W Burnside Street forms the southern boundary , separating it from Downtown Portland .

  "/wiki/Central_business_district": "A central business district ( CBD ) is the commercial and business center of a city . In larger cities , it is often synonymous with the city 's financial district . Geographically , it often coincides with the city centre or downtown , but the two concepts are separate : many cities have a central business district located away from its commercial or cultural city centre or downtown , or even several CBDs at once . In London , for example , the city centre is usually regarded as encompassing the historic City of London and the mediaeval City of Westminster , whereas the City of London and the transformed Docklands area are regarded as its two CBDs . In New York City , Midtown Manhattan is the largest central business district in the city and in the world ; yet Lower Manhattan , commonly called Downtown Manhattan , represents the second largest , and second , distinct CBD in New York City and is geographically situated south of Midtown . In Chicago , the Chicago Loop is the second largest central business district in the United States and is also referred to as the core of the city 's downtown . Mexico City also has a historic city centre , the colonial-era Centro Hist\u00f3rico , along with two CBDs : the mid-late 20th century Paseo de la Reforma - Polanco , and the new Santa Fe . The shape and type of a CBD almost always closely reflect the city 's history . Cities with strong preservation laws and maximum building height restrictions to retain the character of the historic and cultural core will have a CBD quite a distance from the centre of the city . This is quite common for European cities such as Paris or Vienna . In cities in the New World that grew quickly after the invention of mechanised modes such as road or rail transport , a single central area or downtown will often contain most of the region 's tallest buildings and act both as the CBD and the commercial and cultural city center . Increasing urbanisation in the 21st century have developed megacities , particularly in Asia , that will often have multiple CBDs scattered across the urban area .",

  "/wiki/Cast_iron": "Cast iron is a group of iron-carbon alloys with a carbon content greater than 2% . Its usefulness derives from its relatively low melting temperature . The alloy constituents affect its colour when fractured : white cast iron has carbide impurities which allow cracks to pass straight through , grey cast iron has graphite flakes which deflect a passing crack and initiate countless new cracks as the material breaks , and ductile cast iron has spherical graphite nodules which stop the crack from further progressing . Carbon ( C ) ranging from 1.8 to 4 wt% , and silicon ( Si ) 1-3 wt% , are the main alloying elements of cast iron . Iron alloys with lower carbon content are known as steel . Cast iron tends to be brittle , except for malleable cast irons . With its relatively low melting point , good fluidity , castability , excellent machinability , resistance to deformation and wear resistance , cast irons have become an engineering material with a wide range of applications and are used in pipes , machines and automotive industry parts , such as cylinder heads , cylinder blocks and gearbox cases . It is resistant to damage by oxidation . The earliest cast-iron artefacts date to the 5th century BC , and were discovered by archaeologists in what is now Jiangsu in China . Cast iron was used in ancient China for warfare , agriculture , and architecture . During the 15th century , cast iron became utilized for cannon in Burgundy , France , and in England during the Reformation . The amounts of cast iron used for cannon required large scale production .",

The Sauvie Island Bridge provides access across the Multnomah Channel from U.S. Route 30 and was completed in June 2008 , replacing the first bridge to connect the island to the mainland which was opened on 30 December 1950 . The island received the name Sauv\u00e9s Island after Laurent Sauv\u00e9 dit Laplante , a French-Canadian who managed a dairy for the Hudson 's Bay Company in the 1830s and 1840s . It is predominantly farmland and wildlife refuge and is a popular place for picking pumpkins , hunting geese and kayaking . There were 1,078 year-round residents at the 2000 census . There is an industrial zone and small grocery store in the southeast corner , near the bridge . Bicyclists flock to the island because its flat topography and lengthy low-volume roads make it ideal for cycling .",
  "/wiki/Archaeology": "Archaeology , or archeology , is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture . The archaeological record consists of artifacts , architecture , biofacts or ecofacts and cultural landscapes . Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities . In Europe it is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines , while in North America archaeology is a sub-field of anthropology . Archaeologists study human prehistory and history , from the development of the first stone tools at Lomekwi in East Africa 3.3 million years ago up until recent decades . Archaeology is distinct from palaeontology , which is the study of fossil remains . It is particularly important for learning about prehistoric societies , for whom there may be no written records to study . Prehistory includes over 99% of the human past , from the Paleolithic until the advent of literacy in societies across the world . Archaeology has various goals , which range from understanding culture history to reconstructing past lifeways to documenting and explaining changes in human societies through time . The discipline involves surveying , excavation and eventually analysis of data collected to learn more about the past . In broad scope , archaeology relies on cross-disciplinary research . It draws upon anthropology , history , art history , classics , ethnology , geography , geology , literary history , linguistics , semiology , sociology , textual criticism , physics , information sciences , chemistry , statistics , paleoecology , paleography , paleontology , paleozoology , and paleobotany .",

  "/wiki/Hunter-gatherer": "A hunter-gatherer is a human living in a society in which most or all food is obtained by foraging ( collecting wild plants and pursuing wild animals ) . Hunter-gatherer societies stand in contrast to agricultural societies , which rely mainly on domesticated species . Hunting and gathering was humanity 's first and most successful adaptation , occupying at least 90 percent of human history . Following the invention of agriculture , hunter-gatherers who did not change have been displaced or conquered by farming or pastoralist groups in most parts of the world . Only a few contemporary societies are classified as hunter-gatherers , and many supplement their foraging activity with horticulture or pastoralism . Contrary to common misconception , hunter-gatherers are mostly well-fed , rather than starving .",
  "/wiki/Trade": "Trade involves the transfer of goods or services from one person or entity to another , often in exchange for money . Economists refer to a system or network that allows trade as a market . An early form of trade , barter , saw the direct exchange of goods and services for other goods and services . [ need quotation to verify ] Barter involves trading things without the use of money . When either bartering party started to involve precious metals , these gained symbolic as well as practical importance . [ citation needed ] Modern traders generally negotiate through a medium of exchange , such as money . As a result , buying can be separated from selling , or earning . The invention of money ( and later of credit , paper money and non-physical money ) greatly simplified and promoted trade . Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade , while trade involving more than two traders is called multilateral trade . In one modern view , trade exists due to specialization and the division of labor , a predominant form of economic activity in which individuals and groups concentrate on a small aspect of production , but use their output in trades for other products and needs . Trade exists between regions because different regions may have a comparative advantage ( perceived or real ) in the production of some trade-able commodity - including production of natural resources scarce or limited elsewhere . For example : different regions ' sizes may encourage mass production .",

  "/wiki/Indigenous_peoples": "Indigenous peoples , also known in some regions as First peoples , First Nations , Aboriginal peoples or Native peoples , or autochthonous peoples , are ethnic groups who are the original or earliest known inhabitants of an area , in contrast to groups that have settled , occupied or colonized the area more recently . Groups are usually described as indigenous when they maintain traditions or other aspects of an early culture that is associated with a given region . Not all indigenous peoples share this characteristic , as many have adopted substantial elements of a colonizing culture , such as dress , religion or language . Indigenous peoples may be settled in a given region ( sedentary ) or exhibit a nomadic lifestyle across a large territory , but they are generally historically associated with a specific territory on which they depend . Indigenous societies are found in every inhabited climate zone and continent of the world except Antarctica . Since indigenous peoples are often faced with threats to their sovereignty , economic well-being and access to the resources on which their cultures depend , political rights have been set forth in international law by international organizations such as the United Nations , the International Labour Organization and the World Bank . In 2007 , the United Nations issued a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples ( UNDRIP ) to guide member-state national policies to the collective rights of indigenous peoples , such as culture , identity , language and access to employment , health , education and natural resources . Estimates put the total population of indigenous peoples from 220 million to 350 million . International Day of the World 's Indigenous Peoples is celebrated on 9 August each year .",
  "/wiki/Erosion": "In earth science , erosion is the action of surface processes ( such as water flow or wind ) that removes soil , rock , or dissolved material from one location on the Earth 's crust , and then transports it to another location ( not to be confused with weathering which involves no movement ) . This natural process is caused by the dynamic activity of erosive agents , that is , water , ice ( glaciers ) , snow , air ( wind ) , plants , animals , and humans . In accordance with these agents , erosion is sometimes divided into water erosion , glacial erosion , snow erosion , wind ( aeolic ) erosion , zoogenic erosion , and anthropogenic erosion . The particulate breakdown of rock or soil into clastic sediment is referred to as physical or mechanical erosion ; this contrasts with chemical erosion , where soil or rock material is removed from an area by its dissolving into a solvent ( typically water ) , followed by the flow away of that solution . Eroded sediment or solutes may be transported just a few millimetres , or for thousands of kilometres . Natural rates of erosion are controlled by the action of geological weathering geomorphic drivers , such as rainfall ; bedrock wear in rivers ; coastal erosion by the sea and waves ; glacial plucking , abrasion , and scour ; areal flooding ; wind abrasion ; groundwater processes ; and mass movement processes in steep landscapes like landslides and debris flows . The rates at which such processes act control how fast a surface is eroded . Typically , physical erosion proceeds fastest on steeply sloping surfaces , and rates may also be sensitive to some climatically-controlled properties including amounts of water supplied ( e.g. , by rain ) , storminess , wind speed , wave fetch , or atmospheric temperature ( especially for some ice-related processes ) . Feedbacks are also possible between rates of erosion and the amount of eroded material that is already carried by , for example , a river or glacier . Processes of erosion that produce sediment or solutes from a place contrast with those of deposition , which control the arrival and emplacement of material at a new location . While erosion is a natural process , human activities have increased by 10-40 times the rate at which erosion is occurring globally . At well-known agriculture sites such as the Appalachian Mountains , intensive farming practices have caused erosion up to 100x the speed of the natural rate of erosion in the region .",

A member of the Democratic Party , he won a record four presidential elections and became a central figure in world events during the first half of the 20th century . Roosevelt directed the federal government during most of the Great Depression , implementing his New Deal domestic agenda in response to the worst economic crisis in U.S. history . As a dominant leader of his party , he built the New Deal Coalition , which realigned American politics into the Fifth Party System and defined American liberalism throughout the middle third of the 20th century .

Members of the Sahaptin language group , the Niim\u00edipuu were the dominant people of the Columbia Plateau for much of that time , especially after acquiring the horses that led them to breed the appaloosa horse in the 18th century . Prior to first contact with Western civilization the Nimiipuu were economically and culturally influential in trade and war , interacting with other indigenous nations in a vast network from the western shores of Oregon and Washington , the high plains of Montana , and the northern Great Basin in southern Idaho and northern Nevada . After first contact , the name Nez Perce was given to the Niim\u00edipuu and the nearby Chinook people by French explorers and trappers . The name means pierced nose , but only the Chinook used that form of decoration .

He succeeded his father Tuekakas ( Chief Joseph the Elder ) in the early 1870s . Chief Joseph led his band of Nez Perce during the most tumultuous period in their history , when they were forcibly removed by the United States federal government from their ancestral lands in the Wallowa Valley of northeastern Oregon onto a significantly reduced reservation in the Idaho Territory . A series of violent encounters with white settlers in the spring of 1877 culminated in those Nez Perce who resisted removal , including Joseph 's band and an allied band of the Palouse tribe , to flee the United States in an attempt to reach political asylum alongside the Lakota people , who had sought refuge in Canada under the leadership of Sitting Bull . At least 700 men , women , and children led by Joseph and other Nez Perce chiefs were pursued by the U.S. Army under General Oliver O. Howard in a 1,170-mile ( 1,900 km ) fighting retreat known as the Nez Perce War . The skill with which the Nez Perce fought and the manner in which they conducted themselves in the face of incredible adversity earned them widespread admiration from their military opponents and the American public , and coverage of the war in U.S. newspapers led to popular recognition of Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce . In October 1877 , after months of fugitive resistance , most of the surviving remnants of Joseph 's band were cornered in northern Montana Territory , just 40 miles ( 64 km ) from the Canadian border . Unable to fight any longer , Chief Joseph surrendered to the Army with the understanding that he and his people would be allowed to return to the reservation in western Idaho . He was instead transported between various forts and reservations on the southern Great Plains before being moved to the Colville Indian Reservation in the state of Washington , where he died in 1904 . Chief Joseph 's life remains iconic of the American Indian Wars . For his passionate , principled resistance to his tribe 's forced removal , Joseph became renowned as a humanitarian and peacemaker .",

The conflict , fought between June and October 1877 , stemmed from the refusal of several bands of the Nez Perce , dubbed non-treaty Indians , to give up their ancestral lands in the Pacific Northwest and move to an Indian reservation in Idaho . This forced removal was in violation of the 1855 Treaty of Walla Walla , which granted the tribe 7.5 million acres in their ancestral lands and the right to hunt and fish in lands ceded to the government . After the first armed engagements in June , the Nez Perce embarked on an arduous trek north initially to seek help with the Crow tribe . After the Crows ' refusal of aid , they sought sanctuary with the Lakota led by Sitting Bull , who had fled to Canada in May 1877 to avoid capture following the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn . The Nez Perce were pursued by elements of the U.S. Army with whom they fought a series of battles and skirmishes on a fighting retreat of 1,170 miles ( 1,880 km ) . The war ended after a final five-day battle fought alongside Snake Creek at the base of Montana 's Bears Paw Mountains only 40 miles ( 64 km ) from the Canada-US border . A large majority of the surviving Nez Perce represented by Chief Joseph of the Wallowa band of Nez Perce , surrendered to Brigadier Generals Oliver Otis Howard and Nelson A . Miles . White Bird , of the Lam\u00e1tta band of Nez Perce , managed to elude the Army after the battle and escape with an undetermined number of his band to Sitting Bull 's camp in Canada .

The Indian Removal Act , the key law that forced the removal of the Indians , was signed by Andrew Jackson in 1830 . Jackson took a hard line on Indian removal , but the law was put into effect primarily under the Martin van Buren administration . Indian removal was a consequence of actions first by European settlers to North America in the colonial period , then by the United States government and its citizens until the mid-20th century . The policy traced its direct origins to the administration of James Monroe , though it addressed conflicts between European Americans and Native Americans that had been occurring since the 17th century , and were escalating into the early 19th century as white settlers were continually pushing westward .",

Nevertheless , in 1863 , following a gold rush in Nez Perc\u00e9 territory , the federal government took back approximately 6 million acres ( 24,000 km2 ) of this land . That confined the Nez Perc\u00e9 to a 750,000-acre ( 3,000 km2 ) reservation in Idaho , which was only one tenth its previous size . Old Joseph argued that this second treaty was never approved by his people . Feeling deceived , Old Joseph condemned the United States , slashed his American flag , shredded his Bible , and declined to move his band from the Wallowa Valley or to sign the treaty that would make the new reservation boundaries legitimate . He was the father of Hinmahtoo-yahlatkekht , also known as Young Joseph or Chief Joseph .",
  "/wiki/Nez_Perce_National_Historical_Park": "The Nez Perce National Historical Park is a United States National Historical Park comprising 38 sites located throughout the states of Idaho , Montana , Oregon , and Washington , which included traditional aboriginal lands of the Nez Perce people . The sites are strongly associated with the resistance of Chief Joseph and his band , who in June 1877 took off from Oregon in an attempt to reach freedom in Canada and avoid being forced on to a reservation . They were pursued by U.S. Army cavalry forces and fought numerous skirmishes against them . The park was established in 1965 , and a museum was opened at the park headquarters in Spalding , Idaho , in 1983 . The 38 sites span three main ecoregions , covering a wide range of elevations and climate . Numerous animal species inhabit the park , including several that are considered sensitive .",

  "/wiki/International_style_(architecture)": "The International Style or internationalism is a major architectural style that was developed in the 1920s and 1930s and was closely related to modernism and modern architecture . It was first defined by Museum of Modern Art curators Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson in 1932 , based on works of architecture from the 1920s . The terms rationalist architecture and modern movement are often used interchangeably with International Style , although the former is mostly used in the English-speaking world to specifically refer to the Italian rationalism of architects such as Giuseppe Terragni and Gino Pollini , or even the International Style that developed in Europe as a whole . It is defined by the Getty Research Institute as the style of architecture that emerged in Holland , France , and Germany after World War I and spread throughout the world , becoming the dominant architectural style until the 1970s . The style is characterized by an emphasis on volume over mass , the use of lightweight , mass-produced , industrial materials , rejection of all ornament and colour , repetitive modular forms , and the use of flat surfaces , typically alternating with areas of glass ."
