  "/wiki/Major_General": "Major general ( abbreviated MG , maj. gen. and similar ) is a military rank used in many countries . It is derived from the older rank of sergeant major general . The disappearance of the sergeant in the title explains the apparently confusing phenomenon whereby a lieutenant general outranks a major general while a major outranks a lieutenant . In the Commonwealth and the United States , it is a division commander 's rank subordinate to the rank of lieutenant general and senior to the ranks of brigadier and brigadier general . In the Commonwealth , major general is equivalent to the navy rank of rear admiral , and in air forces with a separate rank structure , it is equivalent to air vice-marshal .

It was previously known as the North-West Frontier Province until 2010 when the name was changed to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by the 18th Amendment to Pakistan 's Constitution and is known colloquially by various other names . Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the third-largest province of Pakistan by the size of both population and economy , though it is geographically the smallest of four . Within Pakistan , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shares a border with Punjab , Balochistan , Azad Kashmir , Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad . It is home to 17.9% of Pakistan 's total population , with the majority of the province 's inhabitants being Pashtuns and Hindko speakers . The province is the site of the ancient kingdom Gandhara , including the ruins of its capital Pushkalavati near modern-day Charsadda . Originally a stronghold of Buddhism , the history of the region was characterized by frequent invasions by various empires due to its geographical proximity to the Khyber Pass . Since the 9/11 attacks in the United States in 2001 , the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been a major theatre of militancy and terrorism which intensified when the Taliban began an unsuccessful attempt to seize the control of the province in 2004 . With the launch of Operation Zarb-e-Azb against the Taliban insurgency , the casualty and crime rates in the country as a whole dropped by 40.0% as compared to 2011-13 , with even greater drops noted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas . As of July 2014 , about 929,859 people were reported to be internally displaced from North Waziristan to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as a result of Operation Zarb-e-Azb . On March 2 , 2017 , the Government of Pakistan considered a proposal to merge the Federally Administered Tribal Areas with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , and to repeal the Frontier Crimes Regulations , which are currently applicable to the tribal areas . However , some political parties have opposed the merger , and called for the tribal areas to instead become a separate province of Pakistan .",

The popular demonstrations and labour strikes which were supported by the protests in East Pakistan ultimately led to his forced resignation in 1969 . Trained at the British Royal Military College , Ayub Khan fought in World War II as a colonel in the British Indian Army before deciding to transfer to join the Pakistan Army as an aftermath of partition of British India in 1947 . His command assignment included his role as commander of the 14th Division in East-Bengal and elevated as the first native Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army in 1951 by then-Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan in a controversial promotion over several senior officers . From 1953 to 1958 , he served in the civilian government as Defence and Home Minister and supported President Iskander Mirza 's decision to impose martial law against Prime Minister Feroze Khan 's administration in 1958 . Two weeks later , he took over the presidency from Mirza after the meltdown of civil-military relations between the military and the civilian president . After appointing General Musa Khan as an army c-in-c in 1958 , the policy inclination towards the alliance with the United States was pursued that saw the allowance of American access to facilities inside Pakistan , most notably the airbase outside of Peshawar , from which spy missions over the Soviet Union were launched . Relations with neighboring China were strengthened but deteriorated with Soviet Union in 1962 , and with India in 1965 .

  "/wiki/Field_Marshal": "Field marshal ( or field-marshal , abbreviated as FM ) is a very senior military rank , ordinarily senior to the general officer ranks . Usually it is the highest rank in an army , and when it is , few ( if any ) persons are appointed to it . It is considered as a five-star rank ( OF-10 ) in modern-day armed forces in many countries . Promotion to the rank of field marshal in many countries historically required extraordinary military achievement by a general ( a wartime victory ) . However , the rank has also been used as a divisional command rank and also as a brigade command rank . Examples of the different uses of the rank include Austria-Hungary , Pakistan , Prussia/Germany , India and Sri Lanka for an extraordinary achievement ; Spain and Mexico for a divisional command ( Spanish : mariscal de campo ) ; and France , Portugal and Brazil for a brigade command ( French : mar\u00e9chal de camp , Portuguese : marechal de campo ) . The origin of the term dates to the early Middle Ages , originally meaning the keeper of the king 's horses ( from Old German Marh-scalc = horse-servant ) , from the time of the early Frankish kings . The exact wording of the titles used by field marshals varies : examples include marshal and field marshal general . The air force equivalent in Commonwealth and many Middle Eastern air forces is marshal of the air force ( not to be confused with air marshal ) . Navies , which usually do not use the nomenclature employed by armies or air forces , use titles such as fleet admiral , grand admiral or admiral of the fleet for the equivalent rank .

  "/wiki/Lieutenant_General": "Lieutenant general , lieutenant-general and similar ( abbrev Lt Gen , LTG and similar ) is a three-star military rank ( NATO code OF-8 ) used in many countries . The rank traces its origins to the Middle Ages , where the title of lieutenant general was held by the second in command on the battlefield , who was normally subordinate to a captain general . In modern armies , lieutenant general normally ranks immediately below general and above major general ; it is equivalent to the navy rank of vice admiral , and in air forces with a separate rank structure , it is equivalent to air marshal . A lieutenant general commands an army corps , made up of typically three army divisions , and consisting of around 60,000-70,000 soldiers ( U.S. ) . The seeming incongruity that a lieutenant general outranks a major general ( whereas a major outranks a lieutenant ) is due to the derivation of the former rank from sergeant major general , which was also subordinate to lieutenant general . In some countries ( e.g . France and Italy ) , the ranks of corps general or lieutenant colonel general are used instead of lieutenant general , in an attempt to solve this apparent anomaly - these ranks are often translated into English as lieutenant general . [ citation needed ] However , some countries of Latin America such as Brazil and Chile use divisional general as the equivalent of lieutenant general . In addition , because no brigadier general rank is used in Japan , lieutenant general is the rank of divisional commander . Therefore , it corresponds to divisional general of these countries . In a number of smaller states which employ NATO and western style military organizational structures , because of the limited number of soldiers in their armies , the rank of lieutenant general is the highest army rank in use .
