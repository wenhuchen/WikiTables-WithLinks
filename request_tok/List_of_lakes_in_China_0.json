Lying at the southeast end of the Dzungarian Gate , Ebi Lake is the center of the catchment of the southwestern part of the Dzungarian Basin . The lake previously covered over 1000 km2 ( 400 miles2 ) with an average depth of less than 2 meters ( 6.5 feet ) . In August 2007 , the Chinese government designated the adjoining Aibi Lake wetland as a National Nature Reserve . The high salt concentration ( 87 g/L ) of its water prevents plants and fish from living in the actual lake , though many kinds of fish do live in the mouths of its source rivers .

Being the largest province-level division of China and the 8th largest country subdivision in the world , Xinjiang spans over 1.6 million km2 ( 640,000 square miles ) . The Aksai Chin region , administered by China mostly as part of Xinjiang 's Hotan Prefecture , is claimed by India . Xinjiang borders the countries of Mongolia ( Bayan-\u00d6lgii , Khovd and Govi-Altai Provinces ) , Russia ( Altai Republic ) , Kazakhstan ( East Kazakhstan and Almaty Provinces ) , Kyrgyzstan ( Issyk Kul , Naryn and Osh Regions ) , Tajikistan ( Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region ) , Afghanistan ( Badakhshan Province ) , Pakistan ( Gilgit Baltistan ) and India ( Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir ) . The rugged Karakoram , Kunlun and Tian Shan mountain ranges occupy much of Xinjiang 's borders , as well as its western and southern regions . Xinjiang also borders the Tibet Autonomous Region and the provinces of Gansu and Qinghai . The most well-known route of the historical Silk Road ran through the territory from the east to its northwestern border . In recent decades , abundant oil and mineral reserves have been found in Xinjiang and it is currently China 's largest natural-gas-producing region . It is home to a number of ethnic groups , including the Uyghur , Han , Kazakhs , Tibetans , Hui , Tajiks , Kyrgyz , Mongols , Russians and Xibe . More than a dozen autonomous prefectures and counties for minorities are in Xinjiang . Older English-language reference works often refer to the area as Chinese Turkestan .

Administratively , the lake is situated within the Urho District of Karamay City , some 20 km south-east of the district 's main urban area .

As of 1999 , the lake 's water surface elevation was 273 metres ( 896 ft ) to 276 metres ( 906 ft ) above the sea level . Due to the construction of the Baiyang River Reservoir and the Huangyangquan Reservoir , and the concomitant diversion of the Baiyang River waters for irrigation , aquaculture , and other economic needs , the Ailik Lake started shrinking in the 1980s ; by the mid 1980s , it was just 15 km2 in size and hardly 1 meter deep ; by the 1990s , it had virtually dried up .

An active fishery exists on the lake . Until the early 1970s , two cyprinid species , Schizothorax biddulphi and Aspiorhynchus laticeps , the latter of which is endemic to Bosten Lake and the Yarkand River , were responsible for 80 percent of the annual catch . During the years 1962 to 1965 , various carp species ( bighead , black , silver , grass , common , and crucian carp ) were introduced into the lake . In the 1970s , these species become major targets of the fishing activities . Since 1978 , the introduced European perch has been the dominating species in the catches from Bosten Lake .",

The bulk of western and central Tibet ( \u00dc-Tsang ) was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa , Shigatse , or nearby locations ; these governments were at various times under Mongol and Chinese overlordship .
