As a Goidelic language , Scottish Gaelic , like Modern Irish and Manx , developed out of Old Irish . It became a distinct spoken language sometime in the 13th century in the Middle Irish period , although a common literary language was shared by Gaels in both Ireland and Scotland down to the 16th century . Most of modern Scotland was once Gaelic-speaking , as evidenced especially by Gaelic-language placenames . In the 2011 census of Scotland , 57,375 people ( 1.1% of the Scottish population aged over three years old ) reported as able to speak Gaelic , 1,275 fewer than in 2001 . The highest percentages of Gaelic speakers were in the Outer Hebrides . Nevertheless , there are revival efforts , and the number of speakers of the language under age 20 did not decrease between the 2001 and 2011 censuses . Outside Scotland , a dialect known as Canadian Gaelic has been spoken in eastern Canada since the 18th century . In the 2016 national census , nearly 4,000 Canadian residents claimed knowledge of Scottish Gaelic . Scottish Gaelic is not an official language of the United Kingdom . However , it is classed as an indigenous language under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages , which the British government has ratified , and the Gaelic Language ( Scotland ) Act 2005 established a language-development body , B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig .",

The language is closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon , and its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages , particularly Norse ( a North Germanic language ) , and to a greater extent by Latin and French . English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . The earliest forms of English , a group of West Germanic ( Ingvaeonic ) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century , are collectively called Old English . Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England ; this was a period in which the language was influenced by French . Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London , the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift . Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States . Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science , navigation and law . English is the largest language by number of speakers , and the third most-spoken native language in the world , after Standard Chinese and Spanish .

  "/wiki/North-West_Mounted_Police": "The North-West Mounted Police ( NWMP ) was a Canadian police force , established in 1873 by the Prime Minister , Sir John Macdonald , to maintain order in the North-West Territories . The mounted police combined military , police and judicial functions along similar lines to the Royal Irish Constabulary , and deployed the following year to the Alberta border in response to the Cypress Hills Massacre and subsequent fears of a United States military intervention . Their ill-planned and arduous journey of nearly 900 miles ( 1,400 km ) became known as the March West and was portrayed by the force as an epic journey of endurance . Over the next few years , the police extended Canadian law across the region , establishing good working relationships with the First Nations . The force formed part of the military response to the North-West Rebellion in 1885 , but faced criticism for their performance during the conflict . The mounted police assisted in the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway , including relocating indigenous communities living along the route . The force established a wide network of posts and patrols , enabling them to protect and assist the ranchers who created huge cattle businesses across the prairies . The living conditions of the police on the prairies were spartan and often uncomfortable , and only slowly improved over the course of the century . Meanwhile , the railway enabled more settlers to migrate west , creating new towns and industries , while the force restricted the First Nations to the reserves . The mounted police faced challenges in adapting to the changing situation , especially when applying the unpopular prohibition laws to the white community . The force also became drawn into the growing number of industrial disputes between organised labour and company owners . By 1896 , the government planned to pass policing responsibilities to the provincial authorities and ultimately close the force .",

  "/wiki/Wapiti": "The elk or wapiti ( Cervus canadensis ) is one of the largest species within the deer family , Cervidae , and one of the largest terrestrial mammals in North America and Northeast Asia . This animal should not be confused with the still larger Alces alces , known as the moose in America , but as the elk in British English and in reference to populations in Eurasia . Elk range in forest and forest-edge habitat , feeding on grasses , plants , leaves , and bark . Male elk have large antlers which are shed each year . Males also engage in ritualized mating behaviors during the rut , including posturing , antler wrestling ( sparring ) , and bugling , a loud series of vocalizations that establishes dominance over other males and attracts females . Although they are native to North America and eastern Asia , they have adapted well to countries in which they have been introduced , including Argentina and New Zealand . Their great adaptability may threaten endemic species and ecosystems into which they have been introduced . Elk are susceptible to a number of infectious diseases , some of which can be transmitted to livestock . Efforts to eliminate infectious diseases from elk populations , largely by vaccination , have had mixed success . Some cultures revere the elk as a spiritual force . In parts of Asia , antlers and their velvet are used in traditional medicines . Elk are hunted as a game species .",
  "/wiki/Red_deer": "The red deer ( Cervus elaphus ) is one of the largest deer species . The red deer inhabits most of Europe , the Caucasus Mountains region , Asia Minor , Iran , parts of western Asia , and central Asia . It also inhabits the Atlas Mountains region between Morocco and Tunisia in northwestern Africa , being the only species of deer to inhabit Africa . Red deer have been introduced to other areas , including Australia , New Zealand , United States , Canada , Peru , Uruguay , Chile and Argentina . In many parts of the world , the meat ( venison ) from red deer is used as a food source . Red deer are ruminants , characterized by a four-chambered stomach . Genetic evidence indicates the red deer as traditionally defined is a species group , rather than a single species , although it remains disputed as to exactly how many species the group includes . The closely related and slightly larger American elk or wapiti , native to North America and eastern parts of Asia , had been regarded as a subspecies of red deer , but recently it has been established as a distinct species . It is probable that the ancestor of all red deer , including wapiti , originated in central Asia and resembled sika deer . Although at one time red deer were rare in parts of Europe , they were never close to extinction . Reintroduction and conservation efforts , such as in the United Kingdom and Portugal , have resulted in an increase of red deer populations , while other areas , such as North Africa , have continued to show a population decline .",

  "/wiki/Spruce": "A spruce is a tree of the genus Picea /pa\u026a\u02c8si\u02d0\u0259/ , a genus of about 35 species of coniferous evergreen trees in the family Pinaceae , found in the northern temperate and boreal ( taiga ) regions of the Earth . Picea is the sole genus in the subfamily Piceoideae . Spruces are large trees , from about 20-60 m ( about 60-200 ft ) tall when mature , and have whorled branches and conical form . They can be distinguished from other members of the pine family by their needles ( leaves ) , which are four-sided and attached singly to small persistent peg-like structures ( pulvini or sterigmata ) on the branches , and by their cones ( without any protruding bracts ) , which hang downwards after they are pollinated . The needles are shed when 4-10 years old , leaving the branches rough with the retained pegs . In other similar genera , the branches are fairly smooth . Spruce are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera ( moth and butterfly ) species , such as the eastern spruce budworm . They are also used by the larvae of gall adelgids ( Adelges species ) . In the mountains of western Sweden , scientists have found a Norway spruce , nicknamed Old Tjikko , which by reproducing through layering , has reached an age of 9,550 years and is claimed to be the world 's oldest known living tree .",
