  "/wiki/Hungarian_Working_People's_Party": "The Hungarian Working People 's Party ( Hungarian : Magyar Dolgoz\u00f3k P\u00e1rtja , MDP ) was the ruling communist party of Hungary from 1948 to 1956 . It was formed by a merger of the Hungarian Communist Party ( MKP ) and the Hungarian Social Democratic Party . Ostensibly a union of equals , the merger had actually occurred as a result of massive pressure brought to bear on the Social Democrats by both the Hungarian Communists , as well as the Soviet Union . The few independent-minded Social Democrats who had not been sidelined by Communist salami tactics were pushed out in short order after the merger , leaving the party as essentially the MKP under a new name . Its leader was M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi until 1956 , then Ern\u0151 Ger\u0151 in the same year for three months , and eventually J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r until the party 's dissolution . Other minor legal Hungarian political parties were allowed to continue as independent coalition parties until late 1949 , but were completely subservient to the MDP . During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 , the party was reorganised into the Hungarian Socialist Workers ' Party ( MSZMP ) by a circle of communists around K\u00e1d\u00e1r and Imre Nagy . The new government of Nagy declared to assess the uprising not as counter-revolutionary but as a great , national and democratic event and to dissolve State Security Police ( \u00c1VH ) . Hungary 's declaration to become neutral and to exit the Warsaw Pact , caused the second Soviet intervention on 4 November 1956 . After 8 November 1956 , the MSZMP , under K\u00e1d\u00e1r 's leadership , fully supported the Soviet Union .",

Despite initially governing the Soviet Union as part of a collective leadership , he eventually consolidated power to become the country 's de facto dictator by the 1930s . A communist ideologically committed to the Leninist interpretation of Marxism , Stalin formalised these ideas as Marxism-Leninism , while his own policies are known as Stalinism . Born to a poor family in Gori in the Russian Empire ( now Georgia ) , Stalin joined the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party as a youth . He edited the party 's newspaper , Pravda , and raised funds for Vladimir Lenin 's Bolshevik faction via robberies , kidnappings , and protection rackets . Repeatedly arrested , he underwent several internal exiles . After the Bolsheviks seized power during the 1917 October Revolution and created a one-party state under Lenin 's newly renamed Communist Party , Stalin joined its governing Politburo . Serving in the Russian Civil War before overseeing the Soviet Union 's establishment in 1922 , Stalin assumed leadership over the country following Lenin 's 1924 death . Under Stalin , Socialism in One Country became a central tenet of the party 's dogma . Through the Five-Year Plans , the country underwent agricultural collectivisation and rapid industrialisation , creating a centralised command economy . This led to significant disruptions in food production that contributed to the famine of 1932-33 .",

  "/wiki/General_Secretary": "Secretary is a title often used in organizations to indicate a person having a certain amount of authority , power , or importance in the organization . Secretaries announce important events and communicate to the organization . The term is derived from the Latin word secernere , to distinguish or to set apart , the passive participle ( secretum ) meaning having been set apart , with the eventual connotation of something private or confidential , as with the English word secret . A secretarius was a person , therefore , overseeing business confidentially , usually for a powerful individual ( a king , pope , etc. ) . The official title of the leader of most communist and socialist political parties is the General Secretary of the Central Committee or First Secretary of the Central Committee . When a communist party is in power , the General Secretary is usually the country 's de facto leader ( though sometimes this leader also holds state-level positions to monopolize power , such as a presidency or premiership in order to constitute de jure leadership of the state ) , such as China and Cuba . In England , the term secretarius was used from the beginning of the thirteenth century in the varying meanings of a confidential clerk , an ambassador , or a member of the king 's council . In the fourteenth century , the title became strongly associated with the keeper of the king 's signet . From the Renaissance to the late 19th century , men involved in the daily correspondence and the activities of the powerful assumed the title of secretary . With time , like many titles , the term was applied to more and varied functions , leading to compound titles to specify the authority associated with its use , like general secretary or financial secretary . In some countries , such as the United States , the term secretary is used to indicate the holder of a cabinet-level post . There are a number of popular variations of the title used to indicate that the secretary in question has a high degree of authority , such as general secretary ( or , following usage in the Norman language , secretary-general ) , first secretary , and executive secretary .",

Under pressure from the Kremlin , all reforms were repealed , party leadership became taken over by its more authoritarian wing , and a massive non-bloody purge of party members was conducted . In 1989 , the party leadership bowed to popular pressure during the Velvet Revolution and agreed to call the first contested election since 1946 . In 1990 , the centre-based Civic Forum won the election and the Communist Party stood down . In November 1990 , the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia became a federation of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia and the Communist Party of Slovakia .

He gained further international attention as the chief leader of the Non-Aligned Movement , alongside Jawaharlal Nehru of India , Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt , and Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana . Broz was born to a Croat father and Slovene mother in the village of Kumrovec , Austria-Hungary ( now in Croatia ) . Drafted into military service , he distinguished himself , becoming the youngest sergeant major in the Austro-Hungarian Army of that time . After being seriously wounded and captured by the Imperial Russians during World War I , he was sent to a work camp in the Ural Mountains . He participated in some events of the Russian Revolution in 1917 and subsequent Civil War .

  "/wiki/Rudolf_Margolius": "Rudolf Margolius ( 31 August 1913 , Prague - 3 December 1952 , Prague ) was Deputy Minister for Foreign Trade , Czechoslovakia ( 1949-1952 ) , and a co-defendant in the Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd trial in November 1952 . Imprisoned by the Nazis in the Lodz ghetto and several concentration camps , he survived the Holocaust and joined the Czechoslovak Communist Party , working as an economist . The 1952 show trial involved the Communist Party General Secretary , Rudolf Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd , and his thirteen co-defendants . They were arrested , unjustly accused , tried , and executed as traitors and western spies . The trial was orchestrated by Soviet advisors , sent to Prague by Soviet premier Joseph Stalin , and assisted by Czechoslovak Secret Service interrogators and the members of Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee . The destruction of the Czechoslovak Communist high-ranking party officials by their own colleagues has defied attempts to rationalize it , and our understanding of the affair remains superficial . One of the people who were thrown into the alleged conspiracy was Dr Rudolf Margolius . The Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd group consisted of many personalities . On one side was Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd , an extremist and one of those who helped to usher Czechoslovakia into the Stalinist era . At the centre stood Vladim\u00edr Clementis ( Minister of Foreign Affairs ) , a Communist and one of the conductors of the February 1948 communist coup , but also a man who had dared to criticize the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact . On the other extreme of the scale was Margolius . Unlike others in the Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd group , he joined the Communist Party late - in December 1945 - and acquired faith in socialism as a result of his experience in Adolf Hitlers concentration camps and never held any Party appointments , he was purely an economist .",

Successor to the pro-Bolshevik wing of the Socialist Party of Romania , it gave ideological endorsement to a communist revolution to overthrow the Kingdom of Romania . The PCR was a minor and illegal grouping for much of the interwar period , and submitted to direct Comintern control . During the 1930s , most of its activists were imprisoned or took refuge in the Soviet Union , which led to the creation of separate and competing factions until the 1950s . The Communist Party emerged as a powerful actor on the Romanian political scene in August 1944 , when it became involved in the royal coup that toppled the pro-Nazi government of Ion Antonescu . With support from Soviet occupational forces , the PCR was able to force King Michael I into exile , and establish undisguised Communist rule in 1948 . The party operated under the title of Romanian Workers ' Party from 1948 until 1965 when it was officially renamed by Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu who had just been elected secretary general . From 1953 until 1989 , it was for all intents and purposes the only legally permitted party in the country . In 1947 , the Communist Party absorbed much of the Romanian Social Democratic Party , while attracting various new members .
