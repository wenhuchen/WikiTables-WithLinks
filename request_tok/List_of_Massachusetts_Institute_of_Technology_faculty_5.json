  "/wiki/Jack_Wisdom": "Jack Wisdom ( born 1953 ) is a Professor of Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . He received his B.S . from Rice University in 1976 and his Ph.D. from California Institute of Technology in 1981 . His research interests are the dynamics of the Solar System . Wisdom pioneered the study of chaos in the solar system . His 1981 dissertation demonstrated for the first time the theoretical reason for the clearing of the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt . His work has also brought to light the chaotic rotation of Hyperion , chaos in the orbital evolution of Pluto , and the chaotic obliquity of Mars which has important implications for the past Martian climate . Work with colleague Gerald Sussman using a specially-built computer demonstrated that the solar system as a whole is chaotic on a timescale of about four million years , confirming results from Jacques Laskar . This work was responsible for shattering the long-held view of the clockwork motion of the planets . More recently , Wisdom 's work has shed light on the complex evolution of the Moon and the tidal heating and dynamics of Enceladus . In addition , Wisdom is credited with developing numerous analytical and numerical techniques that are fundamental to modern celestial mechanics , most notably the symplectic map for the n-body problem ( developed together with Matthew J. Holman ) , which now forms the core of nearly every solar system dynamics integration scheme in use today . Jack Wisdom is co-author of Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics ."
