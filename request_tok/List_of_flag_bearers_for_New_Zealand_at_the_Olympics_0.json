  "/wiki/Sailing": "Sailing employs the wind - acting on sails , wingsails or kites - to propel a craft on the surface of the water ( sailing ship , sailboat , windsurfer , or kitesurfer ) , on ice ( iceboat ) or on land ( land yacht ) over a chosen course , which is often part of a larger plan of navigation . A course defined with respect to the true wind direction is called a point of sail . Conventional sailing craft can not derive power from sails on a point of sail that is too close into the wind . On a given point of sail , the sailor adjusts the alignment of each sail with respect to the apparent wind direction ( as perceived on the craft ) to mobilize the power of the wind . The forces transmitted via the sails are resisted by forces from the hull , keel , and rudder of a sailing craft , by forces from skate runners of an iceboat , or by forces from wheels of a land sailing craft to allow steering the course . In the 21st century , most sailing represents a form of recreation or sport . Recreational sailing or yachting can be divided into racing and cruising . Cruising can include extended offshore and ocean-crossing trips , coastal sailing within sight of land , and daysailing . Until the mid of the 19th century , sailing ships were the primary means for marine commerce , this period is known as Age of Sail .",

  "/wiki/Rowing_(sport)": "Rowing , sometimes referred to as crew in the United States , is a sport whose origins reach back to Ancient Egyptian times . It involves propelling a boat ( racing shell ) on water using oars . By pushing against the water with an oar , a force is generated to move the boat . The sport can be either recreational for enjoyment or fitness , or competitive , when athletes race against each other in boats . There are a number of different boat classes in which athletes compete , ranging from an individual shell ( called a single scull ) to an eight-person shell with a coxswain ( called a coxed eight ) . Modern rowing as a competitive sport can be traced to the early 17th century when races ( regattas ) were held between professional watermen on the River Thames in London , United Kingdom . Often prizes were offered by the London Guilds and Livery Companies . Amateur competition began towards the end of the 18th century with the arrival of boat clubs at the British public schools of Eton College , Shrewsbury School , Durham School , and Westminster School . Similarly , clubs were formed at the University of Oxford , with a race held between Brasenose College and Jesus College in 1815 . At the University of Cambridge the first recorded races were in 1827 . Public rowing clubs were beginning at the same time ; in England Leander Club was founded in 1818 , in Germany Der Hamburger und Germania Ruder Club was founded in 1836 and in the United States Narragansett Boat Club was founded in 1838 and Detroit Boat Club was founded in 1839 .

  "/wiki/Curling": "Curling is a sport in which players slide stones on a sheet of ice toward a target area which is segmented into four concentric circles . It is related to bowls , boules and shuffleboard . Two teams , each with four players , take turns sliding heavy , polished granite stones , also called rocks , across the ice curling sheet toward the house , a circular target marked on the ice . Each team has eight stones , with each player throwing two . The purpose is to accumulate the highest score for a game ; points are scored for the stones resting closest to the centre of the house at the conclusion of each end , which is completed when both teams have thrown all of their stones . A game usually consists of eight or ten ends . The player can induce a curved path , described as curl , by causing the stone to slowly turn as it slides . The path of the rock may be further influenced by two sweepers with brooms or brushes , who accompany it as it slides down the sheet and sweep the ice in front of the stone . Sweeping a rock decreases the friction , which makes the stone travel a straighter path ( with less curl ) and a longer distance . A great deal of strategy and teamwork go into choosing the ideal path and placement of a stone for each situation , and the skills of the curlers determine the degree to which the stone will achieve the desired result . This gives curling its nickname of chess on ice .",

The first bobsleds were built in St. Moritz , Switzerland , in the late 19th century by wealthy tourists from Victorian Britain who were staying at the Palace Hotel owned by Caspar Badrutt . The early sleds were adapted from boys ' delivery sleds and toboggans . These eventually evolved into bobsleighs , luges and skeletons . Initially the tourists would race their hand-built contraptions down the narrow streets of St. Moritz , however , as collisions increased growing opposition from St Moritz residents led to bobsledding being eventually banned from public highways . In the winter of 1884 , Badrutt had a purpose-built run constructed near the hamlet of Cresta . The Cresta Run remains the oldest in the world and is the home of the St. Moritz Tobogganing Club . It has hosted two Olympic Winter Games and is still in use . Modern Bobsleigh teams compete to complete a downhill route in the fastest times .

  "/wiki/Modern_pentathlon": "The modern pentathlon is an Olympic sport that comprises five different events ; fencing ( one-touch \u00e9p\u00e9e ) , freestyle swimming ( 200 m ) , equestrian show jumping ( 15 jumps ) , and a final combined event of pistol shooting and cross country running ( 3200 m ) . This last event is now referred to as the laser-run , since it alternates four legs of laser pistol shooting followed by an 800 m run ( for 3200 m in total ) . The event is inspired by the traditional pentathlon held during the ancient Olympics ; as the original events were patterned on the skills needed by an ideal Greek soldier of the era , the modern pentathlon is similarly patterned on events representing the skills needed by cavalry behind enemy lines . The sport has been a core sport of the Olympic Games since 1912 despite attempts to remove it . A world championships for modern pentathlon has been held annually since 1949 . Originally the competition took place over four or five days ; in 1996 a one-day format was adopted in an effort to be more audience-friendly . Modern pentathlon , despite its long Olympic history , has had to justify its inclusion in the modern Olympic Games several times . On February 11 , 2013 in Lausanne , the IOC confirmed modern pentathlon once again as one of the 25 core sports of the Olympic program through to 2020 . The governing body , Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne ( UIPM ) , administers the international sport in more than 90 countries ."
