Starting in the open-air black markets of bombed-out Hiroshima in 1946 , the film spans a period of more than ten years . The plot consists of a changing of the guard of new families and organizations with the same feuds and people , punctuated by the gritty violence .

  "/wiki/Tokusatsu": "Tokusatsu has origins in early Japanese theater , specifically in kabuki ( with its action- and fight-scenes ) and in bunraku , which utilized some of the earliest forms of special effects , specifically puppetry . Modern tokusatsu , however , did not begin to take shape until the early 1950s , [ citation needed ] with the conceptual and creative birth of Godzilla , one of the most famous monsters ( kaiju ) of all time . The special-effects artist Eiji Tsuburaya and the director Ishir\u014d Honda became the driving forces behind 1954 's Godzilla . Tsuburaya , inspired by the American film King Kong , formulated many of the techniques that would become staples of the genre , such as so-called suitmation - the use of a human actor in a costume to play a giant monster - combined with the use of miniatures and scaled-down city sets . Godzilla forever changed the landscape of Japanese science fiction , fantasy , and cinema by creating a uniquely Japanese vision in a genre typically dominated by American cinema . In 1954 , Godzilla kickstarted the kaiju genre in Japan called the Monster Boom , which remained extremely popular for several decades , with characters such as the aforementioned Godzilla , Gamera and King Ghidorah leading the market . However , in 1957 Shintoho produced the first film serial featuring the superhero character Super Giant , signaling a shift in popularity that favored masked heroes over giant monsters called the Henshin Boom started by Kamen Rider . Along with the anime Astro Boy , the Super Giant serials had a profound effect on the world of tokusatsu . The following year , Moonlight Mask premiered , the first of numerous televised superhero dramas that would make up one of the most popular tokusatsu subgenres . Created by K\u014dhan Kawauchi , he followed-up its success with the tokusatsu superhero shows Seven Color Mask ( 1959 ) and Messenger of Allah ( 1960 ) , both starring a young Sonny Chiba . These original productions preceded the first color-television tokusatsu series , Ambassador Magma and Ultraman , which heralded the Kyodai Hero genre , wherein a regular-sized protagonist grows to larger proportions to fight equally large monsters .
