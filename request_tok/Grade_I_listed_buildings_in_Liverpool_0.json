  "/wiki/Royal_Albert_Dock,_Liverpool": "The Royal Albert Dock is a complex of dock buildings and warehouses in Liverpool , England . Designed by Jesse Hartley and Philip Hardwick , it was opened in 1846 , and was the first structure in Britain to be built from cast iron , brick and stone , with no structural wood . As a result , it was the first non-combustible warehouse system in the world . It was known simply as the Albert Dock until 2018 , when it was granted a royal charter and had the honorific Royal added to its name . At the time of its construction the dock was considered to be revolutionary in its design because ships were loaded and unloaded directly from or to the warehouses . Two years after it opened it was modified to feature the world 's first hydraulic cranes . Due to its open yet secure design , the dock became a popular store for valuable cargoes such as brandy , cotton , tea , silk , tobacco , ivory and sugar . However , despite its advanced design , the rapid development of shipping technology meant that , within 50 years , larger and more open docks were required , although the Albert Dock remained a valuable store for cargo . During the Second World War , the dock was requisitioned by the Admiralty serving as a base for boats of the British Atlantic Fleet . The complex was damaged during air raids on Liverpool , notably during the May Blitz of 1941 . In the aftermath of the war , the financial problems of the owners and the general decline of docking in the city meant that the future of the Albert Dock was uncertain . Numerous plans were developed for the re-use of the buildings but none came to fruition and in 1972 the dock was finally closed .",
  "/wiki/Tuscan_order": "The Tuscan order ( Latin Ordo Tuscanicus or Ordo Tuscanus , with the meaning of Etruscan order ) is one of the two classical orders developed by the Romans , the other being the composite order . It is influenced by the Doric order , but with un-fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae . While relatively simple columns with round capitals had been part of the vernacular architecture of Italy and much of Europe since at least Etruscan architecture , the Romans did not consider this style to be a distinct architectural order ( for example , the Roman architect Vitruvius did not include it alongside his descriptions of the Greek Doric , Ionic , and Corinthian orders ) . Its classification as a separate formal order was made during the Italian Renaissance . Sebastiano Serlio described five orders including a Tuscan order , the solidest and least ornate , in his fourth book of Regole generali di architettura sopra le cinque maniere de gli edifici ( 1537 ) . Though Fra Giocondo had attempted a first illustration of a Tuscan capital in his printed edition of Vitruvius ( 1511 ) , he showed the capital with an egg and dart enrichment that belonged to the Ionic . The most rustic Tuscan order of Serlio was later carefully delineated by Andrea Palladio . In its simplicity , the Tuscan order is seen as similar to the Doric order , and yet in its overall proportions , intercolumniation and simpler entablature , it follows the ratios of the Ionic . This strong order was considered most appropriate in military architecture and in docks and warehouses when they were dignified by architectural treatment . Serlio found it suitable to fortified places , such as city gates , fortresses , castles , treasuries , or where artillery and ammunition are kept , prisons , seaports and other similar structures used in war .",
  "/wiki/Portico": "A portico is a porch leading to the entrance of a building , or extended as a colonnade , with a roof structure over a walkway , supported by columns or enclosed by walls . This idea was widely used in ancient Greece and has influenced many cultures , including most Western cultures . Some noteworthy examples of porticos are the East Portico of the United States Capitol , the portico adorning the Pantheon in Rome and the portico of University College London . Porticos are sometimes topped with pediments . Palladio was a pioneer of using temple-fronts for secular buildings . In the UK , the temple-front applied to The Vyne , Hampshire , was the first portico applied to an English country house . A pronaos ( UK : /pro\u028a\u02c8ne\u026a.\u0252s/ or US : /pro\u028a\u02c8ne\u026a.\u0259s/ ) is the inner area of the portico of a Greek or Roman temple , situated between the portico 's colonnade or walls and the entrance to the cella , or shrine . Roman temples commonly had an open pronaos , usually with only columns and no walls , and the pronaos could be as long as the cella . The word pronaos is Greek for before a temple . In Latin , a pronaos is also referred to as an anticum or prodomus .",
  "/wiki/Pediment": "A pediment is an architectural element found particularly in Classical , Neoclassical and Baroque architecture , and its derivatives , consisting of a gable , usually of a triangular shape , placed above the horizontal structure of the lintel , or entablature , if supported by columns . The tympanum , the triangular area within the pediment , is often decorated with relief sculpture . A pediment is sometimes the top element of a portico . For symmetric designs , it provides a centre point and often used to add grandness to entrances .",
  "/wiki/Architrave": "In classical architecture , an architrave ( /\u02c8\u0251\u02d0rk\u026atre\u026av/ ; from Italian : architrave chief beam , also called an epistyle ; from Greek \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd epistylon door frame ) is the lintel or beam that rests on the capitals of columns . The term can also apply to all sides , including the vertical members , of a frame with mouldings around a door or window . The word architrave is also used to refer more generally to a style of mouldings ( or other elements ) framing the top of a door , window or other rectangular opening , where the horizontal head casing extends across the tops of the vertical side casings where the elements join ( forming a butt joint , as opposed to a miter joint ) .",
  "/wiki/Bay_(architecture)": "In architecture , a bay is the space between architectural elements , or a recess or compartment . The term bay comes from Old French baee , meaning an opening or hole .",
  "/wiki/Iron": "Iron ( /\u02c8a\u026a\u0259rn/ ) is a chemical element with symbol Fe ( from Latin : ferrum ) and atomic number 26 . It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table . It is by mass the most common element on Earth , forming much of Earth 's outer and inner core . It is the fourth most common element in the Earth 's crust . In its metallic state , iron is rare in the Earth 's crust , limited to deposition by meteorites . Iron ores , by contrast , are among the most abundant in the Earth 's crust , although extracting usable metal from them requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1,500 \u00b0C ( 2,730 \u00b0F ) or higher , about 500 \u00b0C ( 900 \u00b0F ) higher than what is enough to smelt copper . Humans started to master that process in Eurasia only about 2000 BCE [ not verified in body ] , and the use of iron tools and weapons began to displace copper alloys , in some regions , only around 1200 BCE . That event is considered the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age . In the modern world , iron alloys , such as steel , inox , cast iron and special steels are by far the most common industrial metals , because of their high mechanical properties and low cost . Pristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are mirror-like silvery-gray . However , iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to give brown to black hydrated iron oxides , commonly known as rust . Unlike the oxides of some other metals , that form passivating layers , rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off , exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion .",
  "/wiki/Doric_order": "The Doric order was one of the three orders of ancient Greek and later Roman architecture ; the other two canonical orders were the Ionic and the Corinthian . The Doric is most easily recognized by the simple circular capitals at the top of columns . Originating in the western Dorian region of Greece , it is the earliest and in its essence the simplest of the orders , though still with complex details in the entablature above . The Greek Doric column was fluted or smooth-surfaced , and had no base , dropping straight into the stylobate or platform on which the temple or other building stood . The capital was a simple circular form , with some mouldings , under a square cushion that is very wide in early versions , but later more restrained . Above a plain architrave , the complexity comes in the frieze , where the two features originally unique to the Doric , the triglyph and guttae , are skeuomorphic memories of the beams and retaining pegs of the wooden constructions that preceded stone Doric temples . In stone they are purely ornamental . The relatively uncommon Roman and Renaissance Doric retained these , and often introduced thin layers of moulding or further ornament , as well as often using plain columns . More often they used versions of the Tuscan order , elaborated for nationalistic reasons by Italian Renaissance writers , which is in effect a simplified Doric , with un-fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae . The Doric order was much used in Greek Revival architecture from the 18th century onwards ; often earlier Greek versions were used , with wider columns and no bases to them . Since at least Vitruvius , it has been customary for writers to associate the Doric with masculine virtues ( the Ionic representing the feminine ) . It is also normally the cheapest of the orders to use .",

  "/wiki/Bank_of_England_Building,_Liverpool": "The Bank of England Building is a Grade I listed building located in Liverpool , England . It was designed by Charles Robert Cockerell and built in a Neoclassical style between 1845 and 1848 . The building was constructed as one of three branch banks for the Bank of England in the mid-19th century . The building combines several neoclassical architectural styles , notably Greek , Roman and Renaissance . The most evident of these is Greek , with four Doric style columns 'tying ' the ground and first floors together . The building itself is raised up from ground level , sitting atop a rough granite plinth . Despite only being three bays wide and seven bays deep , the building 's design was seen to give it an overwhelmingly massive and powerful appearance . The building is regarded as one of Cockerell 's most impressive and was described by Nikolaus Pevsner as a masterpiece of Victorian architecture .",
  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",
  "/wiki/Entablature": "An entablature ( /\u025bn\u02c8t\u00e6bl\u0259t\u0283\u0259r/ ; nativization of Italian intavolatura , from in in and tavola table ) is the superstructure of moldings and bands which lies horizontally above columns , resting on their capitals . Entablatures are major elements of classical architecture , and are commonly divided into the architrave ( the supporting member immediately above ; equivalent to the lintel in post and lintel construction ) , the frieze ( an unmolded strip that may or may not be ornamented ) , and the cornice ( the projecting member below the pediment ) . The Greek and Roman temples are believed to be based on wooden structures , the design transition from wooden to stone structures being called petrification .",
  "/wiki/Colonnade": "In classical architecture , a colonnade is a long sequence of columns joined by their entablature , often free-standing , or part of a building . Paired or multiple pairs of columns are normally employed in a colonnade which can be straight or curved . The space enclosed may be covered or open . In St. Peter 's Square in Rome , Bernini 's great colonnade encloses a vast open elliptical space . When in front of a building , screening the door ( Latin porta ) , it is called a portico , when enclosing an open court , a peristyle . A portico may be more than one rank of columns deep , as at the Pantheon in Rome or the stoae of Ancient Greece . When the intercolumniation is alternately wide and narrow , a colonnade may be termed araeosystyle ( Gr . \u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 , widely spaced , and \u03c3\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 , with columns set close together ) , as in the case of the western porch of St Paul 's Cathedral and the east front of the Louvre .",
  "/wiki/Cornice": "In architecture , a cornice ( from the Italian cornice meaning ledge ) is generally any horizontal decorative molding that crowns a building or furniture element - the cornice over a door or window , for instance , or the cornice around the top edge of a pedestal or along the top of an interior wall . A simple cornice may be formed just with a crown . A projecting cornice on a building has the function of throwing rainwater free of the building 's walls . In residential building practice , this function is handled by projecting gable ends , roof eaves , and gutters . However , house eaves may also be called cornices if they are finished with decorative molding . In this sense , while most cornices are also eaves ( in that they overhang the sides of the building ) , not all eaves are usually considered cornices - eaves are primarily functional and not necessarily decorative , and a cornice has a decorative aspect to it . The projecting cornice of a building may appear to be heavy and hence in danger of falling , particularly on commercial buildings , but often it may be very light , made of pressed metal .",

The numerous depictions of cherubim assign to them many different roles , such as protecting the entrance of the Garden of Eden . In Jewish angelic hierarchy , cherubim have the ninth ( second-lowest ) rank in Maimonides ' Mishneh Torah ( 12th century ) , and the third rank in Kabbalistic works such as Berit Menuchah ( 14th century ) . De Coelesti Hierarchia places them in the highest rank alongside Seraphim and Thrones . In the Book of Ezekiel and ( at least some ) Christian icons , the cherub is depicted as having two pairs of wings , and four faces : that of a lion ( representative of all wild animals ) , an ox ( domestic animals ) , a human ( humanity ) , and an eagle ( birds ) . Their legs were straight , the soles of their feet like the hooves of a bull , gleaming like polished brass . Later tradition ascribes to them a variety of physical appearances . Some early midrashic literature conceives of them as non-corporeal . In Western Christian tradition , cherubim have become associated with the putto ( derived from classical Cupid/Eros ) , resulting in depictions of cherubim as small , plump , winged boys . In Islam , the cherubim are the angels closest to God . Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall noted R\u016b\u1e25 as one of the most noble among the cherubim .",
  "/wiki/Keystone_(architecture)": "A keystone ( also known as capstone ) is the wedge-shaped stone at the apex of a masonry arch or typically round-shaped one at the apex of a vault . In both cases it is the final piece placed during construction and locks all the stones into position , allowing the arch or vault to bear weight . In arches and vaults ( such as quasi-domes ) keystones are often enlarged beyond the structural requirements and decorated . A variant in domes and crowning vaults is a lantern . Keystones , as a hallmark of strength or good architecture , or their suggested form are sometimes placed in the centre of the flat top of doors , recesses and windows for decorative effect , so as to form an upward projection of a lintel . Although a masonry arch or vault can not be self-supporting until the keystone is placed , the keystone experiences the least stress of any of the voussoirs , due to its position at the apex . Old keystones can decay due to vibration , a condition known as bald arch . In a rib-vaulted ceiling , keystones commonly mark the intersections of any two or more arched ribs . For aesthetics , keystones are often larger than ribs in vaults and many of the voussoirs ( arch stones ) in arches , or embellished with a boss . Mannerist architects of the 16th century often designed arches with enlarged and slightly dropped keystones , as in the church house entrance portal at Colditz Castle ( see image ) . Numerous examples are found in the work of Sebastiano Serlio , a 16th-century Italian Mannerist architect .",
  "/wiki/Ionic_order": "The Ionic order forms one of the three classical orders of classical architecture , the other two canonic orders being the Doric and the Corinthian . There are two lesser orders : the Tuscan ( a plainer Doric ) , and the rich variant of Corinthian called the composite order , both added by 16th-century Italian architectural writers , based on Roman practice . Of the three canonic orders , the Ionic order has the narrowest columns . The Ionic capital is characterized by the use of volutes . The Ionic columns normally stand on a base which separates the shaft of the column from the stylobate or platform ; the cap is usually enriched with egg-and-dart . Since Vitruvius , a female character has been ascribed to the Ionic ( in contrast to the masculine Doric ) .",
  "/wiki/Aedicule": "In ancient Roman religion , an aedicula ( plural aediculae ) is a small shrine . The word aedicula is the diminutive of the Latin aedes , a temple building , and can translate into English as aedicule or edicule . Many aediculae were household shrines that held small altars or statues of the Lares and Penates . The Lares were Roman deities protecting the house and the family household gods . The Penates were originally patron gods ( really genii ) of the storeroom , later becoming household gods guarding the entire house . Other aediculae were small shrines within larger temples , usually set on a base , surmounted by a pediment and surrounded by columns . In Roman architecture the aedicula has this representative function in the society . They are installed in public buildings like the Triumphal arch , City gate , or Thermes . The Celsus Library in Ephesus ( 2. c. AD ) is a good example . From the 4th century Christianization of the Roman Empire onwards such shrines , or the framework enclosing them , are often called by the Biblical term tabernacle , which becomes extended to any elaborated framework for a niche , window or picture .",
  "/wiki/Wrought_iron": "Wrought iron is an iron alloy with a very low carbon ( less than 0.08% ) content in contrast to cast iron ( 2.1% to 4% ) . It is a semi-fused mass of iron with fibrous slag inclusions ( up to 2% by weight ) , which gives it a grain resembling wood that is visible when it is etched or bent to the point of failure . Wrought iron is tough , malleable , ductile , corrosion-resistant and easily welded . Before the development of effective methods of steelmaking and the availability of large quantities of steel , wrought iron was the most common form of malleable iron . It was given the name wrought because it was hammered , rolled or otherwise worked while hot enough to expel molten slag . [ note 1 ] The modern functional equivalent of wrought iron is mild steel , also called low-carbon steel . Neither wrought iron nor mild steel contain enough carbon to be hardenable by heating and quenching . :145 Wrought iron is highly refined , with a small amount of slag forged out into fibres . It consists of around 99.4% iron by mass . The presence of slag is beneficial for blacksmithing operations , and gives the material its unique fibrous structure . The silicate filaments of the slag also protect the iron from corrosion and diminish the effect of fatigue caused by shock and vibration . Historically , a modest amount of wrought iron was refined into steel , which was used mainly to produce swords , cutlery , chisels , axes and other edged tools as well as springs and files .",
  "/wiki/Rustication_(architecture)": "In classical architecture rustication is a range of masonry techniques giving visible surfaces a finish that contrasts in texture with the smoothly finished , squared-block masonry surfaces called ashlar . The visible face of each individual block is cut back around the edges to make its size and placing very clear . In addition the central part of the face of each block may be given a deliberately rough or patterned surface . Rusticated masonry is usually dressed , or squared off neatly , on all sides of the stones except the face that will be visible when the stone is put in place . This is given wide joints that emphasize the edges of each block , by angling the edges ( channel-jointed ) , or dropping them back a little . The main part of the exposed face may be worked flat and smooth or left with , or worked , to give a more or less rough or patterned surface . Rustication is often used to give visual weight to the ground floor in contrast to smooth ashlar above . Though intended to convey a rustic simplicity , the finish is highly artificial , and the faces of the stones often carefully worked to achieve an appearance of a coarse finish . Rustication was used in ancient times , but became especially popular in the revived classical styles of Italian Renaissance architecture and that of subsequent periods , above all in the lower floors of secular buildings . It remains in use in some modern architecture . Similar finishes are very common in medieval architecture , especially in castles , walls and similar buildings , but here it merely arises from an unwillingness to spend the extra money required for ashlar masonry in a particular building , and lacks the deliberate emphasis on the joints between blocks . Though it often achieves a decorative effect , this is something of a by-product , and the exploitation for architectural effect within a single building of contrasts between rusticated and ashlar surfaces is rarely seen .",

The Archbishop of Canterbury is the most senior cleric , although the monarch is the supreme governor . The Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion . It traces its history to the Christian church recorded as existing in the Roman province of Britain by the third century , and to the 6th-century Gregorian mission to Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury . The English church renounced papal authority when Henry VIII failed to secure an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon in 1534 . The English Reformation accelerated under Edward VI 's regents , before a brief restoration of papal authority under Queen Mary I and King Philip . The Act of Supremacy 1558 renewed the breach , and the Elizabethan Settlement charted a course enabling the English church to describe itself as both catholic and reformed :",
  "/wiki/Parish_church": "A parish church ( or parochial church ) in Christianity is the church which acts as the religious centre of a parish . In many parts of the world , especially in rural areas , the parish church may play a significant role in community activities , often allowing its premises to be used for non-religious community events . The church building reflects this status , and there is considerable variety in the size and style of parish churches .

  "/wiki/Vestry": "A vestry was a committee for the local secular and ecclesiastical government for a parish in England and Wales , which originally met in the vestry or sacristy of the parish church , and consequently became known colloquially as the vestry . For many centuries the vestries were the sole de facto local government and presided over local , communal fundraising and expenditure until the mid or late 19th century with local Established Church chairmanship . More punitive matters tended to be dealt with by the manorial court and hundred court during the epoch of the vestries . Their initial power derived from custom and was very occasionally ratified by the common law or asserted in statute such as the Elizabethan Poor Law . At the high point of their powers before removal of Poor Law responsibilities in 1834 , the vestries spent not far short of one-fifth of the budget of the British government which derived much of its income from global trade and imperialism . Secular and ecclesiastical aspects of the vestries were separated , for all areas where they had not earlier been , under a reforming statute of 1894 . Their secular duties have been performed in England since then by parish councils or more superior councils , leaving their ecclesiastical duties to the Church of England where they have been performed by parochial church councils ( PCCs ) since 1921 . Realised secularisation of local government was opposed by administrations of the Tory Party preceding the Third Salisbury ministry , the British government led by Lord Salisbury from 1895 to 1900 and several earlier influential High Whigs . A public right in the PCC ( church ) meeting remains in that all Members of an overlapping civil parish can speak at their annual meetings ( which may appoint churchwardens for instance ) . A right to tax by a PCC for church chancel repairs remains as to liable ( apportioned ) local residents and businesses across an apportioned area of many church parishes , in the form of chancel repair liability however in some tithes were replaced by no further such taxation .",
  "/wiki/Organ_(music)": "In music , the organ is a keyboard instrument of one or more pipe divisions or other means for producing tones , each played with its own keyboard , played with the hands on a keyboard . The organ is a relatively old musical instrument , dating from the time of Ctesibius of Alexandria ( 285-222 BC ) , who invented the water organ . It was played throughout the Ancient Greek and Ancient Roman world , particularly during races and games . During the early medieval period it spread from the Byzantine Empire , where it continued to be used in secular ( non-religious ) and imperial court music , to Western Europe , where it gradually assumed a prominent place in the liturgy of the Catholic Church . Subsequently it re-emerged as a secular and recital instrument in the Classical music tradition .",
  "/wiki/Stained_glass_window": "The term stained glass can refer to coloured glass as a material or to works created from it . Throughout its thousand-year history , the term has been applied almost exclusively to the windows of churches and other significant religious buildings . Although traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows , the creations of modern stained glass artists also include three-dimensional structures and sculpture . Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term stained glass to include domestic lead light and objects d'art created from foil glasswork exemplified in the famous lamps of Louis Comfort Tiffany . As a material stained glass is glass that has been coloured by adding metallic salts during its manufacture . The coloured glass is crafted into stained glass windows in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures , held together ( traditionally ) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame . Painted details and yellow stain are often used to enhance the design . The term stained glass is also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln . Stained glass , as an art and a craft , requires the artistic skill to conceive an appropriate and workable design , and the engineering skills to assemble the piece . A window must fit snugly into the space for which it is made , must resist wind and rain , and also , especially in the larger windows , must support its own weight . Many large windows have withstood the test of time and remained substantially intact since the Late Middle Ages . In Western Europe they constitute the major form of pictorial art to have survived .",

Burne-Jones was involved in the rejuvenation of the tradition of stained glass art in Britain ; his works include windows in St. Philip 's Cathedral , Birmingham , St Martin in the Bull Ring , Birmingham , Holy Trinity Church , Sloane Square , Chelsea , St Peter and St Paul parish church in Cromer , St Martin 's Church in Brampton , Cumbria ( the church designed by Philip Webb ) , St Michael 's Church , Brighton , Trinity Church in Frome , All Saints , Jesus Lane , Cambridge , St Edmund Hall and Christ Church , two colleges of the University of Oxford . His stained glass works also feature in St. Anne 's Church , Brown Edge , Staffordshire Moorlands and St. Edward the Confessor church at Cheddleton Staffordshire . Burne-Jones 's early paintings show the inspiration of Dante Gabriel Rossetti , but by the 1860s Burne-Jones was discovering his own artistic voice . In 1877 , he was persuaded to show eight oil paintings at the Grosvenor Gallery ( a new rival to the Royal Academy ) . These included The Beguiling of Merlin . The timing was right and he was taken up as a herald and star of the new Aesthetic Movement . Burne-Jones worked in crafts ; including designing ceramic tiles , jewellery , tapestries and mosaics .",
  "/wiki/Tracery": "In architecture , tracery is the stonework elements that support the glass in a Gothic window . The term probably derives from the 'tracing floors ' on which the complex patterns of late Gothic windows were laid out . There are two main types , plate tracery and the later bar tracery . The evolving style from Romanesque to Gothic architecture and changing features , like the thinning of lateral walls and enlarging of windows lead to the innovation of tracery . The earliest form of tracery , called plate tracery , began as openings that were pierced from a stone slab . Bar tracery was then implemented , having derived from the plate tracery . However instead of a slab , the windows were defined by molded stone mullions which were lighter and allowed for more openings and intricate designs . Other notable styles of tracery to follow include geometrical tracery and curvilinear ( flowing ) tracery .",
  "/wiki/Clerestory": "In architecture , a clerestory ( /\u02c8kl\u026a\u0259rst\u0254\u02d0ri/ KLEER-stor-ee ; lit . clear storey , also clearstory , clearstorey , or overstorey ) is a high section of wall that contains windows above eye level . The purpose is to admit light , fresh air , or both . Historically , clerestory denoted an upper level of a Roman basilica or of the nave of a Romanesque or Gothic church , the walls of which rise above the rooflines of the lower aisles and are pierced with windows . Similar structures have been used in transportation vehicles to provide additional lighting , ventilation , or headroom .",
  "/wiki/Buttresses": "A buttress is an architectural structure built against or projecting from a wall which serves to support or reinforce the wall . Buttresses are fairly common on more ancient buildings , as a means of providing support to act against the lateral ( sideways ) forces arising out of the roof structures that lack adequate bracing . The term counterfort can be synonymous with buttress , and is often used when referring to dams , retaining walls and other structures holding back earth . Early examples of buttresses are found on the Eanna Temple ( ancient Uruk ) , dating to as early as the 4th millennium BCE . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/Parapet": "A parapet is a barrier which is an extension of the wall at the edge of a roof , terrace , balcony , walkway or other structure . The word comes ultimately from the Italian parapetto ( parare to cover/defend and petto breast ) . The German equivalent Br\u00fcstung has the same meaning . Where extending above a roof , a parapet may simply be the portion of an exterior wall that continues above the edge line of the roof surface , or may be a continuation of a vertical feature beneath the roof such as a fire wall or party wall . Parapets were originally used to defend buildings from military attack , but today they are primarily used as guard rails and to prevent the spread of fires . In the Bible the Hebrews are obligated to build a parapet on the roof of their houses to prevent people falling .",

  "/wiki/Chancel": "In church architecture , the chancel is the space around the altar , including the choir and the sanctuary ( sometimes called the presbytery ) , at the liturgical east end of a traditional Christian church building . It may terminate in an apse . It is generally the area used by the clergy and choir during worship , while the congregation is in the nave . Direct access may be provided by a priest 's door , usually on the south side of the church . This is one definition , sometimes called the strict one ; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels , these are also often counted as part of the chancel , especially when discussing architecture . In smaller churches , where the altar is backed by the outside east wall and there is no distinct choir , the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area . In churches with a retroquire area behind the altar , this may only be included in the broader definition of chancel . In a cathedral or other large church , there may be a distinct choir area at the start of the chancel ( looking from the nave ) , before reaching the sanctuary , and an ambulatory may run beside and behind it . All these may be included in the chancel , at least in architectural terms ( see above ) . In many churches , the altar has now been moved to the front of the chancel , in what was built as the choir area , or to the centre of the transept , somewhat confusing the distinction between chancel , choir and sanctuary . In churches with less traditional plans , the term may not be useful in either architectural or ecclesiastical terms . The chancel may be a step or two higher than the level of the nave , and the sanctuary is often raised still further .",
  "/wiki/Gargoyles": "In architecture , a gargoyle ( /\u02c8\u0261\u0251\u02d0r\u0261\u0254\u026al/ ) is a carved or formed grotesque:6-8 with a spout designed to convey water from a roof and away from the side of a building , thereby preventing rainwater from running down masonry walls and eroding the mortar between . Architects often used multiple gargoyles on a building to divide the flow of rainwater off the roof to minimize the potential damage from a rainstorm . A trough is cut in the back of the gargoyle and rainwater typically exits through the open mouth . Gargoyles are usually an elongated fantastical animal because the length of the gargoyle determines how far water is directed from the wall . When Gothic flying buttresses were used , aqueducts were sometimes cut into the buttress to divert water over the aisle walls .",
  "/wiki/Spire": "A spire is a tapering conical or pyramidal structure on the top of a building , often a skyscraper or a church tower , similar to a steep tented roof . Etymologically , the word is derived from the Old English word spir , meaning a sprout , shoot , or stalk of grass .",
  "/wiki/Nave": "The nave /ne\u026av/ is the central part of a church , stretching from the ( normally western ) main entrance or rear wall , to the transepts , or in a church without transepts , to the chancel . When a church contains side aisles , as in a basilica-type building , the strict definition of the term nave is restricted to the central aisle . In a broader , more colloquial sense , the nave includes all areas available for the lay worshippers , including the side-aisles and transepts . Either way , the nave is distinct from the area reserved for the choir and clergy .",
  "/wiki/Barrel_vault": "A barrel vault , also known as a tunnel vault or a wagon vault , is an architectural element formed by the extrusion of a single curve ( or pair of curves , in the case of a pointed barrel vault ) along a given distance . The curves are typically circular in shape , lending a semi-cylindrical appearance to the total design . The barrel vault is the simplest form of a vault : effectively a series of arches placed side by side ( i.e. , one after another ) . It is a form of barrel roof . As with all arch-based constructions , there is an outward thrust generated against the walls underneath a barrel vault . There are several mechanisms for absorbing this thrust . One is to make the walls exceedingly thick and strong - this is a primitive and sometimes unacceptable method . A more elegant method is to build two or more vaults parallel to each other ; the forces of their outward thrusts will thus negate each other . This method was most often used in construction of churches , where several vaulted naves ran parallel down the length of the building . However , the outer walls of the outermost vault would still have to be quite strong or reinforced by buttressing . The third and most elegant mechanism to resist the lateral thrust was to create an intersection of two barrel vaults at right angles , thus forming a groin vault . Barrel vaults are known from Ancient Egypt , and were used extensively in Roman architecture .",
  "/wiki/Chapel": "A chapel is a Christian place of prayer and worship that is usually relatively small , and is distinguished from a church . The term has several senses . Firstly , smaller spaces inside a church that have their own altar are often called chapels ; the Lady chapel is a common type of these . Secondly , a chapel is a place of worship , sometimes non-denominational , that is part of a building or complex with some other main purpose , such as a school , college , hospital , palace or large aristocratic house , castle , barracks , prison , funeral home , cemetery , airport , or a military or commercial ship . Thirdly , chapels are small places of worship , built as satellite sites by a church or monastery , for example in remote areas ; these are often called a chapel of ease . A feature of all these types is that often no clergy were permanently resident or specifically attached to the chapel . Finally , for historical reasons , chapel is also often the term used for independent or nonconformist places of worship in Great Britain - outside the established church , even where in practice they operate as a parish church . The earliest Christian places of worship are now often referred to as chapels , as they were not dedicated buildings but rather a dedicated chamber within a building . Most larger churches had one or more secondary altars which , if they occupied a distinct space , would often be called a chapel . In Russian Orthodox tradition , the chapels were built underneath city gates , where most people could visit them . The most famous example is the Iberian Chapel . Although chapels frequently refer to Christian places of worship , they are also commonly found in Jewish synagogues and do not necessarily denote a specific denomination .",

  "/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_England": "The Royal Arms of England are the arms first adopted in a fixed form at the start of the age of heraldry ( circa 1200 ) as personal arms by the Plantagenet kings who ruled England from 1154 . In the popular mind they have come to symbolise the nation of England , although according to heraldic usage nations do not bear arms , only persons and corporations do . The blazon of the Arms of Plantagenet is : Gules , three lions passant guardant in pale or armed and langued azure , signifying three identical gold lions ( also known as leopards ) with blue tongues and claws , walking past but facing the observer , arranged in a column on a red background . Although the tincture azure of tongue and claws is not cited in many blazons , they are historically a distinguishing feature of the Arms of England . This coat , designed in the High Middle Ages , has been variously combined with those of the Kings of France , Scotland , a symbol of Ireland , the House of Nassau and the Kingdom of Hanover , according to dynastic and other political changes occurring in England , but has not altered since it took a fixed form in the reign of Richard I ( 1189-1199 ) , the second Plantagenet king . Although in England the official blazon refers to lions , French heralds historically used the term leopard to represent the lion passant guardant , and hence the arms of England , no doubt , are more correctly blazoned , leopards . Without doubt the same animal was intended , but different names were given according to the position ; in later times the name lion was given to both . Royal emblems depicting lions were first used by Danish Vikings , Saxons ( Lions were adopted in Germanic tradition around the 5th century , they were re-interpreted in a Christian context in the western kingdoms of Gaul and Northern Italy in the 6th and 7th centuries ) and Normans . Later , with Plantagenets a formal and consistent English heraldry system emerged at the end of the 12th century . The earliest surviving representation of an escutcheon , or shield , displaying three lions is that on the Great Seal of King Richard I ( 1189-1199 ) , which initially displayed one or two lions rampant , but in 1198 was permanently altered to depict three lions passant , perhaps representing Richard I 's principal three positions as King of the English , Duke of the Normans , and Duke of the Aquitanians . In 1340 , Edward III laid claim to the throne of France , and thus adopted the Royal arms of France which he quartered with his paternal arms , the Royal Arms of England . He placed the French arms in the 1st and 4th quarters .",

Cragg was an enthusiast in the use of prefabricated ironwork in the structure of buildings , and in the early 19th century became interested in building churches . He had been discussing building a church in Toxteth Park , Liverpool , and in 1809 plans had been drawn up for this by J. M. Gandy . This church was never built , but in 1812 Cragg met Thomas Rickman , and together they designed the three churches in Liverpool incorporating Cragg 's cast iron elements . The first of these was St George 's Church , Everton ( 1813-14 ) . The exterior of this church is largely in stone , but the framework of its interior , including the galleries , and the window tracery are in cast iron .

  "/wiki/Ashlar": "Ashlar ( /\u02c8\u00e6\u0283l\u0259r/ ) is finely dressed ( cut , worked ) stone , either an individual stone that was worked until squared or the structure built from it . Ashlar is the finest stone masonry unit , generally rectangular cuboid , mentioned by Vitruvius as opus isodomum , or less frequently trapezoidal . Precisely cut on all faces adjacent to those of other stones , ashlar is capable of very thin joints between blocks , and the visible face of the stone may be quarry-faced or feature a variety of treatments : tooled , smoothly polished or rendered with another material for decorative effect . One such decorative treatment consists of small grooves achieved by the application of a metal comb . Generally used only on softer stone ashlar , this decoration is known as mason 's drag . Ashlar is in contrast to rubble masonry , which employs irregularly shaped stones , sometimes minimally worked or selected for similar size , or both . Ashlar is related but distinct from other stone masonry that is finely dressed but not quadrilateral , such as curvilinear and polygonal masonry . Ashlar may be coursed , which involves lengthy horizontals layers of stone blocks laid in parallel , and therefore with continuous horizontal joints . Ashlar may also be random , which involves stone blocks laid with deliberately discontinuous courses and therefore discontinuous joints both vertically and horizontally . In either case , it generally uses a joining material such as mortar to bind the blocks together , although dry ashlar construction , metal ties , and other methods of assembly have been used . The dry ashlar of Inca architecture in Cusco and Machu Picchu is particularly fine and famous .",
  "/wiki/English_Gothic_architecture": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls .",
  "/wiki/Arcade_(architecture)": "An arcade is a succession of contiguous arches , with each arch supported by a colonnade of columns or piers . Exterior arcades are designed to provide a sheltered walkway for pedestrians . The walkway may be lined with retail stores . An arcade may feature arches on both sides of the walkway . Alternatively , a blind arcade superimposes arcading against a solid wall . Blind arcades are a feature of Romanesque architecture that influenced Gothic architecture . In the Gothic architectural tradition , the arcade can be located in the interior , in the lowest part of the wall of the nave , supporting the triforium and the clerestory in a cathedral , or on the exterior , in which they are usually part of the walkways that surround the courtyard and cloisters . Many medieval arcades housed shops or stalls , either in the arcaded space itself , or set into the main wall behind . From this , arcade has become a general word for a group of shops in a single building , regardless of the architectural form . The word arcade comes from French arcade from Proven\u00e7al arcada or Italian arcata , based on Latin arcus , bow ( see arc and arch ) .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

  "/wiki/Liverpool_Town_Hall": "Liverpool Town Hall stands in High Street at its junction with Dale Street , Castle Street , and Water Street in Liverpool , Merseyside , England . It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building , and described in the list as one of the finest surviving 18th-century town halls . The authors of the Buildings of England series refer to its magnificent scale , and consider it to be probably the grandest .suite of civic rooms in the country , and an outstanding and complete example of late Georgian decoration . It is not an administrative building but a civic suite , Lord Mayor 's parlour and Council chamber ; local government administration is centred at the nearby Municipal Buildings . The town hall was built between 1749 and 1754 to a design by John Wood the Elder replacing an earlier town hall nearby . An extension to the north designed by James Wyatt was added in 1785 . Following a fire in 1795 the hall was largely rebuilt and a dome designed by Wyatt was built . Minor alterations have subsequently been made . The streets surrounding its site have altered since its initiation , notably when viewed from Castle Street , the south-side , it appears as off-centre . This is because Water Street which ran to the junction with Dale Street , the west-east axis , was continuous and built up across the junction so that the town hall was not visible originally from that aspect . The structures were removed 150 years after this to expose the building from this position . The ground floor contains the city 's Council Chamber and a Hall of Remembrance for the Liverpool servicemen killed in the First World War .",
