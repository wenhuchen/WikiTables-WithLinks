  "/wiki/Antioch_College": "Antioch College is a private liberal arts college in Yellow Springs , Ohio . Founded in 1850 by the Christian Connection , the college began operating in 1852 as a non-sectarian institution ; politician and education reformer Horace Mann became its first president . It was the founding , constituent college of Antioch University System , which Antioch College remained a part of from 1978 until 2008 when it closed . Thereafter , a group of alumni formed a new Ohio corporation , Antioch College Continuation Corporation , and bought from the University both the physical campus and a license to use the name Antioch College . The college remained closed for three years before reopening in 2011 as an independent institution . Antioch is one of only a few liberal-arts institutions in the United States featuring a cooperative education work program mandatory for all students . Democracy and shared governance , especially as a means to activism and social justice , are at the heart of the college . Since 1921 Antioch 's educational approach has blended practical work experience with classroom learning , and participatory community governance . Students receive narrative evaluations and academic letter grades . Antioch College is a member of the Great Lakes Colleges Association , the Global Liberal Arts Alliance , and the Southwestern Ohio Council for Higher Education .

  "/wiki/Ballard_Road_Covered_Bridge": "The Ballard Road Covered Bridge is a historic wooden covered bridge in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Ohio . Built in the late nineteenth century and since bypassed , the bridge has been named a historic site . Following a design by H.E . Hebble , James E. Brown built the bridge across Caesar 's Creek in 1883 . He chose to name it for a nearby industrialist , Lyman Ballard , who had constructed a water-powered mill on the creek to grind grain approximately thirty years before . Brown chose a seven-panel Howe truss design for the bridge , which measures 80 feet ( 24 m ) in length . Built of wood with iron elements on abutments of limestone and covered with a metal roof , the single-span bridge is covered with vertical siding and retains the original square shape of its portals . Much of Greene County is underlain by high-quality limestone ( the McDonald Farm near Xenia supplied limestone for the Washington Monument ) and from this limestone the bridge 's abutments were taken ; it appears that the quarries for the abutments were located elsewhere in the surrounding New Jasper Township . Although the Ballard Road Bridge remains in its original rural setting , its surroundings are no longer as quiet as originally ; U.S. Route 35 has been constructed as a controlled-access highway immediately to the south , and Ballard Road now dead-ends at the bridge . By the 1970s , it was one of just eighteen Howe truss covered bridges remaining in Ohio , although thousands of bridges were built to this design in the 19th century throughout the United States . As such , it was deemed historically significant enough to qualify to be added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 . The Ballard Road Bridge is one of five covered bridges in Greene County , and the only one open to road traffic .",

  "/wiki/Bank_of_Xenia": "The Bank of Xenia is a historic former bank building in downtown Xenia , Ohio , United States . Built in 1835 , it was the location of Greene County 's first bank , which opened on June 1 of that year . For thirty years , the building was used as a bank , becoming the local branch of the State Bank of Ohio in 1846 and changing its name to First National Bank in 1863 . After First National moved to a newer building in 1865 , it was no longer used as a bank ; among its later owners was A.C. Messenger , a physician who used it as his home and office . In the 1880s , the bank was a party to a lawsuit known as Xenia Bank v. Stewart , which was decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1885 . Built in a heavily Greek Revival style of architecture , upon a stone foundation , the bank is a two-story structure constructed with a rectangular plan . Located along Detroit Street in downtown Xenia , its pilastered appearance is dominated by the entrance porch , which features two columns built in the Doric order . Above the columns is a small second-story balcony , which is protected by a wrought iron railing ; the frieze on the balcony 's side includes both metopes and triglyphs that alternate in a classical style .

  "/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland .",

  "/wiki/Dean_Family_Farm": "The Dean Family Farm , listed since 1975 as a historic site on the National Register of Historic Places , has its origins with the immigration of Daniel Dean , a native of Tobermore , County Londonderry , Ireland , to Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , in 1784 when he was aged 18 , according to Dean family histories . Daniel was a son of George Roger Dean , who fought in the Colonial line , and Mary Campbell who was reared with her sister by the Duke of Argyl at Inveraray Scotland , the clan Campbells ' ancestral home . [ citation needed ] The National Register and an Ohio Historic Inventory , dated 11 October 1974 , list the historic site at 199 N. Ballard Road , Xenia , as having five buildings dating from the 1820s on 157 acres ( 0.6 km2 ) along Caesar 's Creek in Greene County , Ohio . The National Register listing was expanded by a boundary increase adding 199 Ballard in 1994 , and renaming as the Dean Family Farm Historic District . Daniel Dean , born October 20 , 1766 in Ireland was a son of George Roger Dean , whom DAR archival records list as a Pennsylvania sergeant and militiaman in the 1770s , along with his elder brothers James and David Dean . A weaver by trade , Daniel Dean lived briefly in Pennsylvania , Maryland and Virginia before meeting and marrying Jannet Jenny Steele ( 1768-November 18 , 1841 ) , a Scots-Irish girl of Steele 's Tavern in Augusta County , Virginia . The couple relocated near Mount Sterling , Kentucky , where Dean built a mill , a house for the couple and another for his sister and mother , both named Mary , whom he brought from Ireland to Kentucky via Wilmington , North Carolina , in 1790 . Daniel and Jannet had the first of their 11 children while in Kentucky . But when Ohio became a free state in 1803 , Dean , an ardent abolitionist , scouted out the new lands north of the Ohio River with his brother-in-law , Henry Barnes , a skilled builder whose son later would become Greene County 's wartime sheriff and treasurer . Dean , shortly thereafter , bought 2,000 acres ( 8.1 km2 ) on Caesar 's Creek near the settlement of Xenia , but he spent several years litigating to perfect his title . Once his title was secure , Dean joined Barnes and their families in relocating via Fort Washington ( later Cincinnati ) to Greene County in September 1812 . They first dined using as a table a huge , flat rock - then began a lucrative business in which Dean harvested and milled timber for lumber used by Barnes to build homes in and near Xenia , Ohio .",

  "/wiki/Gilded_Age": "In United States history , the Gilded Age was an era that occurred during the late 19th century , from the 1870s to about 1900 . The Gilded Age was an era of rapid economic growth , especially in the Northern United States and the Western United States . As American wages grew much higher than those in Europe , especially for skilled workers , the period saw an influx of millions of European immigrants . The rapid expansion of industrialization led to a real wage growth of 60% , between 1860 and 1890 , and spread across the ever-increasing labor force . The average annual wage per industrial worker ( including men , women , and children ) rose from $ 380 in 1880 , to $ 564 in 1890 , a gain of 48% . Conversely , the Gilded Age was also an era of abject poverty and inequality , as millions of immigrants - many from impoverished regions - poured into the United States , and the high concentration of wealth became more visible and contentious . Railroads were the major growth industry , with the factory system , mining , and finance increasing in importance . Immigration from Europe , and the eastern states , led to the rapid growth of the West , based on farming , ranching , and mining . Labor unions became increasingly important in the rapidly growing industrial cities . Two major nationwide depressions - the Panic of 1873 and the Panic of 1893 - interrupted growth and caused social and political upheavals . The South , after the Civil War , remained economically devastated ; its economy became increasingly tied to commodities , cotton , and tobacco production , which suffered from low prices . With the end of the Reconstruction era in 1877 , African-American people in the South were stripped of political power and voting rights , and were left economically disadvantaged .",

  "/wiki/Wright_brothers": "The Wright brothers - Orville ( August 19 , 1871 - January 30 , 1948 ) and Wilbur ( April 16 , 1867 - May 30 , 1912 ) - were two American aviation pioneers generally credited with inventing , building , and flying the world 's first successful motor-operated airplane . They made the first controlled , sustained flight of a powered , heavier-than-air aircraft with the Wright Flyer on December 17 , 1903 , 4 mi ( 6 km ) south of Kitty Hawk , North Carolina . In 1904-05 , the brothers developed their flying machine to make longer-running and more aerodynamic flights with the Wright Flyer II , followed by the first truly practical fixed-wing aircraft , the Wright Flyer III . The Wright brothers were also the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed-wing powered flight possible . The brothers ' breakthrough was their creation of a three-axis control system , which enabled the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and to maintain its equilibrium . This method remains standard on fixed-wing aircraft of all kinds . From the beginning of their aeronautical work , the Wright brothers focused on developing a reliable method of pilot control as the key to solving the flying problem . This approach differed significantly from other experimenters of the time who put more emphasis on developing powerful engines . Using a small home-built wind tunnel , the Wrights also collected more accurate data than any before , enabling them to design more efficient wings and propellers . Their first U.S. patent did not claim invention of a flying machine , but a system of aerodynamic control that manipulated a flying machine 's surfaces . The brothers gained the mechanical skills essential to their success by working for years in their Dayton , Ohio-based shop with printing presses , bicycles , motors , and other machinery . Their work with bicycles , in particular , influenced their belief that an unstable vehicle such as a flying machine could be controlled and balanced with practice ."
