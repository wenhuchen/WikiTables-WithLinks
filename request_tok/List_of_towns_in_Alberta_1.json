  "/wiki/Unincorporated_area": "In law , an unincorporated area is a region of land that is not governed by a local municipal corporation ; similarly an unincorporated community is a settlement that is not governed by its own local municipal corporation , but rather is administered as part of larger administrative divisions , such as a township , parish , borough , county , city , canton , state , province or country . Occasionally , municipalities dissolve or disincorporate , which may happen if they become fiscally insolvent , and services become the responsibility of a higher administration . Widespread unincorporated communities and areas are a distinguishing feature of the United States and Canada . In most other countries of the world , there are either no unincorporated areas at all , or these are very rare ; typically remote , outlying , sparsely populated or uninhabited areas .",
  "/wiki/Hamlet_(place)": "A hamlet is a small or very small human settlement . In different jurisdictions and geographies , a hamlet may be the size of a town , village or parish , or may be considered to be a smaller settlement or subdivision or satellite entity to a larger settlement . The word and concept of a hamlet have roots in the Anglo-Norman settlement of England , where the old French hamlet came to apply to small human settlements . In British geography , a hamlet is considered smaller than a village and distinctly without a church or other place of worship ( e.g . one road or a crossroads , with houses either side ) .",

Though villages are often located in rural areas , the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighborhoods .

  "/wiki/Fort_McMurray": "Fort McMurray ( /m\u026ak\u02c8m\u028cri/ mik-MURR-ee ) is an urban service area in the Regional Municipality ( RM ) of Wood Buffalo in Alberta , Canada . It is located in northeast Alberta , in the middle of the Athabasca oil sands , surrounded by boreal forest . It has played a significant role in the development of the national petroleum industry .

  "/wiki/City": "A city is a large human settlement . It can be defined as a permanent and densely settled place with administratively defined boundaries whose members work primarily on non-agricultural tasks . Cities generally have extensive systems for housing , transportation , sanitation , utilities , land use , and communication . Their density facilitates interaction between people , government organisations and businesses , sometimes benefiting different parties in the process , such as improving efficiency of goods and service distribution . This concentration also can have significant negative consequences , such as forming urban heat islands , concentrating pollution , and stressing water supplies and other resources . Historically , city-dwellers have been a small proportion of humanity overall , but following two centuries of unprecedented and rapid urbanisation , roughly half of the world population now lives in cities , which has had profound consequences for global sustainability . Present-day cities usually form the core of larger metropolitan areas and urban areas - creating numerous commuters traveling towards city centres for employment , entertainment , and edification . However , in a world of intensifying globalisation , all cities are in different degree also connected globally beyond these regions . This increased influence means that cities also have significant influences on global issues , such as sustainable development , global warming and global health . The world powers feature several renowned cities , the cities of the United States , include New York City and Los Angeles , and other major cities such as Chicago , Houston , and Philadelphia . While the cities in China , rank among the most populated , for example city proper is Chongqing and the Shanghai area . While the most populous metropolitan areas are the Greater Tokyo Area , and the Jakarta metropolitan area .",
