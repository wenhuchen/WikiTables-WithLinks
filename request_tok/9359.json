  "/wiki/Aquaporin": "Aquaporins , also called water channels , are integral membrane proteins from a larger family of major intrinsic proteins that form pores in the membrane of biological cells , mainly facilitating transport of water between cells . The cell membranes of a variety of different bacteria , fungi , animal and plant cells contain aquaporins through which water can flow more rapidly into and out of the cell than by diffusing through the phospholipid bilayer . Aquaporin has six membrane-spanning alpha helical domains with both carboxylic and amino terminals on the cytoplasmic side . Two hydrophobic loops contain conserved asparagine-proline-alanine NPA motif . [ further explanation needed ] Because aquaporin is usually always open and is prevalent in just about every cell type , this leads to a misconception that water readily passes through the cell membrane down its concentration gradient . This is not true because only non-polar substances can diffuse directly through the lipid bilayer . The 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded jointly to Peter Agre for the discovery of aquaporins and Roderick MacKinnon for his work on the structure and mechanism of potassium channels . Genetic defects involving aquaporin genes have been associated with several human diseases including nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and neuromyelitis optica .",

The confrontation is often considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating into a full-scale nuclear war . In response to the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961 and the presence of American Jupiter ballistic missiles in Italy and Turkey , Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev agreed to Cuba 's request to place nuclear missiles on the island to deter a future invasion . An agreement was reached during a secret meeting between Khrushchev and Fidel Castro in July 1962 , and construction of a number of missile launch facilities started later that summer . Meanwhile , the 1962 United States elections were under way , and the White House had for months denied charges that it was ignoring dangerous Soviet missiles 90 miles ( 140 km ) from Florida . The missile preparations were confirmed when an Air Force U-2 spy plane produced clear photographic evidence of medium-range ( SS-4 ) and intermediate-range ( R-14 ) ballistic missile facilities . The US established a naval blockade on October 22 to prevent further missiles from reaching Cuba ; Oval Office tapes during the crisis revealed that Kennedy had also put the blockade in place , as an attempt to provoke Soviet-backed forces in Berlin as well . The US announced it would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba and demanded that the weapons already in Cuba be dismantled and returned to the Soviet Union . After several days of tense negotiations , an agreement was reached between US President John F. Kennedy and Khrushchev . Publicly , the Soviets would dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba and return them to the Soviet Union , subject to United Nations verification , in exchange for a US public declaration and agreement to avoid invading Cuba again .

  "/wiki/Architect": "An architect is a person who plans , designs and reviews the construction of buildings . To practice architecture means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings that have human occupancy or use as their principal purpose . Etymologically , architect derives from the Latin architectus , which derives from the Greek ( arkhi- , chief + tekton , builder ) , i.e. , chief builder . Professionally , an architect 's decisions affect public safety , and thus an architect must undergo specialized training consisting of advanced education and a practicum ( or internship ) for practical experience to earn a license to practice architecture . Practical , technical , and academic requirements for becoming an architect vary by jurisdiction .",
  "/wiki/International_Style_(architecture)": "The International Style or internationalism is a major architectural style that was developed in the 1920s and 1930s and was closely related to modernism and modern architecture . It was first defined by Museum of Modern Art curators Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson in 1932 , based on works of architecture from the 1920s . The terms rationalist architecture and modern movement are often used interchangeably with International Style , although the former is mostly used in the English-speaking world to specifically refer to the Italian rationalism of architects such as Giuseppe Terragni and Gino Pollini , or even the International Style that developed in Europe as a whole . It is defined by the Getty Research Institute as the style of architecture that emerged in Holland , France , and Germany after World War I and spread throughout the world , becoming the dominant architectural style until the 1970s . The style is characterized by an emphasis on volume over mass , the use of lightweight , mass-produced , industrial materials , rejection of all ornament and colour , repetitive modular forms , and the use of flat surfaces , typically alternating with areas of glass .",
  "/wiki/Neil_Armstrong": "Neil Alden Armstrong ( August 5 , 1930 - August 25 , 2012 ) was an American astronaut and aeronautical engineer and the first person to walk on the Moon . He was also a naval aviator , test pilot , and university professor . A graduate of Purdue University , Armstrong studied aeronautical engineering ; his college tuition was paid for by the U.S. Navy under the Holloway Plan . He became a midshipman in 1949 and a naval aviator the following year . He saw action in the Korean War , flying the Grumman F9F Panther from the aircraft carrier USS Essex . In September 1951 , while making a low bombing run , Armstrong 's aircraft was damaged when it collided with an anti-aircraft cable which cut off a large portion of one wing . Armstrong was forced to bail out . After the war , he completed his bachelor 's degree at Purdue and became a test pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics ( NACA ) High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base in California . He was the project pilot on Century Series fighters and flew the North American X-15 seven times . He was also a participant in the U.S. Air Force 's Man in Space Soonest and X-20 Dyna-Soar human spaceflight programs . Armstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in the second group , which was selected in 1962 . He made his first spaceflight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966 , becoming NASA 's first civilian astronaut to fly in space .",
  "/wiki/Gemini_8": "Gemini 8 ( officially Gemini VIII ) was the sixth crewed spaceflight in NASA 's Gemini program , launched March 16 , 1966 . It was the twelfth crewed American flight and the twenty-second crewed spaceflight of all time [ including two X-15 flights higher than the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Line at 100 kilometers ( 54 nautical miles ; 62 miles ; 328,084 feet ) ] . The mission conducted the first docking of two spacecraft in orbit , but suffered the first critical in-space system failure of a U.S. spacecraft which threatened the lives of the astronauts and required an immediate abort of the mission . The crew was returned to Earth safely . Command pilot Neil Armstrong 's flight marked the second time a U.S. civilian flew into space ( Joe Walker became the first on X-15 Flight 90 ) , and the first time a U.S. civilian flew into orbit . Armstrong had resigned his commission in the United States Naval Reserve in 1960 . The Soviet Union had launched the first civilian , Valentina Tereshkova ( also the first woman ) , aboard Vostok 6 on June 16 , 1963 .",
  "/wiki/Apollo_11": "Apollo 11 was the spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon . Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin formed the American crew that landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 , 1969 , at 20:17 UTC . Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours and 39 minutes later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC ; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later . They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft , and they collected 47.5 pounds ( 21.5 kg ) of lunar material to bring back to Earth . Command module pilot Michael Collins flew the Command Module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon 's surface . Armstrong and Aldrin spent 21 hours , 36 minutes on the lunar surface at a site they named Tranquility Base before lifting off to rejoin Columbia in lunar orbit . Apollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island , Florida , on July 16 at 13:32 UTC , and it was the fifth crewed mission of NASA 's Apollo program . The Apollo spacecraft had three parts : a command module ( CM ) with a cabin for the three astronauts , the only part that returned to Earth ; a service module ( SM ) , which supported the command module with propulsion , electrical power , oxygen , and water ; and a lunar module ( LM ) that had two stages - a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit . After being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V 's third stage , the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit . Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility on July 20 . The astronauts used Eagle 's ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module . They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth .",
  "/wiki/Test_pilot": "A test pilot is an aircraft pilot with additional training to fly and evaluate experimental , newly produced and modified aircraft with specific manoeuvres known as flight test techniques . In the 1950s , test pilots were being killed at the rate of about one a week , [ citation needed ] but the risks have shrunk to a fraction of that due to the maturation of aircraft technology , better ground-testing and simulation of aircraft performance , fly-by-wire technology and lately , the use of unmanned aerial vehicles to test experimental aircraft features . Still , piloting experimental aircraft remains more dangerous than most other types of flying .",

This was the first post-War sighting in the United States that garnered nationwide news coverage and is credited with being the first of the modern era of UFO sightings , including numerous reported sightings over the next two to three weeks . Arnold 's description of the objects also led to the press quickly coining the terms flying saucer and flying disc as popular descriptive terms for UFOs .",

  "/wiki/WordPerfect": "WordPerfect ( WP ) is a word processing application , now owned by Corel , with a long history on multiple personal computer platforms . At the height of its popularity in the 1980s and early 1990s , it was the dominant player in the word-processor market . It was originally developed under contract at Brigham Young University for use on a Data General minicomputer in the late 1970s . The authors retained the rights to the program , forming Utah-based Satellite Software International ( SSI ) in 1979 to sell it ; it first came to market under the name SSI*WP in March 1980 . It moved to the operating system MS-DOS in 1982 , by which time the name WordPerfect was in use , and several greatly updated versions quickly followed . The application 's feature list was considerably more advanced than its main competition WordStar , an established program based on the operating system CP/M that failed to transition successfully onto MS-DOS , which replaced CP/M . Satellite Software International changed its name to the WordPerfect Corporation in 1985 . WordPerfect gained praise for its look of sparseness and clean display . It rapidly displaced most other systems , especially after the 4.2 release in 1986 , and it became the standard in the DOS market by version 5.1 in 1989 . Its early popularity was based partly on its availability for a wide variety of computers and operating systems , and also partly because of extensive , no-cost support , with hold jockeys entertaining users while waiting on the phone . Its dominant position ended after a failed release for Microsoft Windows , followed by a long delay before introducing an improved version , and Microsoft Word was introduced at the same time in a superior version . Word rapidly took over the market , helped by aggressive bundling deals that ultimately produced Microsoft Office , and WordPerfect was no longer the standard by the mid-1990s .",

  "/wiki/Quorum_of_the_Twelve": "In the Latter Day Saint movement , the Quorum of the Twelve ( also known as the Council of the Twelve , the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles , Council of the Twelve Apostles , or the Twelve ) is one of the governing bodies or ( quorums ) of the church hierarchy organized by the movement 's founder Joseph Smith , and patterned after the Apostles of Jesus ( see Commissioning of the Twelve Apostles ) . Members are called Apostles , with a special calling to be evangelistic ambassadors to the world . The Twelve were designated to be a body of traveling councillors with jurisdiction outside areas where the church was formally organized ( areas of the world outside of Zion or its outlying Stakes ) . The Twelve were designated as being equal in authority to the First Presidency , the Seventy , the standing presiding high council , and the High Councils of the various stakes .

  "/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints": "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , often informally known as the LDS Church or Mormon Church , is a nontrinitarian , Christian restorationist church that considers itself to be the restoration of the original church founded by Jesus Christ . The church is headquartered in Salt Lake City , Utah , in the United States , and has established congregations and built temples worldwide . According to the church , it has over 16 million members and 65,000 full-time volunteer missionaries . In 2012 , the National Council of Churches ranked the church as the fourth-largest Christian denomination in the United States , with over 6.5 million members there as of January 2018 . It is the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement founded by Joseph Smith during the early 19th century period of religious revival known as the Second Great Awakening . Adherents , often referred to as Latter-day Saints or , less formally , Mormons , view faith in Jesus Christ and his atonement as fundamental principles of their religion . Church theology includes the Christian doctrine of salvation only through Jesus Christ , though LDS doctrines regarding the nature of God and the potential of mankind differ significantly from mainstream Christianity . The church has an open canon which includes four scriptural texts : the Bible ( both Old and New Testaments ) , the Book of Mormon , the Doctrine and Covenants , and the Pearl of Great Price . Other than the Bible , the majority of the LDS canon constitutes revelation received by Joseph Smith and recorded by his scribes which includes commentary and exegesis about the Bible , texts described as lost parts of the Bible , and other works believed to be written by ancient prophets . Because of some of the doctrinal differences , Catholic , Orthodox , and several Protestant churches consider the church to be distinct and separate from mainstream Christianity . Under the doctrine of continuing revelation , Latter-day Saints believe that the church president is a modern-day prophet , seer , and revelator and that Jesus Christ , under the direction of God the Father , leads the church by revealing his will to its president . Individual members of the church believe that they can also receive personal revelation from God in conducting their lives .",
