  "/wiki/Drama": "Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance : a play , opera , mime , ballet , etc. , performed in a theatre , or on radio or television . Considered as a genre of poetry in general , the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle 's Poetics ( c. 335 BC ) - the earliest work of dramatic theory . The term drama comes from a Greek word meaning action ( Classical Greek : \u03b4\u03c1\u1fb6\u03bc\u03b1 , drama ) , which is derived from I do ( Classical Greek : \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c9 , drao ) . The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy . In English ( as was the analogous case in many other European languages ) , the word play or game ( translating the Anglo-Saxon ple\u0121an or Latin ludus ) was the standard term for dramas until William Shakespeare 's time - just as its creator was a play-maker rather than a dramatist and the building was a play-house rather than a theatre . The use of drama in a more narrow sense to designate a specific type of play dates from the modern era . Drama in this sense refers to a play that is neither a comedy nor a tragedy - for example , Zola 's Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin ( 1873 ) or Chekhov 's Ivanov ( 1887 ) . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted to describe drama as a genre within their respective media . The term radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance . May also refer to the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio . The enactment of drama in theatre , performed by actors on a stage before an audience , presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception . The structure of dramatic texts , unlike other forms of literature , is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception .",
  "/wiki/LGBT": "LGBT ( also acronymed as LGBTQ ( + ) or GLBT ) is an initialism that stands for lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender . In use since the 1990s , the term is an adaptation of the initialism LGB , which was used to replace the term gay in reference to the LGBT community beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s . Activists believed that the term gay community did not accurately represent all those to whom it referred . The initialism has become adopted into the mainstream as an umbrella term for use when labeling topics pertaining to sexuality and gender identity . For example , the LGBT Movement Advancement Project termed community centres , which have services specific to those members of the LGBT community , as LGBT community centers , in a comprehensive studies of such centres around the United States . The initialism LGBT is intended to emphasize a diversity of sexuality and gender identity-based cultures . It may be used to refer to anyone who is non-heterosexual or non-cisgender , instead of exclusively to people who are lesbian , gay , bisexual , or transgender . To recognize this inclusion , a popular variant adds the letter Q for those who identify as queer or are questioning their sexual identity ; LGBTQ has been recorded since 1996 . Those who add intersex people to LGBT groups or organizing use an extended initialism LGBTI . The two acronyms are sometimes combined to form the terms LGBTIQ or LGBT+ to encompass spectrums of sexuality and gender . Other , less common variants also exist , motivated by a desire for inclusivity , including those over twice as long which have prompted criticism .",

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece . In the Athenian democracy , the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters . The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict . Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a Society of Youth and a Society of the Old . A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes . In this struggle , the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority , and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter . Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt , thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor . Parody subverts popular genres and forms , critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them . Other forms of comedy include screwball comedy , which derives its humor largely from bizarre , surprising ( and improbable ) situations or characters , and black comedy , which is characterized by a form of humor that includes darker aspects of human behavior or human nature . Similarly scatological humor , sexual humor , and race humor create comedy by violating social conventions or taboos in comic ways . A comedy of manners typically takes as its subject a particular part of society ( usually upper-class society ) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members .",

  "/wiki/Historical": "History ( from Greek \u1f31\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 , historia , meaning 'inquiry ; knowledge acquired by investigation ' ) is the past as it is described in written documents , and the study thereof . Events occurring before written records are considered prehistory . History is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory , discovery , collection , organization , presentation , and interpretation of information about these events . Scholars who write about history are called historians . History also includes the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a sequence of past events , and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them . Historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing perspective on the problems of the present . Stories common to a particular culture , but not supported by external sources ( such as the tales surrounding King Arthur ) , are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends , because they do not show the disinterested investigation required of the discipline of history . Herodotus , a 5th-century BC Greek historian is often considered within the Western tradition to be the father of history , or by some the father of lies , and , along with his contemporary Thucydides , helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history . Their works continue to be read today , and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing . In East Asia , a state chronicle , the Spring and Autumn Annals , was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts have survived . Ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today . The modern study of history is wide-ranging , and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation .",

  "/wiki/Musical_theatre": "Musical theatre is a form of theatrical performance that combines songs , spoken dialogue , acting and dance . The story and emotional content of a musical - humor , pathos , love , anger - are communicated through words , music , movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole . Although musical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like opera and dance , it may be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music as compared with the dialogue , movement and other elements . Since the early 20th century , musical theatre stage works have generally been called , simply , musicals . Although music has been a part of dramatic presentations since ancient times , modern Western musical theatre emerged during the 19th century , with many structural elements established by the works of Gilbert and Sullivan in Britain and those of Harrigan and Hart in America . These were followed by the numerous Edwardian musical comedies and the musical theatre works of American creators like George M. Cohan at the turn of the 20th century . The Princess Theatre musicals ( 1915-1918 ) and other smart shows like Of Thee I Sing ( 1931 ) were artistic steps forward beyond revues and other frothy entertainments of the early 20th century and led to such groundbreaking works as Show Boat ( 1927 ) and Oklahoma ! ( 1943 ) . Some of the most famous musicals through the decades that followed include West Side Story ( 1957 ) , The Fantasticks ( 1960 ) , Hair ( 1967 ) , A Chorus Line ( 1975 ) , Les Mis\u00e9rables ( 1985 ) , The Phantom of the Opera ( 1986 ) , Rent ( 1996 ) , The Producers ( 2001 ) , Wicked ( 2003 ) and Hamilton ( 2015 ) .
