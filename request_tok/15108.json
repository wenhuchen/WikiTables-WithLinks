  "/wiki/White_River,_California": "White River is a little unincorporated community in Tulare County , ten miles east of Delano , California , United States . It was founded as a gold camp in 1856 , during the Kern River Gold Rush . It was first located on the Coarse Gold Gulch two miles west of the present site and was called Dogtown . When the first road was built to Linn 's Valley , Dogtown was moved a mile and a half west to the road . Its name was changed to Tailholt after one of the first stagecoaches to stop in town provided the new name , due to a humorous incident . It involved a lady passenger on the stagecoach that grabbed the tail of her dog as it jumped out the window in pursuit of a cat . She hung on screaming for help until the owner of the local restaurant , Mother Cummings , came to her rescue . While she was lifting the dog through the window of the coach she said , Well Ma'am , a tail-holt is better than a no holt at all . The coach driver , Yank , on his return to Visalia told the postmaster and keeper of the stage station there that the new name of the town was Tailholt . Its name was later changed to the more respectable title of White River . Among the points of interest are two cemeteries , one north of the river for regular citizens , and a small one , the Tailholt Boot Hill Cemetery , south of the river for those the town did not want in their cemetery , like Jack Gordon , ( formerly Peter Worthington ) , who died violently in a gunfight and was a known member of the Mason Henry Gang .",
