Upon completion , Diamer-Bhasha Dam would ( i ) produce 4800 megawatts of electricity through hydro-power generation ; ( ii ) store an extra 10.5 cubic kilometres ( 8,500,000 acre\u22c5ft ) of water for Pakistan that would be used for irrigation and drinking ; ( iii ) extend the life of Tarbela Dam located downstream by 35 years ; and ( iv ) control flood damage by the River Indus downstream during high floods . However , in response to using Basha Dam to sideline the Kalabagh Dam , Engineer Anwer Khurshid has stated that Bhasha dam is no substitute for Kalabagh dam not because of its altitude which is high enough , but because no irrigation canals can be taken out from it because of the hilly terrain . No canals can be taken out from any dam on the Indus except from Kalabagh Dam . It is planned to have a height of 272 meters spillway with fourteen gates each 11.5 m \u00d7 16.24 m.

The province is the site of the ancient kingdom Gandhara , including the ruins of its capital Pushkalavati near modern-day Charsadda . Originally a stronghold of Buddhism , the history of the region was characterized by frequent invasions by various empires due to its geographical proximity to the Khyber Pass . Since the 9/11 attacks in the United States in 2001 , the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been a major theatre of militancy and terrorism which intensified when the Taliban began an unsuccessful attempt to seize the control of the province in 2004 . With the launch of Operation Zarb-e-Azb against the Taliban insurgency , the casualty and crime rates in the country as a whole dropped by 40.0% as compared to 2011-13 , with even greater drops noted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas . As of July 2014 , about 929,859 people were reported to be internally displaced from North Waziristan to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as a result of Operation Zarb-e-Azb .

A scholar of Kal\u0101m is referred to as a mutakallim ( plural : mutakallim\u016bn ) , and it is a role distinguished from those of Islamic philosophers , jurists , and scientists .
