Due to rapid urbanization , the city expanded to the west of the lagoon to include areas in the present day Lagos Mainland , Ajeromi-Ifelodun and Surulere . This led to the classification of Lagos into two main areas : the Island , which was the initial city of Lagos , before it expanded into the area known as the Mainland . This city area was governed directly by the Federal Government through the Lagos City Council , until the creation of Lagos State in 1967 , which led to the splitting of Lagos city into the present day seven Local Government Areas ( LGAs ) , and an addition of other towns ( which now make up 13 LGAs ) from the then Western Region to form the state . Lagos , the capital of Nigeria since its amalgamation in 1914 , went on to become the capital of Lagos State after its creation . However , the state capital was later moved to Ikeja in 1976 , and the federal capital moved to Abuja in 1991 . Even though Lagos is still widely referred to as a city , the present day Lagos , also known as Metropolitan Lagos , and officially as Lagos Metropolitan Area is an urban agglomeration or conurbation , consisting of 20 LGAs , 37 LCDAs including Ikeja , the state capital of Lagos State .",
