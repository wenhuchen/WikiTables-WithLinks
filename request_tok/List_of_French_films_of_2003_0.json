In UK the distribution company altered the order of the trilogy placing the second film as the first one . In the DVD commentary , Belvaux explained that the main idea behind Trilogy is that the main characters in a particular story can be seen as the secondary characters in others ; the three films happen at the same time and share a series of common scenes and plot points , complementing each other , but each has its own perspective and style . The audience is left with the duty of piecing the films together , which Belvaux avoided , since editing the three films into one single narrative would have resulted in a very long film with no style of its own .",

After training as a film editor in the mid-1940s , he went on to direct a number of short films which included Night and Fog ( 1956 ) , an influential documentary about the Nazi concentration camps . Resnais began making feature films in the late 1950s and consolidated his early reputation with Hiroshima mon amour ( 1959 ) , Last Year at Marienbad ( 1961 ) , and Muriel ( 1963 ) , all of which adopted unconventional narrative techniques to deal with themes of troubled memory and the imagined past . These films were contemporary with , and associated with , the French New Wave ( la nouvelle vague ) , though Resnais did not regard himself as being fully part of that movement . He had closer links to the Left Bank group of authors and filmmakers who shared a commitment to modernism and an interest in left-wing politics . He also established a regular practice of working on his films in collaboration with writers previously unconnected with the cinema such as Jean Cayrol , Marguerite Duras , Alain Robbe-Grillet , Jorge Sempr\u00fan and Jacques Sternberg . In later films , Resnais moved away from the overtly political topics of some previous works and developed his interests in an interaction between cinema and other cultural forms , including theatre , music , and comic books . This led to imaginative adaptations of plays by Alan Ayckbourn , Henri Bernstein and Jean Anouilh , as well as films featuring various kinds of popular song . His films frequently explore the relationship between consciousness , memory , and the imagination , and he was noted for devising innovative formal structures for his narratives . Throughout his career , he won many awards from international film festivals and academies .",

He made twenty-nine films , including L'amour fou ( 1969 ) , Out 1 ( 1971 ) , Celine and Julie Go Boating ( 1974 ) , and La Belle Noiseuse ( 1991 ) . His work is noted for its improvisation , loose narratives , and lengthy running times . Inspired by Jean Cocteau to become a filmmaker , Rivette shot his first short film at age twenty . He moved to Paris to pursue his career , frequenting Henri Langlois ' Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise and other cin\u00e9-clubs ; there , he met Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut , Jean-Luc Godard , \u00c9ric Rohmer , Claude Chabrol and other future members of the New Wave . Rivette began writing film criticism , and was hired by Andr\u00e9 Bazin for Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma in 1953 . In his criticism , he expressed an admiration for American films - especially those of genre directors such as John Ford , Alfred Hitchcock and Nicholas Ray - and was deeply critical of mainstream French cinema . Rivette 's articles , admired by his peers , were considered the magazine 's best and most aggressive writings , particularly his 1961 article On Abjection and his influential series of interviews with film directors co-written with Truffaut . He continued making short films , including Le Coup de Berger , which is often cited as the first New Wave film . Truffaut later credited Rivette with developing the movement . Although he was the first New Wave director to begin work on a feature film , Paris Belongs to Us was not released until 1961 , by which time Chabrol , Truffaut and Godard released their own first features and popularised the movement worldwide . Rivette became editor of Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma during the early 1960s and publicly fought French censorship of his second feature film , The Nun ( 1966 ) .",

The plot focuses on a British crime novelist , Sarah Morton , who travels to her publisher 's upmarket summer house in Southern France to seek solitude in order to work on her next book . However , the arrival of Julie , who claims to be the publisher 's daughter , induces complications and a subsequent crime . While the film 's protagonist is British and both of the lead characters are bilingual , the majority of the story takes place in France - thus , the dialogue throughout the film is a mixture of French and English . Swimming Pool premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on 18 May 2003 , and was released theatrically in France three days later , with a U cinema rating , meaning it was deemed suitable for all ages . It was given a limited release in the United States that July , and was edited in order to avoid an NC-17 rating due to its sexual content and nudity . It was subsequently released in North America on DVD in an unrated cut . The film ignited controversy with audiences because of its ambiguous nature and unclear conclusion which can be interpreted and argued in various ways - while in France many comparisons were made with Jacques Deray 's 1969 film La Piscine ( The Swimming Pool ) , starring Romy Schneider and Alain Delon .",
