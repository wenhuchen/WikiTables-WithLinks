  "/wiki/Continental_Congress": "The Continental Congress was initially a convention of delegates from a number of British American colonies at the height of the American Revolution , who acted collectively for the people of the Thirteen Colonies that ultimately became the United States of America . After declaring the colonies independent from the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1776 , it acted as the provisional governing structure for the collective United States , while most government functions remained in the individual states . The term most specifically refers to the First Continental Congress of 1774 and the Second Continental Congress of 1775-1781 . More broadly , it also refers to the Congress of the Confederation of 1781-1789 , thus covering the three congressional bodies of the Thirteen Colonies and the United States that met between 1774 and the inauguration of a new government in 1789 under the United States Constitution . Convened in response to the Intolerable Acts passed by the British Parliament in 1774 , the First Continental Congress sought to help repair the frayed relationship between the British government and its American colonies while also asserting the rights of colonists . The Second Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence in July 1776 , proclaiming that the 13 colonies were now independent sovereign states , no longer under British rule . This body functioned as the provisional government for the U.S. until the nation 's first Frame of Government , the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union , came into force on March 1 , 1781 , at which time it became the Congress of the Confederation . Officially styled The United States in Congress Assembled , this unicameral governing body would convene in eight sessions ( a ninth would fail to achieve a quorum ) prior to being disbanded in 1789 , when the 1st United States Congress under the new constitution took over the role as the nation 's legislative branch of government . Much of what is known today about the daily activities of these congresses comes from the journals kept by the secretary for all three congresses , Charles Thomson . Printed contemporaneously , the Papers of the Continental Congress contain the official congressional papers , letters , treaties , reports and records . The delegates to the Continental and Confederation congresses had extensive experience in deliberative bodies , with a cumulative total of nearly 500 years of experience in their Colonial assemblies , and fully a dozen of them had served as speakers of the houses of their legislatures .",
  "/wiki/House_of_Burgesses": "The House of Burgesses /\u02c8b\u025c\u02d0rd\u0292\u0259s\u026az/ was the elected representative element of the Virginia General Assembly , the legislative body of the Colony of Virginia . With the creation of the House of Burgesses in 1642 , the General Assembly , which had been established in 1619 , became a bicameral institution . From 1642 to 1776 , the House of Burgesses was an instrument of government alongside the royally-appointed colonial governor and the upper-house Council of State in the General Assembly . When the Virginia colony declared its independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain at the Fifth Virginia Convention in 1776 and became the independent Commonwealth of Virginia , the House of Burgesses became the House of Delegates , which continues to serve as the lower house of the General Assembly .",
  "/wiki/Stamp_Act": "A stamp act is any legislation that requires a tax to be paid on the transfer of certain documents . Those who pay the tax receive an official stamp on their documents , making them legal documents . A variety of products have been covered by stamp acts including playing cards , dice , patent medicines , cheques , mortgages , contracts , marriage licenses and newspapers . The items often have to be physically stamped at approved government offices following payment of the duty , although methods involving annual payment of a fixed sum or purchase of adhesive stamps are more practical and common . This system of taxation was first devised in the Netherlands in 1624 after a public competition to find a new form of tax . Stamp acts have been enforced in many countries , including Australia , Canada , People 's Republic of China , Ireland , India , Malaysia , Israel , the United Kingdom , and the United States of America . The taxes raised under a stamp act are called stamp duty .",

  "/wiki/Wren_Building": "The Wren Building is the signature building of the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg , Virginia , USA . Along with the Brafferton and President 's House , these buildings form the College 's Ancient Campus . With a construction history dating to 1695 , it is the oldest academic building in continuous use in the United States . It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960 . Construction of the first building on this site began August 8 , 1695 and was completed by 1700 . After several fires and rebuildings , the Wren Building was the first major building restored or reconstructed by John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , after he and the Reverend Dr. W.A.R . Goodwin began Colonial Williamsburg 's restoration in the late 1920s . The building 's current state dates to the 20th-century restoration by Boston architects Perry Shaw & Hepburn . The College named the building in honor of the English architect Sir Christopher Wren , after the Reverend Hugh Jones , a William and Mary mathematics professor , wrote in 1724 that the College Building was modeled by Sir Christopher Wren . However , it is unknown how Jones came to this conclusion , since there are no actual documents tying Sir Christopher Wren to the design of the building ; he never even visited North America . Perry Shaw and Hepburn 's restoration reflects the building 's historic appearance from its reconstruction in 1716 after a 1705 fire to 1859 , when it burned again . The building is constructed out of red brick in the style of Flemish and English Bond , as was typical for official buildings in 17th- and 18th-century Williamsburg , including several walls remaining from previous structures , and it contains classrooms , offices , a refectory ( known as the Great Hall ) , kitchen , and a chapel ( added as a south wing in 1732 ) .",
