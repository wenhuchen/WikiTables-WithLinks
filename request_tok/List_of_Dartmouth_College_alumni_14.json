  "/wiki/Tuck_School_of_Business": "The Tuck School of Business ( also known as Tuck , and formally known as the Amos Tuck School of Administration and Finance ) is the graduate business school of Dartmouth College , an Ivy League research university in Hanover , New Hampshire . Founded in 1900 through a donation made by Dartmouth alumnus Edward Tuck , the Tuck School was the first institution in the world to offer a master 's degree in business administration . The Tuck School awards only one degree , the Master of Business Administration degree , through a full-time , residential program . The school does not offer an Executive MBA or a part-time program , believing that such programs , while lucrative , would dilute the focus of its full-time MBA program . Tuck does , however , offer an Advanced Management Program for executives , which spans either one or two weeks depending on the course . In addition , Tuck offers a 4-week , intensive summer program to liberal arts students seeking to build a foundation in core business concepts . Within Dartmouth , faculty from Tuck and The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice are partnering to offer a Master of Health Care Delivery Science degree from Dartmouth College . Moreover , Tuck partners with the Thayer School of Engineering to teach management courses through a Master of Engineering Management program offered by Thayer School of Engineering . Compared to other elite business schools , Tuck is known for its rural setting and small class size - each MBA class consists of about 280 students . As such , both factors , combined with Tuck 's commitment to the full-time MBA program attribute to its high giving rate among the 10,300 Tuck alumni across 73 countries . Almost 70% of all Tuck alumni regularly give to the school , the highest rate among business schools worldwide . The MBA program has held a top-10 ranking in multiple publications , including U.S. News & World Report , Bloomberg , The Economist , Forbes , Business Insider , and Vault .",
