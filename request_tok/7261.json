Originally a Dutch village , formally organized in 1658 , it is named after the city of Haarlem in the Netherlands . Harlem 's history has been defined by a series of economic boom-and-bust cycles , with significant population shifts accompanying each cycle . Harlem was predominantly occupied by Jewish and Italian Americans in the 19th century , but African-American residents began to arrive in large numbers during the Great Migration in the 20th century . In the 1920s and 1930s , Central and West Harlem were the focus of the Harlem Renaissance , a major African-American cultural movement . With job losses during the Great Depression of the 1930s and the deindustrialization of New York City after World War II , rates of crime and poverty increased significantly . In the 21st century , crime rates decreased significantly , and Harlem started to gentrify . Harlem is part of Manhattan Community District 10 .

  "/wiki/Pennsylvania_Station_(1910\u20131963)": "Pennsylvania Station was a historic railroad station in New York City , named for the Pennsylvania Railroad ( PRR ) , its builder and original tenant . The station occupied an 8-acre ( 3.2 ha ) plot bounded by Seventh and Eighth Avenues and 31st and 33rd Streets in Midtown Manhattan . As the terminal shared its name with several stations in other cities , it was sometimes called New York Pennsylvania Station , or Penn Station for short . The building was designed by McKim , Mead , and White and completed in 1910 , enabling direct rail access to New York City from the south for the first time . Its head house and train shed were considered a masterpiece of the Beaux-Arts style and one of the great architectural works of New York City . The station contained 11 platforms serving 21 tracks , in approximately the same layout as the current Penn Station . The original building was one of the first stations to include separate waiting rooms for arriving and departing passengers , and when built , these were among the city 's largest public spaces . Passenger traffic began to decline after World War II , and in the 1950s , the Pennsylvania Railroad sold the air rights to the property and shrank the railroad station . Starting in 1963 , the above-ground head house and train shed were demolished , a loss that galvanized the modern historic preservation movement in the United States . Over the next six years , the below-ground concourses and waiting areas were heavily renovated , becoming the modern Penn Station , while Madison Square Garden and Pennsylvania Plaza were built above them . The sole remaining portions of the original station are the underground platforms and tracks , as well as scattered artifacts on the mezzanine level above it .",

Flushing Meadows-Corona Park is the fourth-largest public park in New York City , with a total area of 897 acres ( 363 ha ) . The site of the park was once geologically part of the Hudson River . Starting in the first decade of the 20th century , it was used as a dumping ground for ashes , since at the time , the land was so far away from the developed parts of New York City as to be considered almost worthless . New York City Parks Commissioner Robert Moses first conceived the idea of developing a large park in Flushing Meadow in the 1920s as part of a system of parks across eastern Queens . Flushing Meadows-Corona Park was created as the site of the 1939 New York World 's Fair and also hosted the 1964 New York World 's Fair .
