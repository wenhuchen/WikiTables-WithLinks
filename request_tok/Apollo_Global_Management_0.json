The killings outraged Iraqis and strained relations between Iraq and the United States . In 2014 , four Blackwater employees were tried and convicted in U.S. federal court ; one of murder , and the other three of manslaughter and firearms charges . Blackwater guards claimed that the convoy was ambushed and that they fired at the attackers in defense of the convoy . The Iraqi government and Iraqi police investigator Faris Saadi Abdul stated that the killings were unprovoked . The next day , Blackwater Worldwide 's license to operate in Iraq was temporarily revoked . The U.S. State Department has said that innocent life was lost , and according to the Washington Post , a military report appeared to corroborate the Iraqi government 's contention that Blackwater was at fault .

The FBI investigation found that , of the 17 Iraqis killed by the guards , at least 14 were shot without cause . In December 2008 , the U.S. charged five Blackwater guards with 14 counts of manslaughter , 20 counts of attempted manslaughter and a weapons violation but on December 31 , 2009 , a U.S. district judge dismissed all charges on the grounds that the case against the Blackwater guards had been improperly built on testimony given in exchange for immunity .

  "/wiki/Secured_loan": "A secured loan is a loan in which the borrower pledges some asset ( e.g . a car or property ) as collateral for the loan , which then becomes a secured debt owed to the creditor who gives the loan . The debt is thus secured against the collateral , and if the borrower defaults , the creditor takes possession of the asset used as collateral and may sell it to regain some or all of the amount originally loaned to the borrower . An example is the foreclosure of a home . From the creditor 's perspective , that is a category of debt in which a lender has been granted a portion of the bundle of rights to specified property . If the sale of the collateral does not raise enough money to pay off the debt , the creditor can often obtain a deficiency judgment against the borrower for the remaining amount . The opposite of secured debt/loan is unsecured debt , which is not connected to any specific piece of property . Instead , the creditor may satisfy the debt only against the borrower , rather than the borrower 's collateral and the borrower . Generally speaking , secured debt may attract lower interest rates than unsecured debt because of the added security for the lender ; however , credit risk ( e.g . credit history , and ability to repay ) and expected returns for the lender are also factors affecting rates . The term secured loan is used in the United Kingdom , but the United States more commonly uses secured debt .",
