  "/wiki/Fran\u00e7ois_Sudre": "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Sudre ( 15 August 1787 - 3 October 1862 ) was a violinist , composer and music teacher who invented a musical language called la Langue musicale universelle or Solr\u00e9sol . Sudre was born in Albi in southern France on 15 August 1787 . He studied music as a child and , at the age of eighteen , was admitted to the Conservatoire de Paris on 12 May 1806 , where he studied violin under Fran\u00e7ois Habeneck and harmony under Charles Simon Catel . He created a group of musicians who were attempting to develop a way of transmitting language through music . Sudre trained \u00c9douard Deldevez and Charles Larsonneur to play and interpret his alphabet . A given note would represent a word or a letter of the alphabet . The trio toured France , answering questions from the audience using Sudre 's violin . A military application quickly presented itself . A bugler on a battlefield could transmit orders to a regiment by playing an appropriate tune . This promising hypothesis came to nothing because the system was too vulnerable to wind and weather . Clearly grasping at straws , Sudre then offered the military a set of musical canons , but they declined the suggestion . In 1829 Sudre began to develop the system that is now known as the Do Re Mi method of notating music .",
  "/wiki/Solfege": "In music , solf\u00e8ge ( UK : /\u02c8s\u0252lf\u025bd\u0292/ , US : /s\u0252l\u02c8f\u025b\u0292/ ; French : [ s\u0254lf\u025b\u0292 ] ) or solfeggio ( /s\u0252l\u02c8f\u025bd\u0292io\u028a/ ; Italian : [ sol\u02c8fedd\u0292o ] ) , also called sol-fa , solfa , solfeo , among many names , is a music education method used to teach aural skills , pitch and sight-reading of Western music . Solf\u00e8ge is a form of solmization , and though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably , this system originated from other Eastern music cultures such as swara , durar mufa\u1e63\u1e63al\u0101t and Jianpu . Syllables are assigned to the notes of the scale and enable the musician to audiate , or mentally hear , the pitches of a piece of music which he or she is seeing for the first time and then to sing them aloud . Through the Renaissance ( and much later in some shapenote publications ) various interlocking 4 , 5 and 6-note systems were employed to cover the octave . The tonic sol-fa method popularized the seven syllables commonly used in English-speaking countries : do ( or doh in tonic sol-fa ) , re , mi , fa , so ( l ) , la , and si ( or ti ) , see below ) . There are two current ways of applying solf\u00e8ge : 1 ) fixed do , where the syllables are always tied to specific pitches ( e.g . do is always C-natural ) and 2 ) movable do , where the syllables are assigned to scale degrees ( do is always the first degree of the major scale ) .",

It was created by Polish ophthalmologist L. L. Zamenhof in 1887 , when he published a book detailing the language , Unua Libro ( First Book ) , under the pseudonym Dr. Esperanto . The word esperanto translates into English as one who hopes . Zamenhof 's goal was to create an easy and flexible language that would serve as a universal second language to foster world peace and international understanding , and to build a community of speakers , as he believed that one could not have a language without such a community . His original title for the language was simply the international language ( lingvo internacia ) , but early speakers grew fond of the name Esperanto and began to use it as the name for the language just two years after its creation ; the name quickly gained prominence and has been used as an official name ever since . In 1905 , Zamenhof published Fundamento de Esperanto as a definitive guide to the language . Later that year , he organized the first World Esperanto Congress , an ongoing annual conference , in Boulogne-sur-Mer , France . The first congress ratified the Declaration of Boulogne , which established several foundational premises for the Esperanto movement ; one of its pronouncements is that Fundamento de Esperanto is the only obligatory authority over the language ; another is that the Esperanto movement is exclusively a linguistic movement and that no further meaning can ever be ascribed to it . Zamenhof also proposed to the first congress that an independent body of linguistic scholars should steward the future evolution of Esperanto , foreshadowing the founding of the Akademio de Esperanto ( in part modeled after the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise ) , which was established soon thereafter . Since 1905 , the congress has been held in a different country every year , with the exceptions of those years during the World Wars . In 1908 , a group of young Esperanto speakers led by the Swiss Hector Hodler established the Universal Esperanto Association in order to provide a central organization for the global Esperanto community .

Zamenhof first developed the language in 1873 while still in school . He grew up fascinated by the idea of a world without war . He believed that this could happen with the help of a new international auxiliary language . The language would be a tool to gather people together through neutral , fair , equitable communication . He successfully formed a community that continues today despite the World Wars of the 20th century .

Ido was specifically designed to be grammatically , orthographically , and lexicographically regular , and above all easy to learn and use . In this sense , Ido is classified as a constructed international auxiliary language . It is the most successful of many Esperanto derivatives , called Esperantidos . Ido was created in 1907 out of a desire to reform perceived flaws in Esperanto , a language that had been created 20 years earlier to facilitate international communication . The name of the language traces its origin to the Esperanto word ido , meaning offspring , since the language is a descendant of Esperanto . After its inception , Ido gained support from some in the Esperanto community , but following the sudden death in 1914 of one of its most influential proponents , Louis Couturat , it declined in popularity . There were two reasons for this : first , the emergence of further schisms arising from competing reform projects ; and second , a general lack of awareness of Ido as a candidate for an international language . These obstacles weakened the movement and it was not until the rise of the Internet that it began to regain momentum . Ido uses the same 26 letters as the English ( Latin ) alphabet , with no diacritics .

The vocabulary is based on already existing words from various languages and a system of derivation using recognized prefixes and suffixes . The language is thereby naturalistic , at the same time as it is constructed to be regular . Occidental was quite popular in the years up to , during , and shortly after the Second World War , but declined thereafter . Occidental is devised so that many of its derived word forms reflect the forms common to a number of Western European languages , primarily those in the Romance family , along with a certain amount of Germanic vocabulary . Many words were formed through application of de Wahl 's rule , a set of rules for regular conversion of verb infinitives into derived words including from double-stem verbs of Latin origin ( e.g . vider to see and its derivative vision ) . The result is a language easy to understand at first sight for individuals acquainted with several Western European languages . This readability and simplified grammar along with the regular appearance of the magazine Cosmoglotta made Occidental popular in Europe during the 15 years before World War II . In The Esperanto Book , Don Harlow says that Occidental had an intentional emphasis on European forms , and that some of its leading followers espoused a Eurocentric philosophy , which may have hindered its spread . Still , Occidental gained adherents in many nations including Asian nations . Occidental survived World War II , undergoing a name change to Interlingue , but faded into insignificance following the appearance in 1951 of a competing naturalistic project , Interlingua , which attracted among others the notable Occidentalist Ric Berger .",

The word Sona in the language itself means auxiliary neutral thing , but the name was also chosen to echo sonority or sound . [ citation needed ] Searight created Sona as a response to the Eurocentricity of other artificial auxiliary languages of his time , such as Esperanto and Ido . At the same time , Searight intended his language to be more practical than most a priori languages like Solresol or Ro , which were intended to be unbiased by any particular group of natural languages . Thus , Sona sacrificed familiarity of grammar and lexicon for some measure of universality , while at the same time preserving basic notions common to grammars around the world such as compounding as a method of word formation . Searight used inspiration from many diverse languages , including English , Arabic , Turkish , Chinese and Japanese , to create his eclectic yet regular and logical language . Searight specifically chose only sounds that speakers of many languages could say , therefore making it a true universal . He hoped that in a perfect world , Sona would be taught to young children everywhere . Sona is an agglutinative language with a strong tendency towards being an isolating language . The language has 360 radicals or root words whose meanings are based on the categories in Roget 's original thesaurus , plus an additional 15 particles .

Esperanto II was one of several languages investigated by the International Auxiliary Language Association , the linguistic research body that eventually standardized and presented Interlingua de IALA . Several of the grammatical inflections were changed . The accusative is in -u , which replaces the final vowel of nouns , pronouns , and correlatives ( ju for \u011din , tu for tion ) , and for the plural -n is added to both nouns and pronouns ( lin they , lina their ) . Neither suffix affects adjectives , which do not agree with their noun . The correlative series tiu , \u0109iu becomes ta , cha when modifying a noun . The indefinite suffix -a\u016d is replaced with adverbial -e , and the inchoative -i\u011d- becomes -ev- . Many small grammatical words are also replaced , such as ey for kaj and , be for \u0109e at , and ki for ol than . The work of the preposition de of , by , from is divided up into several more specific prepositions . Additionally , the project introduced international cognates when such cognates were readily recognized ; for example , skolo was used for school in place of standard Esperanto 's lernejo ( a derivation of lerni , to learn ) ; Esperanto has skolo only in the sense of a school of thought , which is also the eaning that the word has in the example passage below .
