Whereas previous trade weeks had run from Monday to Friday , the 2010 trade week was originally scheduled to run from Monday 4 October to Monday 11 October .

These were the trade week; held between (5 October and 12 October), the national draft; held on the (18 November), the pre-season draft (7 December) and the rookie draft (also held on 7 December). This was the first national draft to feature the Gold Coast Suns, ahead of their AFL debut season in 2011. Greater Western Sydney, who joined the league in 2012, only took part in the rookie draft."
