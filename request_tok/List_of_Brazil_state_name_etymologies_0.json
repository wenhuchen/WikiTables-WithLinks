It occupies an area of 152,581.4 km2 . Its capital and largest city is Rio Branco . Other important places include Cruzeiro do Sul , Sena Madureira , Tarauac\u00e1 and Feij\u00f3 . Intense extractive activity , which reached its height in the 20th century , attracted Brazilians from many regions to the state . From the mixture of sulista , southeastern Brazil , nordestino , and indigenous traditions arose a diverse cuisine , which unites sun-dried meat ( carne-de-sol ) with pirarucu , a typical fish of the region . Such dishes are seasoned with tucupi , a sauce made from manioc . Fluvial transport , concentrated on the Juru\u00e1 and Moa rivers , in the western part of the state , and the Tarauac\u00e1 and Envira Rivers in the northwest , is the principal form of transportation , especially between November and June , when rain leaves impassable the BR-364 , which connects Rio Branco to Cruzeiro do Sul .",

It is traditionally defined as the area of one chain by one furlong ( 66 by 660 feet ) , which is exactly equal to 10 square chains , \u200b1\u2044640 of a square mile , or 43,560 square feet , and approximately 4,047 m2 , or about 40% of a hectare . Based upon the International yard and pound agreement of 1959 , an acre may be declared as exactly 4,046.8564224 square metres . An internationally recognised symbol for the acre is ac . The acre is a statute measure in the United States , in the United Kingdom and in almost all countries of the former British Empire : in most it is lawful to 'use for trade ' if given as supplementary information and is not used for land registration . In the United States both the international acre and the US survey acre are in use , but they differ by only two parts per million : see below . The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land . Traditionally , in the Middle Ages , an acre was defined as the area of land that could be ploughed in one day by a yoke of oxen .",

It is a global language , the world 's second-most spoken native language , after Mandarin Chinese , and the world 's fourth-most spoken language , after Mandarin Chinese , English and Hindi . Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages , which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century . The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century , and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo , a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile , in the 13th century . Beginning in 1492 , the Spanish language was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire , most notably to the Americas , as well as territories in Africa , Oceania and the Philippines . A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages . Additionally , it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages , particularly other Romance languages - French , Italian , Andalusi Romance , Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Occitan , and Sardinian - as well as from Quechua , Nahuatl , and other indigenous languages of the Americas .

The Mantaro and Apur\u00edmac join , and with other tributaries form the Ucayali River , which in turn meets the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River upstream of Iquitos , Peru , to form what countries other than Brazil consider to be the main stem of the Amazon .

Apollonius Rhodius , in his Argonautica , mentions that the Amazons were the daughters of Ares and Harmonia ( a nymph of the Akmonian Wood ) , that they were brutal and aggressive , and their main concern in life was war . Lysias , Isocrates , Philostratus the Elder also say that their father was Ares . Herodotus and Strabo place them on the banks of the Thermodon River . According to Diodorus , giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene ( who in turn drew on Thymoetas ) , the Amazons inhabited Ancient Libya long before they settled along the Thermodon . Migrating from Libya , these Amazons passed through Egypt and Syria , and stopped at the Ca\u00efcus in Aeolis , near which they founded several cities . Later , Diodorus maintains , they established Mytilene a little way beyond the Ca\u00efcus . Aeschylus , in Prometheus Bound , places the original home of the Amazons in the country about Lake Maeotis , and from which they moved to Themiscyra on the Thermodon . Homer tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near Lycia . Notable queens of the Amazons are Penthesilea , who participated in the Trojan War , and her sister Hippolyta , whose magical girdle , given to her by her father Ares , was the object of one of the labours of Heracles . The Amazons fought on the side of Troy against the Greeks during the Trojan War . Diodorus mentions that the Amazons traveled from Libya under Queen Myrina .",

It has the longest documented history of any living Indo-European language , spanning at least 3,500 years of written records . Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the major part of its history ; other systems , such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary , were used previously . The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin , Cyrillic , Armenian , Coptic , Gothic , and many other writing systems . The Greek language holds an important place in the history of the Western world and Christianity ; the canon of ancient Greek literature includes works in the Western canon such as the epic poems Iliad and Odyssey . Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science , especially astronomy , mathematics and logic and Western philosophy , such as the Platonic dialogues and the works of Aristotle , are composed ; the New Testament of the Christian Bible was written in Koin\u00e9 Greek . Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world , the study of the Greek texts and society of antiquity constitutes the discipline of Classics . During antiquity , Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world , West Asia and many places beyond . It would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire and develop into Medieval Greek . In its modern form , Greek is the official language in two countries , Greece and Cyprus , a recognised minority language in seven other countries , and is one of the 24 official languages of the European Union . The language is spoken by at least 13.2 million people today in Greece , Cyprus , Italy , Albania , and Turkey and by the Greek diaspora .

The legends surrounding El Dorado changed over time , as it went from being a man , to a city , to a kingdom , and then finally to an empire . A second location for El Dorado was inferred from rumors , which inspired several unsuccessful expeditions in the late 1500s in search of a city called Man\u00f5a on the shores of Lake Parime . Two of the most famous of these expeditions were led by Sir Walter Raleigh . In pursuit of the legend , Spanish conquistadors and numerous others searched what is today Colombia , Venezuela , and parts of Guyana and northern Brazil , for the city and its fabulous king . In the course of these explorations , much of northern South America , including the Amazon River , was mapped .

  "/wiki/Gold": "Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au ( from Latin : aurum ) and atomic number 79 , making it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally . In its purest form , it is a bright , slightly reddish yellow , dense , soft , malleable , and ductile metal . Chemically , gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element . It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions . Gold often occurs in free elemental ( native ) form , as nuggets or grains , in rocks , in veins , and in alluvial deposits . It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver ( as electrum ) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium . Less commonly , it occurs in minerals as gold compounds , often with tellurium ( gold tellurides ) . Gold is resistant to most acids , though it does dissolve in aqua regia , a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid , which forms a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion . Gold is insoluble in nitric acid , which dissolves silver and base metals , a property that has long been used to refine gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic objects , giving rise to the term acid test . Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide , which are used in mining and electroplating . Gold dissolves in mercury , forming amalgam alloys , but this is not a chemical reaction . A relatively rare element , gold is a precious metal that has been used for coinage , jewelry , and other arts throughout recorded history .",
  "/wiki/Diamond": "Diamond is a solid form of the element carbon with its atoms arranged in a crystal structure called diamond cubic . At room temperature and pressure , another solid form of carbon known as graphite is the chemically stable form , but diamond almost never converts to it . Diamond has the highest hardness and thermal conductivity of any natural material , properties that are utilized in major industrial applications such as cutting and polishing tools . They are also the reason that diamond anvil cells can subject materials to pressures found deep in the Earth . Because the arrangement of atoms in diamond is extremely rigid , few types of impurity can contaminate it ( two exceptions being boron and nitrogen ) . Small numbers of defects or impurities ( about one per million of lattice atoms ) color diamond blue ( boron ) , yellow ( nitrogen ) , brown ( defects ) , green ( radiation exposure ) , purple , pink , orange or red . Diamond also has relatively high optical dispersion ( ability to disperse light of different colors ) . Most natural diamonds have ages between 1 billion and 3.5 billion years . Most were formed at depths between 150 and 250 kilometres ( 93 and 155 mi ) in the Earth 's mantle , although a few have come from as deep as 800 kilometres ( 500 mi ) . Under high pressure and temperature , carbon-containing fluids dissolved minerals and replaced them with diamonds . Much more recently ( tens to hundreds of million years ago ) , they were carried to the surface in volcanic eruptions and deposited in igneous rocks known as kimberlites and lamproites . Synthetic diamonds can be grown from high-purity carbon under high pressures and temperatures or from hydrocarbon gas by chemical vapor deposition ( CVD ) .",

However , certain rocks ( such as lapis lazuli and opal ) and occasionally organic materials that are not minerals ( such as amber , jet , and pearl ) are also used for jewelry and are therefore often considered to be gemstones as well . Most gemstones are hard , but some soft minerals are used in jewelry because of their luster or other physical properties that have aesthetic value . Rarity is another characteristic that lends value to a gemstone . Apart from jewelry , from earliest antiquity engraved gems and hardstone carvings , such as cups , were major luxury art forms .
