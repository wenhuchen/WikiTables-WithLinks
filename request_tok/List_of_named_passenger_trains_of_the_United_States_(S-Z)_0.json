Utica and the nearby city of Rome anchor the Utica-Rome Metropolitan Statistical Area , which comprises all of Oneida and Herkimer counties . Formerly a river settlement inhabited by the Mohawk tribe of the Iroquois Confederacy , Utica attracted European-American settlers from New England during and after the American Revolution . In the 19th century , immigrants strengthened its position as a layover city between Albany and Syracuse on the Erie and Chenango Canals and the New York Central Railroad . During the 19th and 20th centuries , the city 's infrastructure contributed to its success as a manufacturing center and defined its role as a worldwide hub for the textile industry . Utica 's 20th-century political corruption and organized crime gave it the nickname Sin City . Like other Rust Belt cities , Utica underwent an economic downturn beginning in the mid-20th century . The downturn consisted of industrial decline due to globalization and the closure of textile mills , population loss caused by the relocation of jobs and businesses to suburbs and to Syracuse , and poverty associated with socioeconomic stress and a depressed tax base . With its low cost of living , the city has become a melting pot for refugees from war-torn countries around the world , encouraging growth for its colleges and universities , cultural institutions and economy .",

For part of the 20th century , Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment ; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita . Deindustrialization in the 1970s and 80s laid off area blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined , and thousands of downtown white-collar workers also lost jobs when several Pittsburgh-based companies moved out .

  "/wiki/Baltimore_&_Ohio_Railroad": "The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ( reporting marks B & O , BO ) was the first common carrier railroad and the oldest railroad in the United States , with its first section opening in 1830 .

At first the B & O was located entirely in the state of Maryland , its original line extending from the port of Baltimore west to Sandy Hook . Because of competition with the C & O canal for trade with coal fields in western Maryland , it could not use the C & O right of way . Thus , to continue westward while minimizing high-cost track through the Appalachian Mountains , the B & O chose to cross the Potomac River into Virginia ( now West Virginia ) , near the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers . From there track continued through Virginia from Harpers Ferry to a point just west of the junction of Patterson Creek and the North Branch Potomac River , where it crossed back into Maryland to reach Cumberland , the terminus of the National Road . From there the B & O extended to the Ohio River at Wheeling and a few years later also to Parkersburg , West Virginia ( below rapids which made navigation difficult during parts of the year ) . It proved crucial to Union success during the American Civil War , although the conflict also caused considerable damage ( and repair costs ) . After the war 's end , the B & O consolidated several feeder lines in Virginia and West Virginia , as well as expanded westward into Ohio ( including a junction at Portsmouth ) , Indiana and Illinois . B & O advertising later carried the motto : Linking 13 Great States with the Nation . After several mergers , the B & O became part of the CSX Transportation ( CSX ) network .
