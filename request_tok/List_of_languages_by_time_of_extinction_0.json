Its speakers were nomadic hunters who occupied territory in present-day Chile , north of Tierra del Fuego and south of the Mapuche people . It is also known as Aonikenk or Aonekko ' a'ien . The decline of the language started with the occupation of Patagonia by the Chilean and Argentinian states . Tehuelche were considerably influenced by other languages and cultures . This allowed the transference of morpho-syntactical elements into Tehuelche . During the 19th and 20th centuries , Spanish became the dominant language as Argentina and Chile gained independence , and Spanish-speaking settlers took possession of Patagonia . Although the language is not used on a daily basis , it is still a very important symbol for the small group of people who identifies themselves as Tehuelche .",

Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged into the State of Oklahoma when it became the 46th state to enter the union on November 16 , 1907 .

The name Pama-Nyungan is derived from the names of the two most widely separated groups , the Pama languages of the northeast and the Nyungan languages of the southwest . The words pama and nyunga mean man in their respective languages . The other language families indigenous to the continent of Australia are occasionally referred to , by exclusion , as non-Pama-Nyungan languages , though this is not a taxonomic term . The Pama-Nyungan family accounts for most of the geographic spread , most of the Aboriginal population , and the greatest number of languages . Most of the Pama-Nyungan languages are spoken by small ethnic groups of hundreds of speakers or fewer . The vast majority of languages , either due to disease or elimination of their speakers , have become extinct , and almost all remaining ones are endangered in some way . Only in the central inland portions of the continent do Pama-Nyungan languages remain spoken vigorously by the entire community . The Pama-Nyungan family was identified and named by Kenneth L. Hale , in his work on the classification of Native Australian languages . Hale 's research led him to the conclusion that of the Aboriginal Australian languages , one relatively closely interrelated family had spread and proliferated over most of the continent , while approximately a dozen other families were concentrated along the North coast .",

The name Salish or Selisch is the endonym of the Flathead Nation . Linguists later applied the name Salish to related languages in the Pacific Northwest .

All Salishan languages are considered critically endangered , some extremely so , with only three or four speakers left . Those languages considered extinct are often referred to as 'sleeping languages , ' in that no speakers exist currently .

However , by the 1930s the country became increasingly autocratic after the coup in 1934 establishing an authoritarian regime under K\u0101rlis Ulmanis . The country 's de facto independence was interrupted at the outset of World War II , beginning with Latvia 's forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union , followed by the invasion and occupation by Nazi Germany in 1941 , and the re-occupation by the Soviets in 1944 ( Courland Pocket in 1945 ) to form the Latvian SSR for the next 45 years . The peaceful Singing Revolution , starting in 1987 , called for Baltic emancipation from Soviet rule and condemning the Communist regime 's illegal takeover .

Some ethnic Livonians are learning or have learned Livonian in an attempt to revive it , but because ethnic Livonians are a small minority , opportunities to use Livonian are limited . The Estonian newspaper Eesti P\u00e4evaleht erroneously announced that Viktors Bertholds , who died on 28 February 2009 , was the last native speaker who started the Latvian-language school as a monolingual . Some other Livonians had argued , however , that there were some native speakers left , including Viktors Bertholds ' cousin , Grizelda Kristi\u0146a . Kristi\u0146a died in 2013 . An article published by the Foundation for Endangered Languages in 2007 stated that there were only 182 registered Livonians and a mere six native speakers . In a 2009 conference proceeding , it was mentioned that there could be at best 10 living native speakers of the language . The promotion of the Livonian language as a living language has been advanced mostly by the Livonian Cultural Centre ( L\u012bv\u00f5 Kult\u016br Sid\u0101m ) , an organisation of mostly young Livonians . Livonian as a lesser used language in Latvia - along with Latgalian - is represented by the Latvian Bureau of Lesser Used Languages ( LatBLUL ) , formerly a national branch of the European Bureau of Lesser Used Languages ( EBLUL ) .",

Thompson was the oldest living Yurok and the last known native-born , active speaker of the Yurok language at the time of his death in 2013 . He was the last of about twenty Yurok elders who worked to revitalize the Yurok language . He worked with academics and linguists to preserve and revitalize the language among younger Yurok generations throughout the 1990s and 2000s . Those same linguists had originally predicted that Yurok would be extinct by 2010 and Thompson received much of the credit for saving the language . Yurok is now taught in five high schools throughout Humboldt and Del Norte counties in northern California . While the language is still endangered , the effort to preserve Yurok is considered to be the most successful revitalization effort in California .",

The Scots language developed during the Middle English period as a distinct entity . Scots is recognised as an indigenous language of Scotland , a regional or minority language of Europe , and as a vulnerable language by UNESCO . As there are no universally accepted criteria for distinguishing a language from a dialect , scholars and other interested parties often disagree about the linguistic , historical and social status of Scots and particularly its relationship to English . Although a number of paradigms for distinguishing between languages and dialects exist , they often render contradictory results . Broad Scots is at one end of a bipolar linguistic continuum , with Scottish Standard English at the other . Scots is often regarded as one of the ancient varieties of English , but it has its own distinct dialects . Alternatively , Scots is sometimes treated as a distinct Germanic language , in the way that Norwegian is closely linked to but distinct from Danish .

  "/wiki/Creole_language": "A creole language , or simply creole , is a stable natural language that develops from the simplifying and mixing of different languages into a new one within a fairly brief period of time : often , a pidgin evolved into a full-fledged language . While the concept is similar to that of a mixed or hybrid language , creoles are often characterized by a tendency to systematize their inherited grammar ( e.g. , by eliminating irregularities or regularizing the conjugation of otherwise irregular verbs ) . Like any language , creoles are characterized by a consistent system of grammar , possess large stable vocabularies , and are acquired by children as their native language . These three features distinguish a creole language from a pidgin . Creolistics , or creology , is the study of creole languages and , as such , is a subfield of linguistics . Someone who engages in this study is called a creolist . The precise number of creole languages is not known , particularly as many are poorly attested or documented . About one hundred creole languages have arisen since 1500 . These are predominantly based on European languages such as English and French due to the European Age of Discovery and the Atlantic slave trade that arose at that time . With the improvements in ship-building and navigation , traders had to learn to communicate with people around the world , and the quickest way to do this was to develop a pidgin , or simplified language suited to the purpose ; in turn , full creole languages developed from these pidgins . In addition to creoles that have European languages as their base , there are , for example , creoles based on Arabic , Chinese , and Malay . The creole with the largest number of speakers is Haitian Creole , with almost ten million native speakers , followed by Tok Pisin with about 4 million , most of whom are second-language speakers .",
