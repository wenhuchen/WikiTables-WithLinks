One dollar is divided into 100 cents ( Symbol : \u00a2 ) or 1000 mills ( for accounting purposes and for taxing . Symbol : \u20a5 ) . The Coinage Act of 1792 created a decimal currency by creating the following coins : tenth dollar , one-twentieth dollar , one-hundredth dollar . In addition the act created the dollar , half dollar , and quarter dollar coins . All of these coins are still minted in 2020 . In addition , several forms of paper money were introduced by Congress over the years . The latest of these , the Federal Reserve Note , was authorized by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , while all existing U.S. currency remains legal tender . Issuance of the previous form of the currency ( U.S. notes ) was discontinued in January 1971 . As a result , currently circulating paper money consists primarily of Federal Reserve Notes that are denominated in United States dollars ( 12 U.S.C . \u00a7 418 ) . Since the suspension in 1971 of convertibility of paper U.S. currency into any precious metal , the U.S. dollar is de facto fiat money .",

  "/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit": "An application-specific integrated circuit ( ASIC /\u02c8e\u026as\u026ak/ ) is an integrated circuit ( IC ) chip customized for a particular use , rather than intended for general-purpose use . For example , a chip designed to run in a digital voice recorder or a high-efficiency bitcoin miner is an ASIC . Application-specific standard product ( ASSP ) chips are intermediate between ASICs and industry standard integrated circuits like the 7400 series or the 4000 series . ASIC chips are typically fabricated using metal-oxide-semiconductor ( MOS ) technology , as MOS integrated circuit chips . As feature sizes have shrunk and design tools improved over the years , the maximum complexity ( and hence functionality ) possible in an ASIC has grown from 5,000 logic gates to over 100 million . Modern ASICs often include entire microprocessors , memory blocks including ROM , RAM , EEPROM , flash memory and other large building blocks . Such an ASIC is often termed a SoC ( system-on-chip ) . Designers of digital ASICs often use a hardware description language ( HDL ) , such as Verilog or VHDL , to describe the functionality of ASICs . Field-programmable gate arrays ( FPGA ) are the modern-day technology for building a breadboard or prototype from standard parts ; programmable logic blocks and programmable interconnects allow the same FPGA to be used in many different applications . For smaller designs or lower production volumes , FPGAs may be more cost effective than an ASIC design , even in production . The non-recurring engineering ( NRE ) cost of an ASIC can run into the millions of dollars . Therefore , device manufacturers typically prefer FPGAs for prototyping and devices with low production volume and ASICs for very large production volumes where NRE costs can be amortized across many devices .",

Data transmission between nodes is supported over data links consisting of physical cable media , such as twisted pair or fibre-optic cables , or by wireless methods , such as Wi-Fi , microwave transmission , or free-space optical communication . Network nodes are network computer devices that originate , route and terminate data communication . They are generally identified by network addresses , and can include hosts such as personal computers , phones , and servers , as well as networking hardware such as routers and switches . Two such devices can be said to be networked when one device is able to exchange information with the other device , whether or not they have a direct connection to each other . In most cases , application-specific communications protocols are layered ( i.e . carried as payload ) over other more general communications protocols . Computer networks support many applications and services , such as access to the World Wide Web , digital video , digital audio , shared use of application and storage servers , printers , and fax machines , and use of email and instant messaging applications .

Data sent through the internet , such as a web page or email , is in the form of data packets . A packet is typically forwarded from one router to another router through the networks that constitute an internetwork ( e.g . the Internet ) until it reaches its destination node . A router is connected to two or more data lines from different IP networks . [ b ] When a data packet comes in on one of the lines , the router reads the network address information in the packet header to determine the ultimate destination . Then , using information in its routing table or routing policy , it directs the packet to the next network on its journey . The most familiar type of IP routers are home and small office routers that simply forward IP packets between the home computers and the Internet . An example of a router would be the owner 's cable or DSL router , which connects to the Internet through an Internet service provider ( ISP ) .

  "/wiki/VoIP": "Voice over Internet Protocol ( VoIP ) , also called IP telephony , is a method and group of technologies for the delivery of voice communications and multimedia sessions over Internet Protocol ( IP ) networks , such as the Internet . The terms Internet telephony , broadband telephony , and broadband phone service specifically refer to the provisioning of communications services ( voice , fax , SMS , voice-messaging ) over the public Internet , rather than via the public switched telephone network ( PSTN ) , also known as plain old telephone service ( POTS ) . The steps and principles involved in originating VoIP telephone calls are similar to traditional digital telephony and involve signaling , channel setup , digitization of the analog voice signals , and encoding . Instead of being transmitted over a circuit-switched network , the digital information is packetized and transmission occurs as IP packets over a packet-switched network . They transport media streams using special media delivery protocols that encode audio and video with audio codecs and video codecs . Various codecs exist that optimize the media stream based on application requirements and network bandwidth ; some implementations rely on narrowband and compressed speech , while others support high-fidelity stereo codecs . The most widely speech coding standards in VoIP are based on the linear predictive coding ( LPC ) and modified discrete cosine transform ( MDCT ) compression methods . Popular codecs include the MDCT-based AAC-LD ( used in FaceTime ) , the LPC/MDCT-based Opus ( used in WhatsApp ) , the LPC-based SILK ( used in Skype ) , \u03bc-law and A-law versions of G.711 , G.722 , and an open source voice codec known as iLBC , a codec that uses only 8 kbit/s each way called G.729 . Early providers of voice-over-IP services offered business models and technical solutions that mirrored the architecture of the legacy telephone network . Second-generation providers , such as Skype , built closed networks for private user bases , offering the benefit of free calls and convenience while potentially charging for access to other communication networks , such as the PSTN . This limited the freedom of users to mix-and-match third-party hardware and software . Third-generation providers , such as Google Talk , adopted the concept of federated VoIP - which is a departure from the architecture of the legacy networks .",

  "/wiki/Software-defined_network": "Software-defined networking ( SDN ) technology is an approach to network management that enables dynamic , programmatically efficient network configuration in order to improve network performance and monitoring making it more like cloud computing than traditional network management . SDN is meant to address the fact that the static architecture of traditional networks is decentralized and complex while current networks require more flexibility and easy troubleshooting . SDN attempts to centralize network intelligence in one network component by disassociating the forwarding process of network packets ( data plane ) from the routing process ( control plane ) . The control plane consists of one or more controllers which are considered as the brain of SDN network where the whole intelligence is incorporated . However , the intelligent centralization has its own drawbacks when it comes to security , scalability and elasticity and this is the main issue of SDN . SDN was commonly associated with the OpenFlow protocol ( for remote communication with network plane elements for the purpose of determining the path of network packets across network switches ) since the latter 's emergence in 2011 . However , since 2012 OpenFlow for many companies is no longer an exclusive solution , they added proprietary techniques . These include Cisco Systems ' Open Network Environment and Nicira 's network virtualization platform . SD-WAN applies similar technology to a wide area network ( WAN ) . SDN technology is currently available for industrial control applications that require extremely fast failover . One company boasts 100x Faster Failover for Mission-critical processes ( fails over in less than 100 \u03bcs , compared to 10 ms for traditional networks ) along with the elimination of certain Cyber Vulnerabilities that are associated with traditional network management switches .

  "/wiki/Piscataway,_New_Jersey": "Piscataway ( /p\u026a\u02c8sk\u00e6t\u0259we\u026a/ ) is a township in Middlesex County , New Jersey , United States . As of the 2010 United States Census , the township 's population was 56,044 , reflecting an increase of 5,562 ( +11.0% ) from the 50,482 counted in the 2000 Census , which had in turn increased by 3,393 ( +7.2% ) from the 47,089 counted in 1990 . The name Piscataway may be derived from the area 's original Native American residents , transplants from near the Piscataqua River defining the coastal border between New Hampshire and Maine , whose name derives from peske ( branch ) and tegwe ( tidal river ) , or alternatively from pisgeu ( meaning dark night ) and awa ( place of ) or from a Lenape language word meaning great deer or from words meaning place of dark night . The area was appropriated in 1666 by Quakers and Baptists who had left the Puritan colony in New Hampshire . Piscataway Township was formed on December 18 , 1666 , and officially incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21 , 1798 , as part of the state 's initial group of 104 townships . The community , the fifth-oldest municipality in New Jersey , has grown from Native American territory , through a colonial period and is one of the links in the earliest settlement of the Atlantic Ocean seacoast that ultimately led to the formation of the United States . Over the years , portions of Piscataway were taken to form Raritan Township ( March 17 , 1870 , now Edison ) , Dunellen ( October 28 , 1887 ) , Middlesex ( April 9 , 1913 ) and South Plainfield ( March 10 , 1926 ) . Piscataway has advanced educational and research facilities due to the presence of Rutgers University , whose main campus spills into the township . SHI Stadium , home field for the Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team , is in Piscataway . Part of the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School is located in Piscataway as well . In 2008 , Money magazine ranked Piscataway 23rd out of the top 100 places to live in America . In 2014 , the magazine ranked Piscataway 27th out of top 50 places to live in America ."
