  "/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II": "The bombing of Dresden was a British/American aerial bombing attack on the city of Dresden , the capital of the German state of Saxony , during World War II . In four raids between 13 and 15 February 1945 , 722 heavy bombers of the British Royal Air Force ( RAF ) and 527 of the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) dropped more than 3,900 tons of high-explosive bombs and incendiary devices on the city . The bombing and the resulting firestorm destroyed more than 1,600 acres ( 6.5 km2 ) of the city centre . An estimated 22,700 to 25,000 people were killed , [ a ] although larger casualty figures have been claimed . Three more USAAF air raids followed , two occurring on 2 March aimed at the city 's railway marshalling yard and one smaller raid on 17 April aimed at industrial areas . Immediate German propaganda claims following the attacks and postwar discussions of whether the attacks were justified have led to the bombing becoming one of the moral causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres of the war . A 1953 United States Air Force report defended the operation as the justified bombing of a strategic target , which they noted was a major rail transport and communication centre , housing 110 factories and 50,000 workers in support of the German war effort . Several researchers claim that not all of the communications infrastructure , such as the bridges , were targeted , nor were extensive industrial areas outside the city center . Critics of the bombing have asserted that Dresden was a cultural landmark while downplaying its strategic significance , and claim that the attacks were indiscriminate area bombing and not proportionate to the military gains . Although not supported by any legal standard , as Dresden was both defended and constituted a major military transportation hub , and housed many war industries , some have claimed that the raid constituted a war crime . Some , mostly in the German far-right , refer to the bombing as a mass murder , calling it Dresden 's Holocaust of bombs . Large variations in the claimed death toll have fuelled the controversy .",

  "/wiki/Zombie": "A zombie ( Haitian French : zombi , Haitian Creole : zonbi ) is a fictional undead being created through the reanimation of a corpse . Zombies are most commonly found in horror and fantasy genre works . The term comes from Haitian folklore , in which a zombie is a dead body reanimated through various methods , most commonly magic . Modern depictions of the reanimation of the dead do not necessarily involve magic but often invoke science fictional methods such as carriers , radiation , mental diseases , vectors , pathogens , parasites , scientific accidents , etc . The English word zombie was first recorded in 1819 , in a history of Brazil by the poet Robert Southey , in the form of zombi . The Oxford English Dictionary gives the word 's origin as West African and compares it to the Kongo words nzambi ( god ) and zumbi ( fetish ) . A Kimbundu-to-Portuguese dictionary from 1903 defines the related word nzumbi as soul , while a later Kimbundu-Portuguese dictionary defines it as being a spirit that is supposed to wander the earth to torment the living . One of the first books to expose Western culture to the concept of the voodoo zombie was The Magic Island ( 1929 ) by W. B. Seabrook . This is the sensationalized account of a narrator who encounters voodoo cults in Haiti and their resurrected thralls . Time commented that the book introduced 'zombi ' into U.S. speech . Zombies have a complex literary heritage , with antecedents ranging from Richard Matheson and H. P. Lovecraft to Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein drawing on European folklore of the undead .

  "/wiki/Paraguay": "Paraguay ( /\u02c8p\u00e6r\u0259\u0261wa\u026a/ ; Spanish pronunciation : [ pa\u027ea\u02c8\u0263waj ] ( listen ) ; Guarani : Paragu\u00e1i , [ pa\u027ea\u02c8\u0270waj ] ) , officially the Republic of Paraguay ( Spanish : Rep\u00fablica del Paraguay ; Guarani : Tet\u00e3 Paragu\u00e1i ) , is a country in South America . It is bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest , Brazil to the east and northeast , and Bolivia to the northwest . Although it is one of only two landlocked countries in South America ( the other is Bolivia ) , the country has coasts , beaches and ports on the Paraguay and Paran\u00e1 rivers that give exit to the Atlantic Ocean through the Paran\u00e1-Paraguay Waterway . Due to its central location in South America , it is sometimes referred to as Coraz\u00f3n de Sudam\u00e9rica ( Heart of South America ) . Spanish conquistadores arrived in 1524 after navigating northwards from the R\u00edo de la Plata to the Paran\u00e1 River , and finally up the Paraguay River . In 1537 , they established the city of Asunci\u00f3n , which was the first capital of the Governorate of Paraguay and R\u00edo de la Plata . Paraguay was the epicenter of the Jesuit Missions , where the Guaran\u00ed people were educated and introduced to Christianity and European culture under the direction of the Society of Jesus in Jesuit reductions , mainly during the 17th century . However , after the expulsion of the Jesuits from Spanish territories in 1767 , Paraguay increasingly became a peripheral colony , with few urban centers and settlers . Following independence from Spain at the beginning of the 19th century , Paraguay was ruled by a series of authoritarian governments who generally implemented nationalist , isolationist and protectionist policies . This period ended with the disastrous Paraguayan War , during which Paraguay lost at least 50% of its prewar population and around 25-33% of its territory to the Triple Alliance of Argentina , Brazil and Uruguay . In the 20th century , Paraguay faced another major international conflict - the Chaco War - against Bolivia , from which the Paraguayans emerged victorious . Afterwards , the country entered a period of military dictatorships , ending with the 35 year regime of Alfredo Stroessner that lasted until he was toppled in 1989 by an internal military coup .",

  "/wiki/Nimitz_class_aircraft_carrier": "The Nimitz class is a class of ten nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in service with the United States Navy . The lead ship of the class is named after World War II United States Pacific Fleet commander Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz , who was the second-to-last living U.S. Navy officer to hold the rank , preceding William Halsey Jr. With an overall length of 1,092 ft ( 333 m ) and full-load displacement of over 100,000 long tons ( 100,000 t ) , the Nimitz-class ships were the largest warships built and in service until USS Gerald R. Ford entered the fleet in 2017 . Instead of the gas turbines or diesel-electric systems used for propulsion on many modern warships , the carriers use two A4W pressurized water reactors which drive four propeller shafts and can produce a maximum speed of over 30 knots ( 56 km/h ) and maximum power of around 260,000 shaft horsepower ( 190 MW ) . As a result of the use of nuclear power , the ships are capable of operating for over 20 years without refueling and are predicted to have a service life of over 50 years . They are categorized as nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and are numbered with consecutive hull numbers between CVN-68 and CVN-77 . [ Note 1 ] All ten carriers were constructed by Newport News Shipbuilding Company in Virginia . USS Nimitz , the lead ship of the class , was commissioned on 3 May 1975 , and USS George H.W . Bush , the tenth and last of the class , was commissioned on 10 January 2009 . Since the 1970s , Nimitz-class carriers have participated in many conflicts and operations across the world , including Operation Eagle Claw in Iran , the Gulf War , and more recently in Iraq and Afghanistan . The angled flight decks of the carriers use a CATOBAR arrangement to operate aircraft , with steam catapults and arrestor wires for launch and recovery . As well as speeding up flight deck operations , this allows for a much wider variety of aircraft than with the STOVL arrangement used on smaller carriers . An embarked carrier air wing consisting of up to around 90 aircraft is normally deployed on board .",

New Zealand , the Netherlands ( mainly the Dutch East Indies ) , the Philippines , United Kingdom , and other Allied nations also contributed forces . The South Pacific became a major theatre of the war following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 . Initially , US war plans called for a counteroffensive across the Central Pacific , but this was disrupted by the loss of battleships at Pearl Harbor . During the First South Pacific Campaign , US forces sought to establish a defensive perimeter against additional Japanese attacks . This was followed by the Second South Pacific Campaign , which began with the Battle of Guadalcanal ."
