  "/wiki/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom": "George IV ( George Augustus Frederick ; 12 August 1762 - 26 June 1830 ) was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and King of Hanover following the death of his father , King George III , on 29 January 1820 , until his own death ten years later . From 1811 until his accession , he served as regent during his father 's final mental illness . George IV was the eldest child of King George III and Queen Charlotte . He led an extravagant lifestyle that contributed to the fashions of the Regency era . He was a patron of new forms of leisure , style and taste . He commissioned John Nash to build the Royal Pavilion in Brighton and remodel Buckingham Palace , and Sir Jeffry Wyatville to rebuild Windsor Castle . George 's charm and culture earned him the title the first gentleman of England , but his dissolute way of life and poor relationships with his parents and his wife , Caroline of Brunswick , earned him the contempt of the people and dimmed the prestige of the monarchy . He excluded Caroline from the coronation and asked the government to introduce the unpopular Pains and Penalties Bill in an unsuccessful attempt to divorce her . George 's ministers found his behaviour selfish , unreliable and irresponsible . At all times he was much under the influence of favourites . He did not provide national leadership in time of crisis , nor act as a role model for his people . Taxpayers were angry at his wasteful spending during the Napoleonic Wars .",

She was the Princess of Wales from 1795 to 1820 . The daughter of Charles William Ferdinand , Duke of Brunswick , and Princess Augusta of Great Britain , Caroline was engaged to her first cousin , George , in 1794 despite the two of them never having met . He was already illegally married to Maria Fitzherbert . George and Caroline married the following year but separated shortly after the birth of their only child , Princess Charlotte of Wales , in 1796 . By 1806 , rumours that Caroline had taken lovers and had an illegitimate child led to an investigation into her private life . The dignitaries who led the investigation concluded that there was no foundation to the rumours , but Caroline 's access to her daughter was nonetheless restricted . In 1814 , Caroline moved to Italy , where she employed Bartolomeo Pergami as a servant . Pergami soon became Caroline 's closest companion , and it was widely assumed that they were lovers . In 1817 , Caroline was devastated when Charlotte died in childbirth . She heard the news from a passing courier as George had refused to write and tell her . He was determined to divorce Caroline , and set up a second investigation to collect evidence of her adultery .",

His reign saw several reforms : the poor law was updated , child labour restricted , slavery abolished in nearly all of the British Empire , and the British electoral system refashioned by the Reform Act 1832 . Although William did not engage in politics as much as his brother or his father , he was the last monarch to appoint a British prime minister contrary to the will of Parliament . He granted his German kingdom a short-lived liberal constitution .

He was the Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Witney from 2001 to 2016 and leader of the Conservative Party from 2005 to 2016 . He identifies as a one-nation conservative , and has been associated with both economically liberal and socially liberal policies .

From 1988 to 1993 he worked at the Conservative Research Department , latterly assisting the Conservative Prime Minister John Major , before leaving politics to work for Carlton Communications in 1994 . Becoming an MP in 2001 , he served in the opposition shadow cabinet under Conservative leader Michael Howard , and succeeded Howard in 2005 . Cameron sought to rebrand the Conservatives , embracing an increasingly socially liberal position . The 2010 general election led to Cameron becoming Prime Minister as the head of a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats - the youngest holder of the office since the 1810s . His premiership was marked by the ongoing effects of the late-2000s financial crisis ; these involved a large deficit in government finances that his government sought to reduce through austerity measures . His administration introduced large-scale changes to welfare , immigration policy , education , and healthcare . It privatised the Royal Mail and some other state assets , and legalised same-sex marriage in England and Wales . Internationally , his government intervened militarily in the Libyan Civil War and later authorised the bombing of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ; domestically , his government oversaw the referendum on voting reform and Scottish independence referendum , both of which confirmed Cameron 's favoured outcome .",

Although the accession of the young monarch was initially regarded auspiciously , his reign soon became controversial : Constantine 's involvement in the Apostasia of July 1965 created unrest among sections of the population and aggravated the ongoing political instability that culminated in the Colonels ' Coup of 21 April 1967 .

Though he disliked the idea of matrimony for his daughters , King George had intended to find them suitable husbands when they came of age . However , the King 's recurring bouts of madness , as well as the Queen 's desire to have her daughters live their lives as her companions , stopped would-be suitors from offering for most of the princesses . As a result , Sophia and all but one of her sisters grew up in their mother 's cloistered household , which they frequently referred to as a Nunnery . Though she never wed , rumours spread that Sophia became pregnant by Thomas Garth , an equerry of her father 's , and gave birth to an illegitimate son in the summer of 1800 . Other gossip declared the child was the product of rape by her elder brother the Duke of Cumberland , who was deeply unpopular . Historians are divided on the validity of these stories , as some believe she gave birth to Garth 's child while others call them tales spread by the Royal Family 's political enemies . The efforts of the Prince Regent to gain his sisters increased independence were further hastened along with Queen Charlotte 's death in 1818 .
