  "/wiki/Porsche_928": "The Porsche 928 is a luxury grand tourer produced by Porsche AG of Germany from 1978 to 1995 . Originally intended to replace the company 's iconic 911 , the 928 combined the power , poise , and handling of a sports car with the refinement , comfort , and equipment of a luxury sedan . Porsche executives believed such a flagship would have wider appeal than the compact , quirky and sometimes difficult to drive 911 . The 928 has the distinction of being the company 's first production V8 powered model and its only coup\u00e9 powered by a front-mounted V8 engine .",

Launched as the Nuova ( new ) 500 in July 1957 , as a successor to the 500 Topolino , it was an inexpensive and practical small car . Measuring 2.97 metres ( 9 feet 9 inches ) long , and originally powered by a 479 cc two-cylinder , air-cooled engine , the 500 was 24.5 centimetres ( 9.6 inches ) smaller than Fiat 's 600 , launched two years earlier , and is considered one of the first purpose-designed city cars . In 2007 , the 50th anniversary of the Nuova 500 's launch , Fiat launched another new 500 , stylistically inspired by the 1957 Nuova 500 , featuring a front-mounted engine and front-wheel drive . In 2017 Fiat celebrated the 60th anniversary with an exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and received one of the Corporate Art Awards by pptArt at an event hosted by the President of the Italian Republic Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinal Palace .",

  "/wiki/Volkswagen_Type_2": "The Volkswagen Type 2 , known officially ( depending on body type ) as the Transporter , Kombi or Microbus , or , informally , as the Bus ( US ) or Camper ( UK ) , P\u00e3o de Forma ( Loaf of Bread ) ( Portugal ) is a forward control light commercial vehicle introduced in 1950 by the German automaker Volkswagen as its second car model . Following - and initially deriving from - Volkswagen 's first model , the Type 1 ( Beetle ) , it was given the factory designation Type 2 . As one of the forerunners of the modern cargo and passenger vans , the Type 2 gave rise to forward control competitors in the United States in the 1960s , including the Ford Econoline , the Dodge A100 , and the Chevrolet Corvair 95 Corvan , the latter adapting the rear-engine configuration of the Corvair car in the same manner in which the VW Type 2 adapted the Type 1 layout . European competition included the 1947-1981 Citro\u00ebn H Van , the 1959-1980 Renault Estafette ( both FF layout ) , and the 1953-1965 FR layout Ford Transit . Japanese manufacturers also introduced similar vehicles , such as the Nissan Caravan , Toyota LiteAce and Subaru Sambar . Like the Beetle , the van has received numerous nicknames worldwide , including the microbus , minibus , and , because of its popularity during the counterculture movement of the 1960s , Hippie van/bus has become its most popular . Brazil contained the last factory in the world that produced the T2 series of Type 2 , which ceased production on 31 December 2013 , due to the introduction of more stringent safety regulations in the country . This ( after the 2002 termination of its T3 successor in South Africa ) marked the end of the era of rear-engine Volkswagens , which originated in 1935 with their Type 1 prototypes .",
  "/wiki/Sodablasting": "Sodablasting is a mild form of abrasive blasting in which sodium bicarbonate particles are blasted against a surface using compressed air . It has a much milder abrasive effect than sandblasting . An early use was in the conservation-restoration of the Statue of Liberty in the 1980s . Sodablasting is a non-destructive method for many applications in cleaning , paint and varnish stripping , automotive restoration , industrial equipment maintenance , rust removal , graffiti removal , molecular steel passivation against rust , oil removal by saponification and translocation , masonry cleaning and restoration , soot remediation , boat hull cleaning and for food processing facilities and equipment and tooth cleaning at the dental laboratory .",
  "/wiki/DMC_DeLorean": "The DMC DeLorean ( often referred to simply as the DeLorean , as it was the only model ever produced by the company ) is a sports car manufactured by John DeLorean 's DeLorean Motor Company ( DMC ) for the American market from 1981 through 1983 . The car was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro and stood out for its gull-wing doors and brushed stainless-steel outer body panels , as well as an innovative fiberglass body structure with a steel backbone chassis . It became widely known for its disappointing lack of power and performance , which did not match the expectations created by its looks and price tag , but it became iconic for its appearances as the time machine in the Back to the Future media franchise after 1985 . Throughout production , the car was generally unchanged , although minor modifications were made to such parts as the hood and wheels . The first production car was completed on January 21 , 1981 . About 9,000 DeLoreans were made before production halted in late December 1982 . In 2007 , about 6,500 DeLorean cars were thought to still exist . In 1995 , Stephen Wynne from Liverpool created a separate company based in Texas using the DeLorean Motor Company name . Wynne acquired the trademark on the stylized DMC logo , along with the remaining parts inventory of the original DeLorean Motor Company . The company rebuilds cars at its Humble , Texas , location using a combination of new old stock ( NOS ) parts , original equipment manufacturer ( OEM ) , and reproduction parts on a made-to-order basis .",

  "/wiki/Volkswagen_Beetle": "The Volkswagen Beetle - officially the Volkswagen Type 1 , informally in German the K\u00e4fer ( meaning beetle ) , in parts of the English-speaking world the Bug , and known by many other nicknames in other languages - is a two-door , rear-engine economy car , intended for five occupants ( later , Beetles were restricted to four people in some countries ) , that was manufactured and marketed by German automaker Volkswagen ( VW ) from 1938 until 2003 . The need for a people 's car ( Volkswagen in German ) , its concept and its functional objectives were formulated by the leader of Nazi Germany , Adolf Hitler , who wanted a cheap , simple car to be mass-produced for his country 's new road network ( Reichsautobahn ) . Members of the National Socialist party , with an additional dues surcharge , were promised the first production , but the war shifted production to military vehicles instead . Lead engineer Ferdinand Porsche and his team took until 1938 to finalise the design . B\u00e9la Bar\u00e9nyi is credited with first conceiving the original design for this car in 1925 , - notably by Mercedes-Benz , on their website , including his original technical drawing , - five years before Porsche claimed to have done his initial version . The influence on Porsche 's design of other contemporary cars , such as the Tatra V570 , and the work of Josef Ganz remains a subject of dispute . The result was the first Volkswagen , and one of the first rear-engined cars since the Brass Era . With 21,529,464 produced , the Beetle is the longest-running and most-manufactured car of a single platform ever made . Although designed in the 1930s , due to World War II , civilian Beetles only began to be produced in significant numbers by the end of the 1940s . The car was then internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1 , and marketed simply as the Volkswagen . Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200 , 1300 , 1500 , 1302 , or 1303 , the former three indicating engine displacement , the latter two derived from the model number . The car became widely known in its home country as the K\u00e4fer ( German for beetle , cognate with English chafer ) and was later marketed under that name in Germany , and as the Volkswagen in other countries .",
  "/wiki/Subaru_Impreza": "The Subaru Impreza ( Japanese : \u30b9\u30d0\u30eb\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30d7\u30ec\u30c3\u30b5 , Subaru Inpuressa ) is a compact car that has been manufactured since 1992 by Subaru , introduced as a replacement for the Leone , with the predecessor 's EA series engines replaced by the new EJ series . Now in its fifth generation , Subaru has offered four-door sedan and five-door body variants since 1992 ; the firm also offered a coupe from 1995 until 2001 , and a 5-door wagon from the Impreza 's introduction in the form of a hatchback . Mainstream versions have received boxer flat-four engines ranging from 1.5- to 2.5-liters , with the performance-oriented Impreza WRX and WRX STI models uprated with the addition of turbochargers . Since the third generation series , some markets have adopted the abbreviated Subaru WRX name for these high-performance variants . The first three generations of Impreza in North America were also available with an off-road appearance package called the Outback Sport . For the fourth generation , this appearance package was renamed the XV ( Crosstrek in North America ) , and , unlike the Outback Sport ( which was exclusive to the North American market ) , is sold internationally . Colloquially , the car is sometimes referred to as Scooby . The Impreza ( also Impreza WRX and Impreza WRX STI ) was a major rival to the Mitsubishi Lancer ( and Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution ) . Subaru has offered both front- and all-wheel drive layouts for the Impreza . Since the late-1990s , some markets have restricted sales to the all-wheel drive model - therefore granting the Impreza a unique selling proposition in the global compact class characterized by front-wheel drive . However , Japanese models remain available in either configuration . A 2019 iSeeCars study named the Impreza as the lowest-depreciating sedan after five years .",
