  "/wiki/Geographic_Names_Information_System": "The Geographic Names Information System ( GNIS ) is a database that contains name and locative information about more than two million physical and cultural features located throughout the United States of America and its territories . It is a type of gazetteer . GNIS was developed by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the United States Board on Geographic Names ( BGN ) to promote the standardization of feature names . The database is part of a system that includes topographic map names and bibliographic references . The names of books and historic maps that confirm the feature or place name are cited . Variant names , alternatives to official federal names for a feature , are also recorded . Each feature receives a permanent , unique feature record identifier , sometimes called the GNIS identifier . The database never removes an entry , except in cases of obvious duplication .",
  "/wiki/Hyperlink": "In computing , a hyperlink , or simply a link , is a reference to data that the user can follow by clicking or tapping . A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document . Hypertext is text with hyperlinks . The text that is linked from is called anchor text . A software system that is used for viewing and creating hypertext is a hypertext system , and to create a hyperlink is to hyperlink ( or simply to link ) . A user following hyperlinks is said to navigate or browse the hypertext . The document containing a hyperlink is known as its source document . For example , in an online reference work such as Wikipedia , or Google , many words and terms in the text are hyperlinked to definitions of those terms . Hyperlinks are often used to implement reference mechanisms such as tables of contents , footnotes , bibliographies , indexes , letters and glossaries . In some hypertext , hyperlinks can be bidirectional : they can be followed in two directions , so both ends act as anchors and as targets . More complex arrangements exist , such as many-to-many links . The effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system and may sometimes depend on the link itself ; for instance , on the World Wide Web most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the document being displayed , but some are marked to cause the target document to open in a new window .",
  "/wiki/Elevation": "The elevation of a geographic location is its height above or below a fixed reference point , most commonly a reference geoid , a mathematical model of the Earth 's sea level as an equipotential gravitational surface ( see Geodetic datum \u00a7 Vertical datum ) . The term elevation is mainly used when referring to points on the Earth 's surface , while altitude or geopotential height is used for points above the surface , such as an aircraft in flight or a spacecraft in orbit , and depth is used for points below the surface . Elevation is not to be confused with the distance from the center of the Earth . Due to the equatorial bulge , the summits of Mount Everest and Chimborazo have , respectively , the largest elevation and the largest geocentric distance .",
  "/wiki/Municipality": "A municipality is usually a single administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and regional laws to which it is subordinate . It is to be distinguished ( usually ) from the county , which may encompass rural territory or numerous small communities such as towns , villages and hamlets . The term municipality may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality . A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision , as opposed to a special-purpose district . The term is derived from French municipalit\u00e9 and Latin municipalis . The English word municipality derives from the Latin social contract municipium ( derived from a word meaning duty holders ) , referring to the Latin communities that supplied Rome with troops in exchange for their own incorporation into the Roman state ( granting Roman citizenship to the inhabitants ) while permitting the communities to retain their own local governments ( a limited autonomy ) . A municipality can be any political jurisdiction from a sovereign state , such as the Principality of Monaco , to a small village , such as West Hampton Dunes , New York . The territory over which a municipality has jurisdiction may encompass",
  "/wiki/List_of_boroughs_and_census_areas_in_Alaska": "The U.S. state of Alaska is divided into 19 organized boroughs and one Unorganized Borough . Alaska and Louisiana are the only states that do not call their first-order administrative subdivisions counties ( Louisiana uses parishes instead ) . Many of the most densely populated regions of the state are part of Alaska 's boroughs , which function similarly to counties in other states . However , unlike county equivalents in the other 49 states , the organized boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state . There are four different classes of organized boroughs : Unified Home Rule ( may exercise all legislative powers not prohibited by law or charter ) ; Non-unified Home Rule ; First Class ( may exercise any power not prohibited by law on non-area wide basis by adopting ordinances ) ; and Second Class ( must gain voter approval for authority to exercise many non-area wide powers ) . The area not part of any organized borough is referred to as the Unorganized Borough . The U.S. Census Bureau , in cooperation with the state , divides the Unorganized Borough into 10 census areas , each roughly corresponding to an election district , thus totaling 29 county equivalents . However , these areas exist solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation ; they have no government of their own . Boroughs and census areas are both treated as county-level equivalents by the Census Bureau . Some areas in the unorganized borough receive limited public services directly from the Alaska state government , usually law enforcement from the Alaska State Troopers and educational funding . Six consolidated city-borough governments exist - Juneau City and Borough , Skagway Municipality , Sitka City and Borough , Yakutat City and Borough , Wrangell City and Borough , as well as the state 's largest city , Anchorage . Though its legal name is the Municipality of Anchorage , it is considered a consolidated city-borough under state law .",
  "/wiki/Anchorage_Memorial_Park": "The Anchorage Memorial Park , also known as Anchorage Cemetery , is a 22-acre ( 89,000 m2 ) cemetery located in Anchorage , Alaska , USA . Covering nine city blocks , the cemetery separates the city 's downtown and Fairview neighborhoods . The cemetery was established by President Woodrow Wilson in 1915 as part of the Anchorage townsite , one of a number of land reserves set aside for public facilities for the new town . It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993 , recognizing its status as Anchorage 's oldest cemetery . From approximately 1954 to 1986 , a public housing complex called Willow Park occupied the half-blocks of the cemetery site adjacent to Ninth Avenue and Fairbanks Street . The buildings were razed to allow for expansion of the cemetery . All that remains is the complex 's maintenance building , taken over for the same purpose by the cemetery .",

Due to its location , almost equidistant from New York City and Tokyo , Anchorage lies within \u200b9 1\u20442 hours by air of nearly 90% of the industrialized world . For this reason , Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport is a common refueling stop for international cargo flights and home to a major FedEx hub , which the company calls a critical part of its global network of services .

Ketchikan is named after Ketchikan Creek , which flows through the town , emptying into the Tongass Narrows a short distance southeast of its downtown . Ketchikan comes from the Tlingit name for the creek , Kitschk-hin , the meaning of which is unclear .
