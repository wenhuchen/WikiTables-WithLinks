An easy-to-understand one-page explanation of rights , with associated visual symbols , explains the specifics of each Creative Commons license . Creative Commons licenses do not replace copyright but are based upon it . They replace individual negotiations for specific rights between copyright owner ( licensor ) and licensee , which are necessary under an all rights reserved copyright management , with a some rights reserved management employing standardized licenses for re-use cases where no commercial compensation is sought by the copyright owner . The result is an agile , low-overhead and low-cost copyright-management regime , benefiting both copyright owners and licensees . The organization was founded in 2001 by Lawrence Lessig , Hal Abelson , and Eric Eldred with the support of Center for the Public Domain . The first article in a general interest publication about Creative Commons , written by Hal Plotkin , was published in February 2002 . The first set of copyright licenses was released in December 2002 . The founding management team that developed the licenses and built the Creative Commons infrastructure as we know it today included Molly Shaffer Van Houweling , Glenn Otis Brown , Neeru Paharia , and Ben Adida .
