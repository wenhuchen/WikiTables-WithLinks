He is remembered for his remarkable breakthroughs in the causes and prevention of diseases , and his discoveries have saved many lives ever since . He reduced mortality from puerperal fever , and created the first vaccines for rabies and anthrax . His medical discoveries provided direct support for the germ theory of disease and its application in clinical medicine .

He is regarded as one of the three main founders of bacteriology , together with Ferdinand Cohn and Robert Koch , and is popularly known as the father of microbiology . Pasteur was responsible for disproving the doctrine of spontaneous generation . He performed experiments that showed that without contamination , microorganisms could not develop . Under the auspices of the French Academy of Sciences , he demonstrated that in sterilized and sealed flasks nothing ever developed , and in sterilized but open flasks microorganisms could grow . Although Pasteur was not the first to propose the germ theory , his experiments indicated its correctness and convinced most of Europe that it was true . Today , he is often regarded as one of the fathers of germ theory .

Traditionally , it is synonymous both with the biblical Land of Israel and with the region of Palestine . The term Holy Land usually refers to a territory roughly corresponding to the modern State of Israel , the Palestinian territories , western Jordan , and parts of southern Lebanon and of southwestern Syria . Jews , Christians , and Muslims all regard it as holy . Part of the significance of the land stems from the religious significance of Jerusalem ( the holiest city to Judaism ) , as the historical region of Jesus ' ministry , and as the site of the Isra and Mi'raj event of c. 621 CE in Islam . The holiness of the land as a destination of Christian pilgrimage contributed to launching the Crusades , as European Christians sought to win back the Holy Land from the Muslims , who had conquered it from the Christian Eastern Roman Empire in the 630s . In the 19th century , the Holy Land became the subject of diplomatic wrangling as the Holy Places played a role in the Eastern Question which led to the Crimean War in the 1850s . Many sites in the Holy Land have long been pilgrimage destinations for adherents of the Abrahamic religions , including Jews , Christians , Muslims , and Bah\u00e1'\u00eds . Pilgrims visit the Holy Land to touch and see physical manifestations of their faith , to confirm their beliefs in the holy context with collective excitation , and to connect personally to the Holy Land .",

  "/wiki/Carrier_pigeon": "The true messenger pigeon is a variety of domestic pigeon ( Columba livia domestica ) derived from the wild rock dove , selectively bred for its ability to find its way home over extremely long distances . The rock dove has an innate homing ability , meaning that it will generally return to its nest ( it is believed ) using magnetoreception . This made it relatively easy to breed from the birds that repeatedly found their way home over long distances . Flights as long as 1,800 km ( 1,100 miles ) have been recorded by birds in competitive pigeon racing . Their average flying speed over moderate 965 km ( 600 miles ) distances is around 97 km/h ( 60 miles per hour ) and speeds of up to 160 km/h ( 100 miles per hour ) have been observed in top racers for short [ clarification needed ] distances . Because of this skill , domesticated pigeons were used to carry messages as messenger pigeons . They are usually referred to as pigeon post if used in post service , or war pigeon during wars . Until the introduction of telephones , homing pigeons were used commercially to deliver communication . Messenger pigeons are often incorrectly categorized as English Carrier pigeons , an ancient breed of fancy pigeons . They were used historically to send messages but lost the homing instinct long ago . Modern-day homing pigeons ( homers ) or racing pigeons ( racing homers ) do have Carrier blood in them because they are in part descendants of the old-style Carriers . This is one reason why they are still commonly but erroneously called carrier pigeons .",

It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing .

By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",
  "/wiki/Himalayan_Mountains": "The Himalayas , or Himalaya ( /\u02cch\u026am\u0259\u02c8le\u026a\u0259 , h\u026a\u02c8m\u0251\u02d0l\u0259j\u0259/ ) , is a mountain range in Asia separating the plains of the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau . The range has many of Earth 's highest peaks , including the highest , Mount Everest ( Nepal/China ) . The Himalayas include over fifty mountains exceeding 7,200 m ( 23,600 ft ) in elevation , including ten of the fourteen 8,000-metre peaks . By contrast , the highest peak outside Asia ( Aconcagua , in the Andes ) is 6,961 m ( 22,838 ft ) tall . Lifted by the subduction of the Indian tectonic plate under the Eurasian Plate , the Himalayan mountain range runs west-northwest to east-southeast in an arc 2,400 km ( 1,500 mi ) long . Its western anchor , Nanga Parbat , lies just south of the northernmost bend of Indus river . Its eastern anchor , Namcha Barwa , is just west of the great bend of the Yarlung Tsangpo River ( upper stream of the Brahmaputra River ) . The Himalayan range is bordered on the northwest by the Karakoram and the Hindu Kush ranges . To the north , the chain is separated from the Tibetan Plateau by a 50-60 km ( 31-37 mi ) wide tectonic valley called the Indus-Tsangpo Suture . Towards the south the arc of the Himalaya is ringed by the very low Indo-Gangetic Plain . The range varies in width from 350 km ( 220 mi ) in the west ( Pakistan ) to 150 km ( 93 mi ) in the east ( Arunachal Pradesh ) . The Himalayas are distinct from the other great ranges of central Asia , although sometimes the term 'Himalaya ' ( or 'Greater Himalayas ' ) is loosely used to include the Karakoram and some of the other ranges .",
  "/wiki/J._B._S._Haldane": "John Burdon Sanderson Haldane FRS ( /\u02c8h\u0254\u02d0lde\u026an/ ; 5 November 1892 - 1 December 1964 ) was a British-Indian scientist known for his work in the study of physiology , genetics , evolutionary biology , and mathematics . He made innovative contributions to the fields of statistics and biostatistics . His article on abiogenesis in 1929 introduced the primordial soup theory , and it became the foundation to build physical models for the chemical origin of life . Haldane established human gene maps for haemophilia and colour blindness on the X chromosome , and codified Haldane 's rule on sterility in the heterogametic sex of hybrids in species . He correctly proposed that sickle-cell disease confers some immunity to malaria . He was the first to suggest the central idea of in vitro fertilisation , as well as concepts such as hydrogen economy , cis and trans-acting regulation , coupling reaction , molecular repulsion , the darwin ( as a unit of evolution ) and organismal cloning . In 1957 he articulated Haldane 's dilemma , a limit on the speed of beneficial evolution which subsequently proved incorrect . He willed his body for medical studies , as he wanted to remain useful even in death . He is also remembered for coining the words clone and cloning in human biology , and ectogenesis . Haldane 's first paper in 1915 demonstrated genetic linkage in mammals . Subsequent works established a unification of Mendelian genetics and Darwinian evolution by natural selection whilst laying the groundwork for modern evolutionary synthesis and thus helped to create population genetics . Haldane was a professed socialist , Marxist , atheist and humanist whose political dissent led him to leave England in 1956 and live in India , becoming a naturalised Indian citizen in 1961 .",

  "/wiki/Soviet_Union": "The Soviet Union , [ b ] officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR or \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 ) , [ c ] was a federal sovereign state in northern Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991 . Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas ."
