The degree was first awarded in the United States in the early 20th century and was created as a modern version of the old European doctor of law degree ( such as the Dottore in Giurisprudenza in Italy and the Juris Utriusque Doctor in Germany and central Europe ) . Originating from the 19th-century Harvard movement for the scientific study of law and first denominated LL.B. , it is a degree that in most common law jurisdictions is the primary professional preparation for lawyers .
