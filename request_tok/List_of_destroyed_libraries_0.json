  "/wiki/Qin_China": "The Qin dynasty ( [ t\u0255\u02b0i\u0301n ] Chinese : \u79e6\u671d ; pinyin : Q\u00ednch\u00e1o ; Wade-Giles : Ch\u02bbin\u00b2-ch\u02bbao\u00b2 ) was the first dynasty of Imperial China , lasting from 221 to 206 BC . Named for its heartland in Qin state ( modern Gansu and Shaanxi ) , the dynasty was founded by Qin Shi Huang , the First Emperor of Qin . The strength of the Qin state was greatly increased by the Legalist reforms of Shang Yang in the fourth century BC , during the Warring States period . In the mid and late third century BC , the Qin state carried out a series of swift conquests , first ending the powerless Zhou dynasty , and eventually conquering the other six of the Seven Warring States . Its 15 years was the shortest major dynasty in Chinese history , consisting of only two emperors , but inaugurated an imperial system that lasted from 221 BC , with interruption and adaptation , until 1912 AD . The Qin sought to create a state unified by structured centralized political power and a large military supported by a stable economy . The central government moved to undercut aristocrats and landowners to gain direct administrative control over the peasantry , who comprised the overwhelming majority of the population and labour force . This allowed ambitious projects involving three hundred thousand peasants and convicts , such as connecting walls along the northern border , eventually developing into the Great Wall of China . The Qin introduced a range of reforms such as standardized currency , weights , measures , and a uniform system of writing , which aimed to unify the state and promote commerce . Additionally , its military used the most recent weaponry , transportation , and tactics , though the government was heavy-handedly bureaucratic . Han Confucians portrayed the legalistic Qin dynasty as a monolithic tyranny , notably citing a purge known as the burning of books and burying of scholars although some modern scholars dispute the veracity of these accounts . When the first emperor died in 210 BC , two of his advisers placed an heir on the throne in an attempt to influence and control the administration of the dynasty .",

A noble of Xiaxiang ( \u4e0b\u76f8 ; present-day Suqian , Jiangsu ) , Xiang Yu rebelled against the Qin dynasty and became a prominent warlord . He was granted the title of Duke of Lu ( \u9b6f\u516c ) by King Huai II of the restoring Chu state in 208 BC .

He was born Ying Zheng ( \u5b34\u653f ) or Zhao Zheng ( \u8d99\u653f ) , a prince of the state of Qin . He became Zheng , the King of Qin ( \u79e6\u738b\u653f ) when he was thirteen , then China 's first emperor when he was 38 after the Qin had conquered all of the other Warring States and unified all of China in 221 BC .

His self-invented title emperor ( \u7687\u5e1d hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec ) , as indicated by his use of the word First , would continue to be borne by Chinese rulers for the next two millennia . During his reign , his generals greatly expanded the size of the Chinese state : campaigns south of Chu permanently added the Yue lands of Hunan and Guangdong to the Chinese cultural orbit ; campaigns in Central Asia conquered the Ordos Loop from the nomad Xiongnu , although eventually it would also lead to their confederation under Modu Chanyu . Qin Shi Huang also worked with his minister Li Si to enact major economic and political reforms aimed at the standardization of the diverse practices of the earlier Chinese states . He is traditionally said to have banned and burned many books and executed scholars , though a closer examination renders the account doubtful . His public works projects included the unification of diverse state walls into a single Great Wall of China and a massive new national road system , as well as the city-sized mausoleum guarded by the life-sized Terracotta Army . He ruled until his death in 210 BC during his fourth tour of Eastern China .",

As a court scholar , Sima had every reason to denigrate the previous emperor to flatter his own and later Confucians did not question the story . As one recent historian put it , their message was If you take our life , Heaven will take the life of your dynasty . Scholars do agree that the First Emperor indeed gathered and destroyed many works that he regarded as incorrect or subversive , but he ordered two copies of each school to be preserved in imperial libraries ( some were destroyed in the fighting following the fall of the dynasty ) . He did have scholars killed , but not by being buried alive , and the victims were not Confucians , since that school had not yet been formed as such .",

With a population of 5,200,000 , Alexandria is the largest city on the Mediterranean , the sixth-largest city in the Arab world and the ninth-largest in Africa . The city extends about 40 km ( 25 mi ) at the northern coast of Egypt along the Mediterranean Sea . Alexandria is a popular tourist destination , and also an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez . Alexandria was founded in c. 331 BC by Alexander the Great , king of Macedon and leader of the Greek League of Corinth , during his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire . An Egyptian village named Rhacotis existed at the location and grew into the Egyptian quarter of Alexandria . Alexandria grew rapidly to become an important center of Hellenistic civilization and remained the capital of Ptolemaic Egypt and Roman and Byzantine Egypt for almost 1,000 years , until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in AD 641 , when a new capital was founded at Fustat ( later absorbed into Cairo ) . Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria ( Pharos ) , one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World ; its Great Library ( the largest in the ancient world ) ; and the Necropolis , one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages . Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural center of the ancient Mediterranean world for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity . It was at one time the largest city in the ancient world before being eventually overtaken by Rome . The city was a major center of early Christianity and was the center of the Patriarchate of Alexandria , which was one of the major centers of Christianity in the Eastern Roman Empire . In the modern world , the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage .",
  "/wiki/Ancient_Egypt": "Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient North Africa , concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River , situated in the place that is now the country Egypt . Ancient Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3100 BC ( according to conventional Egyptian chronology ) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes ( often identified with Narmer ) . The history of ancient Egypt occurred as a series of stable kingdoms , separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods : the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age , the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age . Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power in the New Kingdom , ruling much of Nubia and a sizable portion of the Near East , after which it entered a period of slow decline . During the course of its history Egypt was invaded or conquered by a number of foreign powers , including the Hyksos , the Libyans , the Nubians , the Assyrians , the Achaemenid Persians , and the Macedonians under the command of Alexander the Great . The Greek Ptolemaic Kingdom , formed in the aftermath of Alexander 's death , ruled Egypt until 30 BC , when , under Cleopatra , it fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman province . The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River valley for agriculture . The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops , which supported a more dense population , and social development and culture . With resources to spare , the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions , the early development of an independent writing system , the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects , trade with surrounding regions , and a military intended to assert Egyptian dominance . Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes , religious leaders , and administrators under the control of a pharaoh , who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs . The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying , surveying and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids , temples , and obelisks ; a system of mathematics , a practical and effective system of medicine , irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques , the first known planked boats , Egyptian faience and glass technology , new forms of literature , and the earliest known peace treaty , made with the Hittites .

His rejection of Christianity , and his promotion of Neoplatonic Hellenism in its place , caused him to be remembered as Julian the Apostate by the Christian church . A member of the Constantinian dynasty , Julian was orphaned as a child . He was raised by the Gothic slave Mardonius , who had a profound influence on him , providing Julian with an excellent education . Julian became caesar over the western provinces by order of Constantius II in 355 , and in this role he campaigned successfully against the Alamanni and Franks .

In 360 , Julian was proclaimed Augustus by his soldiers at Lutetia ( Paris ) , sparking a civil war with Constantius . However , Constantius died before the two could face each other in battle , and named Julian as his successor . In 363 , Julian embarked on an ambitious campaign against the Sassanid Empire . The campaign was initially successful , securing a victory outside Ctesiphon . However , while campaigning into Persian territory , the Persians flooded the area behind him and Julian took a risky decision to withdraw up the valley of the Tigris River .

On accepting his elevation , he campaigned against Goths and other barbarians who had invaded the Empire . His resources were not sufficient to destroy them or drive them out , which had been Roman policy for centuries in dealing with invaders . By treaty , which followed his indecisive victory at the end of the Gothic War , they were established as foederati , autonomous allies of the Empire , south of the Danube , in Illyricum , within the Empire 's borders . They were given lands and allowed to remain under their own leaders , a grave departure from Roman hegemonic ways . This turn away from traditional policies was accommodationist and had grave consequences for the Western Empire from the beginning of the century , as the Romans found themselves with the impossible task of defending the borders and dealing with unruly federates within . Theodosius I was obliged to fight two destructive civil wars , successively defeating the usurpers Magnus Maximus in 387-388 and Eugenius in 394 , though not without material cost to the power of the Empire .

  "/wiki/Al-Andalus": "Al-Andalus [ a ] was the name given by Muslim sources during the Middle Ages to the territory in the Iberian Peninsula culturally and religiously linked with them . At its greatest geographical extent , it occupied the northwest of the Iberian peninsula and a part of present-day southern France , Septimania ( 8th century ) , and for nearly a century ( 9th-10th centuries ) extended its control from Fraxinet over the Alpine passes which connect Italy with the remainder of Western Europe . The name more specifically describes the different Arab or Berber states that controlled these territories at various times between 711 and 1492 , though the boundaries changed constantly as the Christian Reconquista progressed , eventually shrinking to the south and finally to the vassalage of the Emirate of Granada . Following the Umayyad conquest of Hispania , al-Andalus , then at its greatest extent , was divided into five administrative units , corresponding roughly to modern Andalusia ; Portugal and Galicia ; Castile and Le\u00f3n ; Navarre , Aragon , and Catalonia ; and the Languedoc-Roussillon area of Occitanie . As a political domain , it successively constituted a province of the Umayyad Caliphate , initiated by the Caliph Al-Walid I ( 711-750 ) ; the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba ( c. 750-929 ) ; the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba ( 929-1031 ) ; and the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba 's taifa ( successor ) kingdoms . Rule under these kingdoms led to a rise in cultural exchange and cooperation between Muslims and Christians . Christians and Jews were subject to a special tax called Jizya , to the state , which in return provided internal autonomy in practicing their religion and offered the same level of protections by the Muslim rulers . The jizya was not only a tax , however , but also a symbolic expression of subordination . Under the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba , al-Andalus was a beacon of learning , and the city of C\u00f3rdoba , the largest in Europe , became one of the leading cultural and economic centres throughout the Mediterranean Basin , Europe , and the Islamic world . Achievements that advanced Islamic and Western science came from al-Andalus , including major advances in trigonometry ( Geber ) , astronomy ( Arzachel ) , surgery ( Abulcasis ) , pharmacology ( Avenzoar ) , agronomy ( Ibn Bassal and Ab\u016b l-Khayr al-Ishb\u012bl\u012b ) , and other fields . Al-Andalus became a major educational center for Europe and the lands around the Mediterranean Sea as well as a conduit for cultural and scientific exchange between the Islamic and Christian worlds . For much of its history , al-Andalus existed in conflict with Christian kingdoms to the north .",

Born in an alqueria on the outskirts of Torrox to a family of Yemeni Arab origin with some juridical ancestors , ibn Abi \u02bf\u0100mir left for C\u00f3rdoba when still young to be trained as a Faq\u012bh . After a few humble beginnings , he joined the court administration and soon gained the confidence of Subh , mother of the children of Caliph Al-Hakam II . Thanks to her patronage and his own efficiency , he quickly expanded his role . During the caliphate of Al-Hakam II , he held several important administrative positions , including director of the mint ( 967 ) , administrator for Subh and her children , and for intestate inheritances , and quartermaster for the army of General Ghalib ibn Abd al-Rahman ( 973 ) . The death of the caliph in 976 marked the beginning of the domination of the Caliphate by this functionary , which continued beyond his death with the government of two of his sons , first Abd al-Malik al-Muzaffar and then Abd al-Rahman Sanchuelo , up to 1009 . As chamberlain of the caliphate ( from 978 ) , he exercised extraordinary power in the al-Andalus state , throughout the Iberian peninsula and in part of the Maghreb , while Caliph , Hisham II was reduced almost to figurehead status . His portentous rise to power has been explained by an insatiable thirst for dominance , but historian Eduardo Manzano Moreno warns that it must be understood within the framework of the complex internal struggles that developed within the Umayyad administration . He received the pragmatic support of religious authorities for his control of political power , though not without without periodic tensions between them . The basis of his power was his defense of jihad , which he proclaimed in the name of the Caliph . His image as a champion of Islam served to justify his assumption of governmental authority . Having monopolized political dominance in the caliphate , he carried out profound reforms in both foreign and domestic politics .",

Historically known as Rhages ( /\u02c8re\u026ad\u0292\u0259z/ ) , Rhagae and Arsacia , Ray is the oldest existing city in Tehran Province . In the classical era , it was a prominent city belonging to Media , the political and cultural base of the Medes . Ancient Persian inscriptions and the Avesta ( Zoroastrian scriptures ) , among other sources , attest to the importance of ancient Ray . Ray is mentioned several times in the Apocrypha . It is also shown on the 4th-century Peutinger Map . The city was subject to severe destruction during the medieval invasions by the Arabs , Turks , and Mongols . Its position as a capital city was revived during the reigns of the Buyid Daylamites and the Seljuk Turks . Ray is richer than many other ancient cities in the number of its historical monuments . The Neolithic site of Cheshme-Ali , the reconstructed Median-era Rey Castle , the Parthian-era Rashkan Castle , the Sasanian-era Zoroastrian Fire Temple of Bahram , and the once Zoroastrian and now Islamic Shrine of Bibi Shahrbanu are among the many archaeological sites in Ray .

Coupled with the rise of other Iranian dynasties in the region , the approximate century of Buyid rule represents the period in Iranian history sometimes called the 'Iranian Intermezzo ' since , after the Muslim conquest of Persia , it was an interlude between the rule of the Abbasid Caliphate and the Seljuk Empire . The Buyid dynasty was founded by 'Ali ibn Buya , who in 934 conquered Fars and made Shiraz his capital . His younger brother Hasan ibn Buya conquered parts of Jibal in the late 930s , and by 943 managed to capture Ray , which he made his capital . In 945 , the youngest brother , Ahmad ibn Buya , conquered Iraq and made Baghdad his capital . He received the laqab or honorific title of Mu'izz al-Dawla ( Fortifier of the State ) . The eldest , 'Ali , was given the title of 'Imad al-Dawla ( Support of the State ) , and Hasan was given the title of Rukn al-Dawla ( Pillar of the State ) . As Daylamite Iranians , the Buyids consciously revived symbols and practices of Iran 's Sasanian Empire . Beginning with 'Adud al-Dawla , they used the ancient Sasanian title Shahanshah ( \u0634\u0627\u0647\u0646\u0634\u0627\u0647 ) , literally king of kings . At its greatest extent , the Buyid dynasty encompassed territory of most of today 's Iran , Iraq , Kuwait , and Syria , along with parts of Oman , the UAE , Turkey , Afghanistan and Pakistan .

  "/wiki/Fatimid_Caliphate": "The Fatimid Caliphate was an Ismaili Shia caliphate that spanned a large area of North Africa , from the Red Sea in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the west .

In 921 , the Fatimids established the Tunisian city of Mahdia as their new capital . In 948 they shifted their capital to al-Mansuriyya , near Kairouan in Tunisia . In 969 they conquered Egypt and established Cairo as the capital of their caliphate ; Egypt became the political , cultural , and religious centre of their empire that developed a new , indigenous Arabic culture . The ruling class belonged to the Ismai'li branch of Shi ' a Islam , as did the leaders of the dynasty . The existence of the caliphate marked the only time the descendants of Ali and Fatimah were united to any degree ( except for the final period of the Rashidun Caliphate under Ali himself from 656 to 661 ) and the name Fatimid refers to Fatimah . The different term Fatimi or Fatimite by orientalist authors are sometimes used to refer to the caliphate 's subjects .

From c. 1150-1250 , the Seljuk empire declined , and was invaded by the Mongols around 1260 . The Mongols divided Anatolia into emirates . Eventually one of these , the Ottoman , would conquer the rest . Seljuk gave his name to both the empire and the Seljuk dynasty . The Seljuks united the fractured political landscape of the eastern Islamic world and played a key role in the first and second crusades . Highly Persianized in culture and language , the Seljuks also played an important role in the development of the Turko-Persian tradition , even exporting Persian culture to Anatolia .",
  "/wiki/Oghuz_Turks": "The Oghuz , Oguz or Ghuzz Turks ( Middle Turkic : \u0671\u063a\u064f\u0632 O\u03b3uz , Old Turkic : \ud803\udc06\ud803\udc0d\ud803\udc14 , romanized : O\u03b3uz ) were western Turkic people who spoke the Oghuz languages from the Common branch of the Turkic language family . In the 8th century , they formed a tribal confederation conventionally named the Oghuz Yabgu State in central Asia . The name Oghuz is a Common Turkic word for tribe . Byzantine sources call the Oghuz the Uzes ( \u039f\u1f50\u0311\u03b6\u03bf\u03b9 , Ouzoi ) . By the 10th century , Islamic sources were calling them Muslim Turkmens , as opposed to shamanist or Buddhist . By the 12th century this term had passed into Byzantine usage and the Oghuzes were overwhelmingly Muslim . The term 'Oghuz ' was gradually supplanted among the Turks themselves by Turkmen and Turcoman , ( Ottoman Turkish : \u062a\u0631\u0643\u0645\u0646\u0644\u0631 , romanized : T\u00fcrkmen or T\u00fcrkm\u00e2n ) from the mid 900 's on , a process which was completed by the beginning of the 1200s . Mahmud al-Kashgari says that Turkmen has a broader meaning by saying that Karluks are also Turkmens but differ from Oghuz . The Oghuz confederation migrated westward from the Jeti-su area after a conflict with the Karluk allies of the Uyghurs . Today , a percentage of the residents of Turkey , Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are descendants of Oghuz Turks and their language belongs to the Oghuz group of the Turkic languages family . In the 9th century , the Oghuzes from the Aral steppes drove Bechens from the Emba and Ural River region toward the west . In the 10th century , they inhabited the steppe of the rivers Sari-su , Turgai , and Emba to the north of Lake Balkhash of modern-day Kazakhstan .",
  "/wiki/Nalanda": "Nalanda ( IAST : N\u0101land\u0101 ; /na\u02d0l\u0259n\u032ad\u032aa\u02d0/ ) was an ancient Mahavihara , a large and revered Buddhist monastery , in the ancient kingdom of Magadha ( modern-day Bihar ) in India . The site is located about 95 kilometres ( 59 mi ) southeast of Patna near the city of Bihar Sharif , and was an important centre of learning from the fifth century CE to c. 1200 CE . Today , it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The highly formalized methods of Vedic scholarship helped inspire the establishment of large teaching institutions such as Taxila , Nalanda , and Vikramashila , which are often characterised as India 's early universities . Nalanda flourished under the patronage of the Gupta Empire in the 5th and 6th centuries , and later under Harsha , the emperor of Kannauj . The liberal cultural traditions inherited from the Gupta age resulted in a period of growth and prosperity until the ninth century CE . The subsequent centuries were a time of gradual decline , a period during which the tantric developments of Buddhism became most pronounced in eastern India under the Pala Empire . At its peak the school attracted scholars and students from near and far , with some travelling from Tibet , China , Korea , and Central Asia . Archaeological evidence also notes contact with the Shailendra dynasty of Indonesia , one of whose kings built a monastery in the complex . Much of our knowledge of Nalanda comes from the writings of pilgrim monks from Asia , such as Xuanzang and Yijing , who travelled to the Mahavihara in the 7th century CE . Vincent Smith remarked that a detailed history of Nalanda would be a history of Mahayanist Buddhism . Many of the names listed by Xuanzang in his travelogue as alumni of Nalanda are the names of those who developed the overall philosophy of Mahayana .",

  "/wiki/Decline_of_Buddhism_in_India": "The decline of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent refers to a gradual process of dwindling and replacement of Buddhism in India , which ended around the 12th century . According to Lars Fogelin , this was not a singular event , with a singular cause ; it was a centuries-long process . The decline of Buddhism has been attributed to various factors , especially the regionalisation of India after the end of the Gupta Empire ( 320-650 CE ) , which led to the loss of patronage and donations as Indian dynasties turned to the services of Hindu Brahmins . Another factor was invasions of north India by various groups such as Huns , Turco-mongols and Persians and subsequent destruction of Buddhist institutions such as Nalanda and religious persecutions . Religious competition with Hinduism and later Islam were also important factors . Islamization of Bengal and demolitions of Nalanda , Vikramasila and Odantapuri by Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji , a general of the Delhi Sultanate are thought to have severely weakened the practice of Buddhism in East India . The total Buddhist population in 2010 in the Indian subcontinent - excluding that of Sri Lanka , Nepal and Bhutan - was about 10 million , of which about 7.2% lived in Bangladesh , 92.5% in India and 0.2% in Pakistan .",
  "/wiki/Imperial_Library_of_Constantinople": "The Imperial Library of Constantinople , in the capital city of the Byzantine Empire , was the last of the great libraries of the ancient world .

Donald Queller notes that there is no indication of the continued existence of a formal imperial library at the time and no source mentions lost manuscripts . While there were many reports of texts surviving into the Ottoman era , no substantive portion of the library has ever been recovered . The library was founded by Constantius II ( reigned 337-361 AD ) who established a Scriptorium so that the surviving works of Greek literature could be copied for preservation . The Emperor Valens in 372 employed four Greek and three Latin calligraphers .

In 1923 the capital of Turkey , the successor state of the Ottoman Empire , was moved to Ankara and the name Constantinople was officially changed to Istanbul ; the city is still referred to as Constantinople in Greek-speaking sources . The city is located in what is now the European side and the core of modern Istanbul . In 324 the ancient city of Byzantium became the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great , after whom it was renamed , and dedicated on 11 May 330 . From the mid-5th century to the early 13th century , Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe . The city became famous for its architectural masterpieces , such as Hagia Sophia , the cathedral of the Eastern Orthodox Church , which served as the seat of the Ecumenical Patriarchate , the sacred Imperial Palace where the Emperors lived , the Galata Tower , the Hippodrome , the Golden Gate of the Land Walls , and the opulent aristocratic palaces lining the arcaded avenues and squares . The University of Constantinople was founded in the fifth century and contained numerous artistic and literary treasures before it was sacked in 1204 and 1453 , including its vast Imperial Library which contained the remnants of the Library of Alexandria and had over 100,000 volumes of ancient texts .

  "/wiki/Byzantine_Empire": "The Byzantine Empire , also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire , or Byzantium , was the continuation of the Roman Empire in its eastern provinces during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages , when its capital city was Constantinople ( modern Istanbul , formerly Byzantium ) . It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 . During most of its existence , the empire was the most powerful economic , cultural and military force in Europe . Byzantine Empire is a term created after the end of the realm ; its citizens continued to refer to their empire simply as the Roman Empire ( Greek : \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd , tr .

Several signal events from the 4th to 6th centuries mark the period of transition during which the Roman Empire 's Greek East and Latin West diverged . Constantine I ( r. 324-337 ) reorganised the empire , made Constantinople the new capital and legalised Christianity . Under Theodosius I ( r. 379-395 ) , Christianity became the state religion and other religious practices were proscribed . In the reign of Heraclius ( r. 610-641 ) , the Empire 's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use in place of Latin . Although the Roman state continued and its traditions were maintained , modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome insofar as it was centred on Constantinople , oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture and characterised by Eastern Orthodox Christianity . The borders of the empire fluctuated through cycles of decline and recovery . During the reign of Justinian I ( r. 527-565 ) , the empire reached its greatest extent , after reconquering much of the historically Roman western Mediterranean coast , including North Africa , Italy and Rome , which it held for two more centuries .",
  "/wiki/Fourth_Crusade": "The Fourth Crusade ( 1202-1204 ) was a Latin Christian armed expedition called by Pope Innocent III . The stated intent of the expedition was to recapture the Muslim-controlled city of Jerusalem , by first conquering the powerful Egyptian Ayyubid Sultanate , the strongest Muslim state of the time . However , a sequence of economic and political events culminated in the Crusader army sacking the city of Constantinople , the capital of the Greek Christian-controlled Byzantine Empire , rather than Egypt as originally planned . In late 1202 , financial issues led to the Crusader army sacking Zara , a Catholic city on the Adriatic Sea which was then brought under Venetian control . When the pope heard of this , he excommunicated the crusader army . In January 1203 , en route to Jerusalem , the Crusader leadership entered into an agreement with the Byzantine prince Alexios Angelos to divert the Crusade to Constantinople and restore his deposed father as emperor . The intent of the Crusaders was then to continue to Jerusalem with promised Byzantine financial and military aid . On 23 June 1203 , the main Crusader army reached Constantinople , while other contingents ( perhaps a majority of all crusaders ) continued to Acre . In August , following clashes outside Constantinople , Alexios was crowned co-emperor . However , in January 1204 he was deposed by a popular uprising . The Crusaders were no longer able to receive their promised payments from Alexios . Following the murder of Alexios on 8 February , the Crusaders decided on the outright conquest of the city .",

  "/wiki/Mongol_Empire": "The Mongol Empire existed during the 13th and 14th centuries , and was the largest contiguous land empire in history . Originating in Mongolia , the Mongol Empire eventually stretched from Eastern Europe and parts of Central Europe to the Sea of Japan , extending northward into parts of Siberia ; eastward and southward into the Indian subcontinent , Mainland Southeast Asia and the Iranian Plateau ; and westward as far as the Levant and the Carpathian Mountains . The Mongol Empire emerged from the unification of several nomadic tribes in the Mongol homeland under the leadership of Genghis Khan ( c. 1162-1227 ) , whom a council proclaimed ruler of all the Mongols in 1206 . The empire grew rapidly under his rule and that of his descendants , who sent out invading armies in every direction . The vast transcontinental empire connected the East with the West in an enforced Pax Mongolica , allowing the dissemination and exchange of trade , technologies , commodities and ideologies across Eurasia . The empire began to split due to wars over succession , as the grandchildren of Genghis Khan disputed whether the royal line should follow from his son and initial heir \u00d6gedei or from one of his other sons , such as Tolui , Chagatai , or Jochi . The Toluids prevailed after a bloody purge of \u00d6gedeid and Chagataid factions , but disputes continued among the descendants of Tolui . A key reason for the split was the dispute over whether the Mongol Empire would become a sedentary , cosmopolitan empire , or would stay true to the Mongol nomadic and steppe-based lifestyle . After M\u00f6ngke Khan died ( 1259 ) , rival kurultai councils simultaneously elected different successors , the brothers Ariq B\u00f6ke and Kublai Khan , who fought each other in the Toluid Civil War ( 1260-1264 ) and also dealt with challenges from the descendants of other sons of Genghis . Kublai successfully took power , but civil war ensued as he sought unsuccessfully to regain control of the Chagatayid and \u00d6gedeid families . During the reigns of Genghis and \u00d6gedei , the Mongols suffered the occasional defeat when a less skilled general received a command . The Siberian Tumeds defeated the Mongol forces under Borokhula around 1215-1217 ; Jalal al-Din defeated Shigi-Qutugu at the Battle of Parwan in 1221 ; and the Jin generals Heda and Pu ' a defeated Dolqolqu in 1230 .",

The House of Wisdom is the subject of an active dispute over its functions and existence as a formal academy , an issue complicated by a lack of physical evidence following the collapse of the Abbasid Caliphate and a reliance on corroboration of literary sources to construct a narrative . The House of Wisdom was founded either as a library for the collections of the Caliph Harun al-Rashid in the late 8th century ( then later turned into a public academy during the reign of Al-Ma'mun ) or was a private collection created by Al-Mansur ( reign 754-775 ) to house rare books and collections of poetry in both Arabic and Persian .

Located along the Tigris River , the city was founded in the 8th century and became the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate . Within a short time of its inception , Baghdad evolved into a significant cultural , commercial , and intellectual center of the Muslim world . This , in addition to housing several key academic institutions , including the House of Wisdom , as well as hosting a multiethnic and multireligious environment , garnered the city a worldwide reputation as the Centre of Learning . Baghdad was the largest city in the world for much of the Abbasid era during the Islamic Golden Age , peaking at a population of more than a million .

The Mongols were under the command of Hulagu Khan ( or Hulegu Khan ) , brother of the khagan M\u00f6ngke Khan , who had intended to further extend his rule into Mesopotamia but not to directly overthrow the Caliphate . M\u00f6ngke , however , had instructed Hulagu to attack Baghdad if the Caliph Al-Musta'sim refused Mongol demands for his continued submission to the khagan and the payment of tribute in the form of military support for Mongol forces in Persia . Hulagu began his campaign in Persia with several offensives against Nizari groups , including the Assassins , who lost their stronghold of Alamut . He then marched on Baghdad , demanding that Al-Musta'sim accede to the terms imposed by M\u00f6ngke on the Abbasids . Although the Abbasids had failed to prepare for the invasion , the Caliph believed that Baghdad could not fall to invading forces and refused to surrender . Hulagu subsequently besieged the city , which surrendered after 12 days . During the next week , the Mongols sacked Baghdad , committing numerous atrocities and destroying the Abbasids ' vast libraries , including the House of Wisdom . The Mongols executed Al-Musta'sim and massacred many residents of the city , which was left greatly depopulated . The siege is considered to mark the end of the Islamic Golden Age , during which the caliphs had extended their rule from the Iberian Peninsula to Sindh , and which was also marked by many cultural achievements in diverse fields .",

In the early stages , the lands that were ruled by the Habsburg Hungarian kings were regarded both as the Kingdom of Hungary and Royal Hungary . Royal Hungary was the symbol of the continuity of formal law after the Ottoman occupation , because it could preserve its legal traditions . however in general it was de facto a Habsburg province . The Hungarian nobility forced Vienna to admit that Hungary was a special unit of the Habsburg lands and had to be ruled in conformity with her own special laws .

The Spanish conquest of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula was hindered by its politically fragmented state . The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns . Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish . Among the Maya , ambush was a favoured tactic . Spanish weaponry included broadswords , rapiers , lances , pikes , halberds , crossbows , matchlocks and light artillery . Maya warriors fought with flint-tipped spears , bows and arrows and stones , and wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves . The Spanish introduced a number of Old World diseases previously unknown in the Americas , initiating devastating plagues that swept through the native populations . The first encounter with the Yucatec Maya may have occurred in 1502 , when the fourth voyage of Christopher Columbus came across a large trading canoe off Honduras .
