  "intro": "The UEFA Women's Champions League, previously called the UEFA Women's Cup (2001-09), is an international women's association football competition. It involves the top club teams from countries affiliated with the European governing body UEFA. The competition was first played in 2001-02 under the name UEFA Women's Cup, and renamed the Champions League for the 2009-10 edition. The most significant changes in 2009 were the inclusion of runners-up from the top eight ranked nations, a one-off final as opposed to the two-legged finals in previous years, and - until 2018 - playing the final in the same city as the men's UEFA Champions League final. From the 2021-22 season, the competition proper will include a group stage for the first time in the Women's Champions League era. Lyon is the most successful club in the competition's history, winning the title six times."
