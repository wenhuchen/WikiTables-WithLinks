  "/wiki/Rugby_union_positions": "In the game of rugby union , there are 15 players on each team , comprising eight forwards ( wearing jerseys numbered 1-8 ) and seven backs ( numbered 9-15 ) . In addition , there may be up to eight replacement players on the bench , numbered 16-23 . Players are not restricted to a single position , although they generally specialise in just one or two that suit their skills and body types . Players that play multiple positions are called utility players . Forwards compete for the ball in scrums and line-outs and are generally bigger and stronger than the backs . Props push in the scrums , while the hooker tries to secure the ball for their team by hooking it back with their heel . The hooker is also the one who is responsible for throwing the ball in at line-outs , where it is mostly competed for by the locks , who are generally the tallest players on the team . The flankers and number eight are expected to be the first players to arrive at a breakdown and play an important role in securing possession of the ball for their team . The backs play behind the forwards and are usually more lightly built and faster . Successful backs are skilful at passing and kicking . Full-backs need to be good defenders and kickers , and have the ability to catch a kicked ball . The wingers are usually among the fastest players in a team and score many of the tries .",

Two previous tours had been conducted by New Zealand representative sides to Australia ; the first in 1884 was conducted without the oversight of a national body , and in 1893 , after the formation of the New Zealand Football Rugby Union a second tour was conducted . Armit 's province , Otago , had initially refused to join the NZRFU ( and so the 1893 side included no Otago players ) , but they joined in 1895 , making Otago-based players eligible for selection for the 1897 tour . Armit played nine matches on the ten-match tour and in the process scored seven tries , including one try each in the two matches he played against New South Wales . Despite suffering an injury prior to the tour , Armit recovered enough to play most of the tours ' fixtures , and particularly impressed with his bumping . During the match against Northern New South Wales at Newcastle , he had ball in hand and was attempting to score a try but had an opponent in his way ; Armit continued to run while ramming his shoulder into the player 's abdomen , thereby propelling his opponent over a fence . This was followed by in an incident in the last match against New South Wales where an Armit bump broke the rib of opponent Stan Wickham .",
