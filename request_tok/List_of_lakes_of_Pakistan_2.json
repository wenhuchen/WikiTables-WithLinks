There is a nascent language movement , and in recent decades Hindko-speaking intellectuals have started promoting the view of Hindko as a separate language . There is a literary tradition based on Peshawari , the urban variety of Peshawar in the northwest , and another one based on the language of Abbottabad in the northeast . The term Hindko is a Pashto word most commonly taken to have originally meant the Indian language or language of Hind , [ a ] but it has developed to denote the Indo-Aryan speech forms spoken in the northern Indian subcontinent , in contrast to the neighbouring Pashto , an Iranian language . Hindko is mutually intelligible with Punjabi and Saraiki , and has more affinities with the latter than with the former . Differences with other Punjabi varieties are more pronounced in the morphology and phonology than in the syntax . An alternative local name for this language group is Hindki . [ b ]",
