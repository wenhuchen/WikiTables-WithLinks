It is composed of nine federated states ( Bundesl\u00e4nder ) , one of which is Vienna , Austria 's capital and its largest city . It is bordered by Germany to the northwest , Czech Republic to the north , Slovakia to the northeast , Hungary to the east , Slovenia and Italy to the south , and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west . Austria occupies an area of 83,879 km2 ( 32,386 sq mi ) and has a population of nearly 9 million people . While German is the country 's official language , many Austrians communicate informally in a variety of Bavarian dialects . Austria initially emerged as a margraviate around 976 and developed into a duchy and archduchy . In the 16th century , Austria started serving as the heart of the Habsburg Monarchy and the junior branch of the House of Habsburg - one of the most influential royal dynasties in history . As an archduchy , it was a major component and administrative centre of the Holy Roman Empire . Early in the 19th century , Austria established its own empire , which became a great power and the leading force of the German Confederation but pursued its own course independently of the other German states . Following the Austro-Prussian War and the compromise with Hungary , the Dual Monarchy was established . Austria was involved in World War I under Emperor Franz Joseph following the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand , the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne . After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy , the Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed with the intent of the union with Germany , which eventually failed because of the Allied Powers and the state remained unrecognized .",

  "/wiki/Maria_Theresa": "Maria Theresa Walburga Amalia Christina ( German : Maria Theresia ; 13 May 1717 - 29 November 1780 ) was the only female ruler of the Habsburg dominions and the last of the House of Habsburg . She was the sovereign of Austria , Hungary , Croatia , Bohemia , Transylvania , Mantua , Milan , Lodomeria and Galicia , the Austrian Netherlands , and Parma . By marriage , she was Duchess of Lorraine , Grand Duchess of Tuscany and Holy Roman Empress . She started her 40-year reign when her father , Emperor Charles VI , died in October 1740 . Charles VI paved the way for her accession with the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 and spent his entire reign securing it . He neglected the advice of Prince Eugene of Savoy , who averred that a strong military and a rich treasury were more important than mere signatures . Eventually , he left behind a weakened and impoverished state , particularly due to the War of the Polish Succession and the Russo-Turkish War ( 1735-1739 ) . Moreover , upon his death , Saxony , Prussia , Bavaria , and France all repudiated the sanction they had recognised during his lifetime . Frederick II of Prussia ( who became Maria Theresa 's greatest rival for most of her reign ) promptly invaded and took the affluent Habsburg province of Silesia in the seven-year conflict known as the War of the Austrian Succession . In defiance of the grave situation , she managed to secure the vital support of the Hungarians for the war effort . Over the course of the war , despite the loss of Silesia and a few minor territories in Italy , Maria Theresa successfully defended her rule over most of the Habsburg empire . Maria Theresa later unsuccessfully tried to reconquer Silesia during the Seven Years ' War .",

He was one of the most successful military commanders of his time , and rose to the highest offices of state at the Imperial court in Vienna . Born in Paris , Eugene grew up around the court of King Louis XIV of France . Based on his poor physique and bearing , the Prince was initially prepared for a clerical career , but by the age of 19 he had determined on a military career . Following a scandal involving his mother Olympe , he was rejected by Louis XIV for service in the French army . Eugene moved to Austria and transferred his loyalty to the Habsburg Monarchy . Spanning six decades , Eugene served three Holy Roman Emperors : Leopold I , Joseph I , and Charles VI . He first saw action against the Ottoman Turks at the Siege of Vienna in 1683 and the subsequent War of the Holy League , before serving in the Nine Years ' War , fighting alongside his cousin , the Duke of Savoy . However , the Prince 's fame was secured with his decisive victory against the Ottomans at the Battle of Zenta in 1697 , earning him Europe-wide fame . Eugene enhanced his standing during the War of the Spanish Succession , where his partnership with the Duke of Marlborough secured victories against the French on the fields of Blenheim ( 1704 ) , Oudenarde ( 1708 ) , and Malplaquet ( 1709 ) ; he gained further success in the war as Imperial commander in northern Italy , most notably at the Battle of Turin ( 1706 ) . Renewed hostilities against the Ottomans in the Austro-Turkish War consolidated his reputation , with victories at the battles of Petrovaradin ( 1716 ) , and the decisive encounter at Belgrade ( 1717 ) . Throughout the late 1720s , Eugene 's influence and skillful diplomacy managed to secure the Emperor powerful allies in his dynastic struggles with the Bourbon powers , but physically and mentally fragile in his later years , Eugene enjoyed less success as commander-in-chief of the army during his final conflict , the War of the Polish Succession .",

He was the only legitimate son of Augustus II the Strong , and converted to the Roman Catholicism in 1712 to secure his candidacy for the Polish throne . In 1719 he married Maria Josepha , daughter of Joseph I , Holy Roman Emperor , and became Elector of Saxony following his father 's death in 1733 . Augustus was able to gain the support of Charles VI by agreeing to the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 and also gained recognition from Russian Empress Anna by supporting Russia 's claim to the region of Courland . He was elected king of Poland by a small minority on 5 October 1733 and subsequently banished the former Polish king Stanis\u0142aw I . He was crowned in Krak\u00f3w on 17 January 1734 . Augustus was supportive of Austria against Prussia in the War of the Austrian Succession ( 1742 ) and again in the Seven Years ' War ( 1756 ) , both of which resulted in Saxony being defeated and occupied by the Prussian Kingdom . In Poland , his rule was marked by the increasing influence of the Czartoryski and Poniatowski families , and by the intervention of Catherine the Great in Polish affairs . His rule deepened the social anarchy in Poland and increased the country 's dependence on its neighbours , notably Prussia , Austria and Russia . The Russian Empire prevented him from installing his family on the Polish throne , supporting instead the aristocrat Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski , the lover of Catherine the Great .
