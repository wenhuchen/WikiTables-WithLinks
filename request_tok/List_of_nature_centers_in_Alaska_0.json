The Center ( the largest of its type in the state , and one of the largest in North America ) receives between 100-200 birds a year , with many suffering from gunshot wounds and traffic accident-related trauma . Most of the birds arriving at the center arrive in special containers , having been flown in via the baggage compartments of Alaska Airlines planes . The Center 's goal is to introduce the birds back into the wild , once they are healed and retrained in raptor life skills ( such as flying ) in the enclosed , 20,000-square-foot ( 1,900 m2 ) Bald Eagle Flight-Training Center . Many birds that are no longer able to live outside captivity are sent to zoos and wildlife centers located throughout the United States . A few of the animals that could not be returned to nature have become permanent guests . More than 40,000 visitors annually come to see the two dozen resident eagles , hawks , owls , and ravens , who assist in the Center 's secondary function , that of public education . The most well-known resident is Volta , a bald eagle who suffered permanent damage after a 1992 collision with power lines ( hence the name ) . Though since nursed back to health , Volta now regularly travels to the lower 48 states as an ambassador for the Center ( out of the 100,000 or so bald eagles on Earth , half live in Alaska ) .
