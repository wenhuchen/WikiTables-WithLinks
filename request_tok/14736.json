  "/wiki/Historic_district_(United_States)": "Historic districts in the United States are designated historic districts recognizing a group of buildings , properties , or sites by one of several entities on different levels as historically or architecturally significant . Buildings , structures , objects and sites within a historic district are normally divided into two categories , contributing and non-contributing . Districts greatly vary in size : some have hundreds of structures , while others have just a few . The U.S. federal government designates historic districts through the United States Department of Interior under the auspices of the National Park Service . Federally designated historic districts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places , but listing usually imposes no restrictions on what property owners may do with a designated property . State-level historic districts may follow similar criteria ( no restrictions ) or may require adherence to certain historic rehabilitation standards . Local historic district designation offers , by far , the most legal protection for historic properties because most land use decisions are made at the local level . Local districts are generally administered by the county or municipal government .",
  "/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland .",

[ N 1 ] After 1765 , growing constitutional and political differences strained the relationship between Great Britain and its American colonies . Patriot protests against taxation without representation followed the Stamp Act and escalated into boycotts , which culminated in 1773 with the Sons of Liberty destroying a shipment of tea in Boston Harbor .
