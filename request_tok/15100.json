  "/wiki/Chatterbot": "A chatbot is a piece of software that conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods . Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner , although as of 2019 , they are far short of being able to pass the Turing test . Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition . Some chatbots use sophisticated natural language processing systems , but many simpler ones scan for keywords within the input , then pull a reply with the most matching keywords , or the most similar wording pattern , from a database . The term ChatterBot was originally coined by Michael Mauldin ( creator of the first Verbot , Julia ) in 1994 to describe these conversational programs . Today , most chatbots are accessed via virtual assistants such as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa , via messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger or WeChat , or via individual organizations ' apps and websites . Chatbots can be classified into usage categories that include conversational commerce ( e-commerce via chat ) , education , entertainment , finance , health , news , and productivity . Beyond chatbots , Conversational AI refers to the use of messaging apps , speech-based assistants and chatbots to automate communication and create personalized customer experiences at scale .",

  "/wiki/Natural_language_user_interface": "Natural-language user interface ( LUI or NLUI ) is a type of computer human interface where linguistic phenomena such as verbs , phrases and clauses act as UI controls for creating , selecting and modifying data in software applications . In interface design , natural-language interfaces are sought after for their speed and ease of use , but most suffer the challenges to understanding wide varieties of ambiguous input . Natural-language interfaces are an active area of study in the field of natural-language processing and computational linguistics . An intuitive general natural-language interface is one of the active goals of the Semantic Web . Text interfaces are natural to varying degrees . Many formal ( un-natural ) programming languages incorporate idioms of natural human language . Likewise , a traditional keyword search engine could be described as a shallow natural-language user interface .",

  "/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University": "The Carnegie Technical Schools were founded in 1900 in Pittsburgh by the Scottish American industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie , who wrote the time-honored words My heart is in the work , when he donated the funds to create the institution . Carnegie 's vision was to open a vocational training school for the sons and daughters of working-class Pittsburghers ( many of whom worked in his mills ) . Carnegie was inspired for the design of his school by the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn , New York founded by industrialist Charles Pratt in 1887 . In 1912 , the institution changed its name to Carnegie Institute of Technology ( CIT ) and began offering four-year degrees . During this time , CIT consisted of four constituent schools : the School of Fine and Applied Arts , the School of Apprentices and Journeymen , the School of Science and Technology , and the Margaret Morrison Carnegie School for Women . The Mellon Institute of Industrial Research was founded in 1913 by banker and industrialist brothers Andrew Mellon ( who went on to become U.S. Treasury Secretary ) and Richard B. Mellon in honor of their father , Thomas Mellon , patriarch of the Mellon family . The Institute began as a research organization which performed work for government and industry on a contract and was initially established as a department within the University of Pittsburgh . In 1927 , the Mellon Institute incorporated as an independent nonprofit . In 1937 , the Mellon Institute 's iconic building was completed and it moved to its new , and current , location on Fifth Avenue .
