  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country . [ f ] The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union . [ g ] The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years .",

  "/wiki/Wounded_Knee_Massacre": "The Wounded Knee Massacre , also called the Battle of Wounded Knee , was a domestic massacre of several hundred Lakota Indians , almost half of whom were women and children , by soldiers of the United States Army . It occurred on December 29 , 1890 , near Wounded Knee Creek ( Lakota : \u010cha\u014bkp\u00e9 \u00d3pi Wakp\u00e1la ) on the Lakota Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in the U.S. state of South Dakota , following a botched attempt to disarm the Lakota camp . The previous day , a detachment of the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment commanded by Major Samuel M. Whitside intercepted Spotted Elk 's band of Miniconjou Lakota and 38 Hunkpapa Lakota near Porcupine Butte and escorted them 5 miles ( 8.0 km ) westward to Wounded Knee Creek , where they made camp . The remainder of the 7th Cavalry Regiment , led by Colonel James W. Forsyth , arrived and surrounded the encampment . The regiment was supported by a battery of four Hotchkiss mountain guns . On the morning of December 29 , the U.S. Cavalry troops went into the camp to disarm the Lakota . One version of events claims that during the process of disarming the Lakota , a deaf tribesman named Black Coyote was reluctant to give up his rifle , claiming he had paid a lot for it . Simultaneously , an old man was performing a ritual called the Ghost Dance . Black Coyote 's rifle went off at that point , and the U.S. army began shooting at the Native Americans . The Lakota warriors fought back , but many had already been stripped of their guns and disarmed . By the time the massacre was over , between 250 and 300 men , women , and children of the Lakota had been killed and 51 were wounded ( 4 men and 47 women and children , some of whom died later ) ; some estimates placed the number of dead at 300 . Twenty-five soldiers also died , and thirty-nine were wounded ( six of the wounded later died ) .",

Approximately 70 to 80 percent of the country 's citizens identify as Turkish , while Kurds are the largest minority at anywhere from 15 to 20 percent of the population . At various points in its history , the region has been inhabited by diverse civilisations including the Assyrians , Greeks , Thracians , Phrygians , Urartians , and Armenians . Hellenization started during the era of Alexander the Great and continued into the Byzantine era . The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , and their victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 symbolises the start and foundation of Turkey .

The Legion of Merit is seventh in the order of precedence of all U.S. military awards and is worn after the Defense Superior Service Medal and before the Distinguished Flying Cross . In contemporary use in the U.S. Armed Forces , the Legion of Merit is typically awarded to Army , Marine Corps , and Air Force general officers and colonels , and Navy and Coast Guard flag officers and captains occupying senior command or very senior staff positions in their respective services . It may also be awarded to officers of lesser rank , senior warrant officers ( typically in command positions at the rank of CW5 ) , and to very senior enlisted personnel ( typically in the rank of CSM and SMA in the Army , FLTCM and MCPON in the Navy , CMSAF in the Air Force and SgtMajMC in the Marine Corps ) , but these instances are less frequent , typically by exception , and the circumstances vary by branch of service . Authority to award the Legion of Merit is reserved for general officers and flag officers in pay grade O-9 ( e.g . lieutenant general and vice admiral ) and above , civilian Department of Defense personnel at assistant service secretary or Assistant Secretary of Defense level and above , or equivalent secretary-level civilian personnel with the Department of Homeland Security with direct oversight of the U.S. Coast Guard .",
