Until 2011 , Boi had played his whole career for Cercle Brugge . Initially , his position on the field used to be side midfielder or winger . However , starting from the 2007-08 season , Cercle coach Glen De Boeck fielded Boi as right back . Ever since , De Boeck has been calling Boi the best right wing back in the Belgian competition . Boi used to be a team mate of Belgian international Thomas Buffel during his youth schooling at Cercle . It took quite a long time for Boi to definitively achieve a place in Cercle 's starting line-up , mainly because of Boi 's thin appearance during his era as a youth player . However , due to Cercle not playing at the highest level of Belgian football , Boi was eventually given an opportunity . As a result , when Cercle promoted to the highest level , Boi was physically ready to take up his responsibility as a professional footballer . Before becoming a professional player , Frederik Boi worked for the Belgian bookstore Standaard Boekhandel as a computer programmer . Frederik Boi made himself immortal for the Cercle fans , scoring the only goal in the victory against city rivals Club Brugge on 17 December 2006 .
