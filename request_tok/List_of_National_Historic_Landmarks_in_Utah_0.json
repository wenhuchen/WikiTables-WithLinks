  "/wiki/Archaeology": "Archaeology , or archeology , is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture . The archaeological record consists of artifacts , architecture , biofacts or ecofacts and cultural landscapes . Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities . In Europe it is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines , while in North America archaeology is a sub-field of anthropology . Archaeologists study human prehistory and history , from the development of the first stone tools at Lomekwi in East Africa 3.3 million years ago up until recent decades . Archaeology is distinct from palaeontology , which is the study of fossil remains . It is particularly important for learning about prehistoric societies , for whom there may be no written records to study . Prehistory includes over 99% of the human past , from the Paleolithic until the advent of literacy in societies across the world . Archaeology has various goals , which range from understanding culture history to reconstructing past lifeways to documenting and explaining changes in human societies through time . The discipline involves surveying , excavation and eventually analysis of data collected to learn more about the past . In broad scope , archaeology relies on cross-disciplinary research . It draws upon anthropology , history , art history , classics , ethnology , geography , geology , literary history , linguistics , semiology , sociology , textual criticism , physics , information sciences , chemistry , statistics , paleoecology , paleography , paleontology , paleozoology , and paleobotany .",
  "/wiki/Ancestral_Puebloans": "The Ancestral Puebloans were an ancient Native American culture that spanned the present-day Four Corners region of the United States , comprising southeastern Utah , northeastern Arizona , northwestern New Mexico , and southwestern Colorado . The Ancestral Puebloans are believed to have developed , at least in part , from the Oshara Tradition , who developed from the Picosa culture . They lived in a range of structures that included small family pit houses , larger structures to house clans , grand pueblos , and cliff-sited dwellings for defense . The Ancestral Puebloans possessed a complex network that stretched across the Colorado Plateau linking hundreds of communities and population centers . They held a distinct knowledge of celestial sciences that found form in their architecture . The kiva , a congregational space that was used chiefly for ceremonial purposes , was an integral part of this ancient people 's community structure . In contemporary times , the people and their archaeological culture were referred to as Anasazi for historical purposes . The Navajo , who were not their descendants , called them by this term , which meant ancient enemies . Contemporary Puebloans do not want this term to be used . Archaeologists continue to debate when this distinct culture emerged . The current agreement , based on terminology defined by the Pecos Classification , suggests their emergence around the 12th century BC , during the archaeologically designated Early Basketmaker II Era . Beginning with the earliest explorations and excavations , researchers identified Ancestral Puebloans as the forerunners of contemporary Pueblo peoples .",
  "/wiki/Kiva": "A kiva is a room used by Puebloans for rites and political meetings , many of them associated with the kachina belief system . Among the modern Hopi and most other Pueblo people , kivas are square-walled and underground , and are used for spiritual ceremonies . Similar subterranean rooms are found among ruins in the North-American South-West , indicating uses by the ancient peoples of the region including the ancestral Puebloans , the Mogollon , and the Hohokam . Those used by the ancient Pueblos of the Pueblo I Period and following , designated by the Pecos Classification system developed by archaeologists , were usually round and evolved from simpler pit-houses . For the Ancestral Puebloans , these rooms are believed to have had a variety of functions , including domestic residence along with social and ceremonial purposes .",

The definition of pottery used by the American Society for Testing and Materials ( ASTM ) , is all fired ceramic wares that contain clay when formed , except technical , structural , and refractory products . In archaeology , especially of ancient and prehistoric periods , pottery often means vessels only , and figures etc . of the same material are called terracottas .

The range runs from northwestern Utah County-central & eastern Tooele County , to the south shore of the Great Salt Lake . The highest elevation is Flat Top Mountain ( Utah ) at 10,620 ft ( 3,237 m ) . The name Oquirrh was taken from the Goshute word meaning wood sitting . The Oquirrh Mountains have been mined for gold , silver , lead , and most famously for copper , as home of the porphyry copper deposit at Bingham Canyon Mine , one of the world 's largest open pit mines . As seen from Salt Lake City , the view of the mountain range is dominated by the displaced rock material ( known as overburden ) dug from the Kennecott mine . At the north end of the range is Kennecott 's smelter complex which refines ore concentrates from the mine into useful metals . Dark colored tailings from past metal refining at the complex can be observed from the adjacent freeway , I-80 . The value of the minerals taken from the range has been estimated to far exceed the combined value of those taken in the California , Nevada , and Klondike gold and silver rushes . In the winter months , the mountains become home to a small population of bald eagles , which can often be found in the cliffs on the west side of the range down to the reservoir near the town of Stockton . The range has many canyons and dense forests , consisting mainly of conifers and aspen . The area is also home to thriving populations of butterflies , deer , mountain lions , and squirrels .",

  "/wiki/Open-pit_mining": "Open-pit , open-cast or open cut mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow . This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth , such as long wall mining . Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful ore or rocks are found near the surface . It is applied to ore or rocks found at the surface because the overburden is relatively thin or the material of interest is structurally unsuitable for tunnelling ( as would be the case for sand , cinder , and gravel ) . In contrast , minerals that have been found underground but are difficult to retrieve due to hard rock , can be reached using a form of underground mining . To create an open-pit mine , the miners must determine the information of the ore that is underground . This is done through drilling of probe holes in the ground , then plotting each hole location on a map . The information gained through the holes with provide an idea of the vertical extent of the ore 's body . This vertical information is then used to pit tentative locations of the benches that will occur in the mine . It is important to consider the grade and economic value of the ore in the potential pit . Open-pit mines that produce building materials and dimension stone are commonly referred to as quarries . Open-pit mines are typically enlarged until either the mineral resource is exhausted , or an increasing ratio of overburden to ore makes further mining uneconomic .",

The Bay Area 's population is ethnically diverse : for example , roughly half of the region 's residents are Hispanic , Asian , African American , or Pacific Islander , all of whom have a significant presence throughout the region . The earliest archaeological evidence of human settlements in the Bay Area dates back to 8000-10,000 BC ( from shell mounds in the Coyote Hills ) . In 1769 , the Bay Area was inhabited by the Ohlone people when a Spanish exploration party led by Gaspar de Portol\u00e0 entered the Bay - the first documented European visit to the Bay Area . After Mexico established independence from Spain in 1821 , the region was briefly controlled by the Mexican government until the United States purchased the territory in 1846 during the Mexican-American War . Soon after , discovery of gold in California attracted a flood of treasure seekers , many using ports in the Bay Area as an entry point .

[ clarification needed ] Danger cave was first investigated in the 1930s by Elmer Smith , and excavated in the 1950s under the supervision of Jesse D. Jennings , professor at the University of Utah . Jennings ' work at the site was considered ground-breaking due to his exacting standards in excavation and data analysis . Though Jenning 's findings eventually gained widespread acceptance , his publications garnered both criticism and support at first . Relating the archaeological evidence from Danger Cave to an ethnographic model , Jennings framed a view of the little-known Great Basin Desert culture which was unknown at the time . The extremely dry cave had created an ideal storage condition that preserved a variety of artifacts from beetle wings to textiles and human paleofeces . They also found leather scraps , pieces of string , nets of twine , coarse fabric , basket fragments , and bone and wood tools such as knives , weapons , and millstones . In total , excavations have produced over 2,500 chipped-stone artifacts and over 1,000 grinding stones . The excavation also yielded identifiable fragments of 68 plant species that still grow today within ten miles of the cave as well as the bones of many species of animals . The data collected from the cave suggested that the Desert Culture had a sparse population , with small social units numbering no more than 25 to 30 people . The focus on survival prevented the inhabitants from building permanent structures , developing complicated rituals , or amassing extensive personal property .",

  "/wiki/Green_River_(Colorado_River)": "The Green River , located in the western United States , is the chief tributary of the Colorado River . The watershed of the river , known as the Green River Basin , covers parts of Wyoming , Utah , and Colorado . The Green River is 730 miles ( 1,170 km ) long , beginning in the Wind River Mountains of Wyoming and flowing through Wyoming and Utah for most of its course , except for 40 miles ( 64 km ) into western Colorado . Much of the route is through the Colorado Plateau and through some of the most spectacular canyons in the United States . It is only slightly smaller than the Colorado when the two rivers merge , but typically carries a larger load of silt . The average yearly mean flow of the river at Green River , Utah is 6,121 cubic feet ( 173.3 m3 ) per second . The status of the Green River as a tributary of the Colorado River came about for mainly political reasons . In earlier nomenclature , the Colorado River began at its confluence with the Green River . Above the confluence the Colorado was called the Grand River . In 1921 , Colorado U.S. Representative Edward T. Taylor petitioned the Congressional Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce to rename the Grand River as the Colorado River . On July 25 , 1921 , the name change was made official in House Joint Resolution 460 of the 66th Congress , over the objections of representatives from Wyoming and Utah and the United States Geological Survey which noted that the drainage basin of the Green River was more extensive than that of the Grand River , although the Grand carried a higher volume of water at its confluence with the Green .",

  "/wiki/Canyon": "A canyon ( Spanish : ca\u00f1\u00f3n ; archaic British English spelling : ca\u00f1on ) or gorge is a deep cleft between escarpments or cliffs resulting from weathering and the erosive activity of a river over geologic timescales . Rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces , eventually wearing away rock layers as sediments are removed downstream . A river bed will gradually reach a baseline elevation , which is the same elevation as the body of water into which the river drains . The processes of weathering and erosion will form canyons when the river 's headwaters and estuary are at significantly different elevations , particularly through regions where softer rock layers are intermingled with harder layers more resistant to weathering . A canyon may also refer to a rift between two mountain peaks , such as those in ranges including the Rocky Mountains , the Alps , the Himalayas or the Andes . Usually a river or stream carve out such splits between mountains . Examples of mountain-type canyons are Provo Canyon in Utah or Yosemite Valley in California 's Sierra Nevada . Canyons within mountains , or gorges that have an opening on only one side , are called box canyons . Slot canyons are very narrow canyons that often have smooth walls . Steep-sided valleys in the seabed of the continental slope are referred to as submarine canyons . Unlike canyons on land , submarine canyons are thought to be formed by turbidity currents and landslides .",

It is one of only two major urban areas in the Great Basin . The world headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) is located in Salt Lake City . The city was founded in 1847 by followers of the church , led by Brigham Young , who were seeking to escape persecution that they had experienced while living farther east . The Mormon pioneers , as they would come to be known , entered an arid valley and immediately began building , planning , and extending an extensive irrigation network which could feed the population and foster future growth . Salt Lake City 's street grid system is based on a standard compass grid plan , with the Salt Lake Temple at the origin . Due to its proximity to the Great Salt Lake , the city was named Great Salt Lake City . In 1868 , the 17th Utah Territorial Legislature dropped the word Great from the city 's name .

At the time of the planning of the exodus in 1846 , the territory was owned by the Republic of Mexico , which soon after went to war with the United States over the annexation of Texas . Salt Lake Valley became American territory as a result of this war . The journey was taken by about 70,000 people beginning with advance parties sent out by church leaders in March 1846 after the 1844 martyrdom of the church 's leader Joseph Smith made it clear that the group could not remain in Nauvoo , Illinois - which the church had recently purchased , improved , renamed , and developed because of the Missouri Mormon War , setting off the Illinois Mormon War . The well-organized wagon train migration began in earnest in April 1847 , and the period ( including the flight from Missouri in 1838 to Nauvoo ) , known as the Mormon Exodus is , by convention among social scientists , traditionally assumed to have ended with the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 .

  "/wiki/Mormon_Trail": "The Mormon Trail is the 1,300-mile ( 2,092 km ) route from Illinois to Utah that members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints traveled from 1846 to 1868 . Today , the Mormon Trail is a part of the United States National Trails System , known as the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail . The Mormon Trail extends from Nauvoo , Illinois , which was the principal settlement of the Latter Day Saints from 1839 to 1846 , to Salt Lake City , Utah , which was settled by Brigham Young and his followers beginning in 1847 . From Council Bluffs , Iowa to Fort Bridger in Wyoming , the trail follows much the same route as the Oregon Trail and the California Trail ; these trails are collectively known as the Emigrant Trail . The Mormon pioneer run began in 1846 , when Young and his followers were driven from Nauvoo . After leaving , they aimed to establish a new home for the church in the Great Basin and crossed Iowa . Along their way , some were assigned to establish settlements and to plant and harvest crops for later emigrants . During the winter of 1846-47 , the emigrants wintered in Iowa , other nearby states , and the unorganized territory that later became Nebraska , with the largest group residing in Winter Quarters , Nebraska . In the spring of 1847 , Young led the vanguard company to the Salt Lake Valley , which was then outside the boundaries of the United States and later became Utah . During the first few years , the emigrants were mostly former occupants of Nauvoo who were following Young to Utah . Later , the emigrants increasingly comprised converts from the British Isles and Europe .

Mormons dedicate large amounts of time and resources to serving in their church , and many young Mormons choose to serve a full-time proselytizing mission . Mormons have a health code which eschews alcoholic beverages , tobacco , hot drinks ( tea and coffee ) , and addictive substances . They tend to be very family-oriented and have strong connections across generations and with extended family , reflective of their belief that families can be sealed together beyond death .

  "/wiki/Mountain_Meadows_massacre": "The Mountain Meadows massacre was a series of attacks on the Baker-Fancher emigrant wagon train at Mountain Meadows in southern Utah . The attacks began on September 7 and culminated on September 11 , 1857 , resulting in the mass slaughter of most in the emigrant party by members of the Utah Territorial Militia from the Iron County district , together with some Southern Paiute Native Americans . The wagon train , mostly families from Arkansas , was bound for California on a route that passed through the Utah Territory , during a time of conflict later known as the Utah War . After arriving in Salt Lake City , the Baker-Fancher party made their way south , eventually stopping to rest at Mountain Meadows . While the emigrants were camped at the meadow , nearby militia leaders , including Isaac C. Haight and John D. Lee , made plans to attack the wagon train . The militia , officially called the Nauvoo Legion , was composed of Utah 's Mormon settlers . Wanting to give the impression of tribal hostilities , their plan was to arm some Southern Paiutes and persuade the Native Americans to join with a larger party of militiamen disguised as Native Americans in an attack . During the militia 's first assault on the wagon train , the emigrants fought back , and a five-day siege ensued . Eventually fear spread among the militia 's leaders that some emigrants had caught sight of white men and had likely discovered the identity of their attackers . As a result , militia commander William H. Dame ordered his forces to kill the emigrants . By this time , the emigrants were running low on water and provisions , and allowed some members of the militia - who approached under a white flag - to enter their camp . The militia members assured the emigrants they were protected and escorted them from their hasty fortification .",

  "/wiki/Mission_66": "Mission 66 was a United States National Park Service ten-year program that was intended to dramatically expand Park Service visitor services by 1966 , in time for the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Park Service . When the National Park Service was created in 1916 , long-distance travel in North America was typically accomplished by train . There was no national road system , and airline travel was in its infancy . Railroads were closely involved in the development of visitor services at such parks as Grand Canyon National Park , Glacier National Park and Yellowstone National Park , and in many cases the railroads built and operated park visitor facilities . With the development of the US highway system as a public works project during the Great Depression , many previously remote parks became accessible via good roads and inexpensive automobiles . The explosion in prosperity following World War II brought a tide of automobile-borne tourists that the parks were ill-equipped to receive . By the mid-1950s it was apparent that massive investment in park infrastructure was required . Mission 66 was conceived as the means to accommodate increased visitor numbers and to provide high-quality interpretation services . While Mission 66 involved a variety of infrastructure projects such as roads , utilities and employee housing , the most visible components were interpretive facilities and visitor centers . Visitor centers were often the first point of contact between the Park Service and visitors , and the Park Service put considerable emphasis on the appropriate orientation and learning opportunities that visitor centers could provide .",

  "/wiki/Structural_failure": "Structural integrity and failure is an aspect of engineering which deals with the ability of a structure to support a designed structural load ( weight , force , etc . ) without breaking , and includes the study of past structural failures in order to prevent failures in future designs . Structural integrity is the ability of an item - either a structural component or a structure consisting of many components - to hold together under a load , including its own weight , without breaking or deforming excessively . It assures that the construction will perform its designed function during reasonable use , for as long as its intended life span . Items are constructed with structural integrity to prevent catastrophic failure , which can result in injuries , severe damage , death , and/or monetary losses . Structural failure refers to the loss of structural integrity , or the loss of load -carrying capacity in either a structural component , or the structure itself . Structural failure is initiated when a material is stressed beyond its strength limit , causing fracture or excessive deformations ; one limit state that must be accounted for in structural design is ultimate failure strength . In a well- designed system , a localized failure should not cause immediate or even progressive collapse of the entire structure .",

  "/wiki/Reed_Smoot_(U.S._Senator)": "Reed Smoot ( January 10 , 1862 - February 9 , 1941 ) was a businessman and apostle of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) when he was elected by the Utah state legislature to the United States Senate in 1902 ; he served as a Republican senator from 1903 to 1933 . From his time in the Senate , Smoot is primarily remembered as the co-sponsor of the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act , which increased almost 900 American import duties . Thomas Lamont , a partner at J.P. Morgan at the time said , That Act intensified nationalism all over the world . The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act is widely regarded as one of the catalysts for the Great Depression . Smoot was a prominent leader of the LDS Church , chosen to serve as an apostle in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1900 . His role in the LDS Church ( together with rumors of a secret church policy continuing polygamy and a secret oath against the United States ) led to a lengthy controversy of four years after he was elected to the Senate in 1903 . A Senate committee investigated his eligibility to serve , known as the Reed Smoot hearings , and recommended against him , but the full Senate voted to seat him . Smoot continued to be re-elected to successive terms until he lost his seat in the 1932 elections . Smoot returned to Utah in 1933 . Retiring from politics and business , he devoted himself to the church . At the time of his death , he was third in the line of succession to lead the LDS Church .",
  "/wiki/United_States_Senate": "The United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress , which , along with the United States House of Representatives - the lower chamber - constitutes the legislature of the United States . The Senate chamber is located in the north wing of the Capitol Building , in Washington , D.C . The composition and powers of the Senate are established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The Senate is composed of senators , each of whom represents a single state in its entirety . Each state , regardless of its population size , is equally represented by two senators who serve staggered terms of six years . There being at present 50 states in the Union , there are currently 100 senators . From 1789 to 1913 , senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented ; they are now elected by popular vote , following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913 . As the upper chamber of Congress , the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it . These include the approval of treaties , and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court justices , federal judges , flag officers , regulatory officials , ambassadors , other federal executive officials and other federal uniformed officers . In addition to these , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president , the duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office . Furthermore , the Senate has the responsibility of conducting the trials of those impeached by the House . The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms , smaller size , and statewide constituencies , which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere .",
  "/wiki/Protectionism": "Protectionism is the economic policy of restricting imports from other countries through methods such as tariffs on imported goods , import quotas , and a variety of other government regulations . Proponents argue that protectionist policies shield the producers , businesses , and workers of the import-competing sector in the country from foreign competitors . However , they also reduce trade and adversely affect consumers in general ( by raising the cost of imported goods ) , and harm the producers and workers in export sectors , both in the country implementing protectionist policies and in the countries protected against . There is a consensus among some economists that protectionism has a negative effect on economic growth and economic welfare , while free trade , deregulation , and the reduction of trade barriers has a significantly positive effect on economic growth . Some scholars have implicated protectionism as the cause of some economic crises , most notably the Great Depression . However , although trade liberalization can sometimes result in large and unequally distributed losses and gains , and can , in the short run , cause significant economic dislocation of workers in import-competing sectors , free trade has advantages of lowering costs of goods and services for both producers and consumers .",
  "/wiki/Smoot-Hawley_Tariff_Act": "The Tariff Act of 1930 ( codified at 19 U.S.C . ch . 4 ) , commonly known as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff or Hawley-Smoot Tariff , was a law that implemented protectionist trade policies in the United States . Sponsored by Senator Reed Smoot and Representative Willis C. Hawley , it was signed by President Herbert Hoover on June 17 , 1930 . The act raised US tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods . The tariffs under the act , excluding duty-free imports ( see Tariff levels below ) , were the second highest in United States history , exceeded by only the Tariff of 1828 . The Act and tariffs imposed by America 's trading partners in retaliation were major factors of the reduction of American exports and imports by 67% during the Depression . Economists and economic historians have a consensus view that the passage of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff exacerbated the Great Depression .",

  "/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints": "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , often informally known as the LDS Church or Mormon Church , is a nontrinitarian , Christian restorationist church that considers itself to be the restoration of the original church founded by Jesus Christ . The church is headquartered in Salt Lake City , Utah , in the United States , and has established congregations and built temples worldwide . According to the church , it has over 16 million members and 65,000 full-time volunteer missionaries . In 2012 , the National Council of Churches ranked the church as the fourth-largest Christian denomination in the United States , with over 6.5 million members there as of January 2018 . It is the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement founded by Joseph Smith during the early 19th century period of religious revival known as the Second Great Awakening . Adherents , often referred to as Latter-day Saints or , less formally , Mormons , view faith in Jesus Christ and his atonement as fundamental principles of their religion . Church theology includes the Christian doctrine of salvation only through Jesus Christ , though LDS doctrines regarding the nature of God and the potential of mankind differ significantly from mainstream Christianity . The church has an open canon which includes four scriptural texts : the Bible ( both Old and New Testaments ) , the Book of Mormon , the Doctrine and Covenants , and the Pearl of Great Price . Other than the Bible , the majority of the LDS canon constitutes revelation received by Joseph Smith and recorded by his scribes which includes commentary and exegesis about the Bible , texts described as lost parts of the Bible , and other works believed to be written by ancient prophets . Because of some of the doctrinal differences , Catholic , Orthodox , and several Protestant churches consider the church to be distinct and separate from mainstream Christianity . Under the doctrine of continuing revelation , Latter-day Saints believe that the church president is a modern-day prophet , seer , and revelator and that Jesus Christ , under the direction of God the Father , leads the church by revealing his will to its president . Individual members of the church believe that they can also receive personal revelation from God in conducting their lives .",
