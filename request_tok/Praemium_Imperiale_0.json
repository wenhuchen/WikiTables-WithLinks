  "/wiki/Painting": "Painting is the practice of applying paint , pigment , color or other medium to a solid surface ( called the matrix or support ) . The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush , but other implements , such as knives , sponges , and airbrushes , can be used . The final work is also called a painting . Painting is an important form in the visual arts , bringing in elements such as drawing , gesture ( as in gestural painting ) , composition , narration ( as in narrative art ) , or abstraction ( as in abstract art ) . Paintings can be naturalistic and representational ( as in a still life or landscape painting ) , photographic , abstract , narrative , symbolistic ( as in Symbolist art ) , emotive ( as in Expressionism ) , or political in nature ( as in Artivism ) . A portion of the history of painting in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by religious art . Examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery , to Biblical scenes Sistine Chapel ceiling , to scenes from the life of Buddha or other images of Eastern religious origin . In art , the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action . The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls , paper , canvas , wood , glass , lacquer , pottery , leaf , copper and concrete , and the painting may incorporate multiple other materials including sand , clay , paper , plaster , gold leaf , as well as objects .",
  "/wiki/Sculpture": "Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions . It is one of the plastic arts . Durable sculptural processes originally used carving ( the removal of material ) and modelling ( the addition of material , as clay ) , in stone , metal , ceramics , wood and other materials but , since Modernism , there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process . A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving , assembled by welding or modelling , or molded or cast . Sculpture in stone survives far better than works of art in perishable materials , and often represents the majority of the surviving works ( other than pottery ) from ancient cultures , though conversely traditions of sculpture in wood may have vanished almost entirely . However , most ancient sculpture was brightly painted , and this has been lost . Sculpture has been central in religious devotion in many cultures , and until recent centuries large sculptures , too expensive for private individuals to create , were usually an expression of religion or politics . Those cultures whose sculptures have survived in quantities include the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean , India and China , as well as many in Central and South America and Africa . The Western tradition of sculpture began in ancient Greece , and Greece is widely seen as producing great masterpieces in the classical period . During the Middle Ages , Gothic sculpture represented the agonies and passions of the Christian faith . The revival of classical models in the Renaissance produced famous sculptures such as Michelangelo 's David . Modernist sculpture moved away from traditional processes and the emphasis on the depiction of the human body , with the making of constructed sculpture , and the presentation of found objects as finished art works .",
  "/wiki/Architecture": "Architecture ( Latin architectura , from the Greek \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03c4\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd arkhitekton architect , from \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9- chief and \u03c4\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd creator ) is both the process and the product of planning , designing , and constructing buildings or any other structures . Architectural works , in the material form of buildings , are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art . Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements .",
  "/wiki/Music": "Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time . General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch ( which governs melody and harmony ) , rhythm ( and its associated concepts tempo , meter , and articulation ) , dynamics ( loudness and softness ) , and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture ( which are sometimes termed the color of a musical sound ) . Different styles or types of music may emphasize , de-emphasize or omit some of these elements . Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping ; there are solely instrumental pieces , solely vocal pieces ( such as songs without instrumental accompaniment ) and pieces that combine singing and instruments . The word derives from Greek \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae ( mousike ; art of the Muses ) . See glossary of musical terminology . In its most general form , the activities describing music as an art form or cultural activity include the creation of works of music ( songs , tunes , symphonies , and so on ) , the criticism of music , the study of the history of music , and the aesthetic examination of music . Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies . Common sayings such as the harmony of the spheres and it is music to my ears point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to . However , 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music , saying , for example , There is no noise , only sound . The creation , performance , significance , and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context . Indeed , throughout history , some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as not being music , including Beethoven 's Grosse Fuge string quartet in 1825 , early jazz in the beginning of the 1900s and hardcore punk in the 1980s .",
  "/wiki/Film": "Film , also called movie or motion picture or ( less widely ) The Seventh Art , is a visual art-form used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas , stories , perceptions , feelings , beauty or atmosphere , by the means of recorded or programmed [ vague ] moving images , along with sound ( and more rarely ) other sensory stimulations . The word cinema , short for cinematography , is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry , and to the art form that is the result of it . The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera , by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques , by means of CGI and computer animation , or by a combination of some or all of these techniques , and other visual effects . Traditionally , films were recorded onto celluloid film through a photochemical process and then shown through a movie projector onto a large screen . Contemporary films are often fully digital through the entire process of production , distribution , and exhibition , while films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally included an analogous optical soundtrack ( a graphic recording of the spoken words , music and other sounds that accompany the images which runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it , and is not projected ) . Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures . They reflect those cultures , and , in turn , affect them . Film is considered to be an important art form , a source of popular entertainment , and a powerful medium for educating - or indoctrinating - citizens . The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication . Some films have become popular worldwide attractions through the use of dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into other languages . The individual images that make up a film are called frames . In the projection of traditional celluloid films , a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame , in turn , is moved into position to be projected , but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision , whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after its source disappears .",
  "/wiki/Theater": "Theatre or theater [ a ] is a collaborative form of performing art that uses live performers , typically actors or actresses , to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place , often a stage . The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture , speech , song , music , and dance . Elements of art , such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality , presence and immediacy of the experience . The specific place of the performance is also named by the word theatre as derived from the Ancient Greek \u03b8\u03ad\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd ( th\u00e9atron , a place for viewing ) , itself from \u03b8\u03b5\u03ac\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 ( the\u00e1omai , to see , to watch , to observe ) . Modern Western theatre comes , in large measure , from the theatre of ancient Greece , from which it borrows technical terminology , classification into genres , and many of its themes , stock characters , and plot elements . Theatre artist Patrice Pavis defines theatricality , theatrical language , stage writing and the specificity of theatre as synonymous expressions that differentiate theatre from the other performing arts , literature and the arts in general . [ b ] Modern theatre includes performances of plays and musical theatre . The art forms of ballet and opera are also theatre and use many conventions such as acting , costumes and staging . They were influential to the development of musical theatre ; see those articles for more information .",

He worked for thirty years in Moscow , from the 1950s until the late 1980s . He now lives and works on Long Island , United States . Throughout his forty-year plus career , Kabakov has produced a wide range of paintings , drawings , installations , and theoretical texts - not to mention extensive memoirs that track his life from his childhood to the early 1980s . In recent years , he has created installations that evoked the visual culture of the Soviet Union , though this theme has never been the exclusive focus of his work . Unlike some underground Soviet artists , Kabakov joined the Union of Soviet Artists in 1959 , and became a full member in 1962 . This was a prestigious position in the USSR and it brought with it substantial material benefits . In general , Kabakov illustrated children 's books for 3-6 months each year and then spent the remainder of his time on his own projects . By using fictional biographies , many inspired by his own experiences , Kabakov has attempted to explain the birth and death of the Soviet Union , which he claims to be the first modern society to disappear . In the Soviet Union , Kabakov discovers elements common to every modern society , and in doing so he examines the rift between capitalism and communism . Rather than depict the Soviet Union as a failed Socialist project defeated by Western economics , Kabakov describes it as one utopian project among many , capitalism included . By reexamining historical narratives and perspectives , Kabakov delivers a message that every project , whether public or private , important or trivial , has the potential to fail due to the potentially authoritarian will to power .",

Reich 's work is marked by its use of repetitive figures , slow harmonic rhythm , and canons . His innovations include using tape loops to create phasing patterns , as on the early compositions It 's Gon na Rain ( 1965 ) and Come Out ( 1966 ) , and the use of simple , audible processes , as on Pendulum Music ( 1968 ) and Four Organs ( 1970 ) . The 1978 recording Music for 18 Musicians would help entrench minimalism as a movement . Reich 's work took on a darker character in the 1980s with the introduction of historical themes as well as themes from his Jewish heritage , notably Different Trains ( 1988 ) . Reich 's style of composition has influenced many contemporary composers and groups , especially in the US .

Widely noted as one of the few female monumental sculptors , de Saint Phalle was also known for her social commitment and work . She had a difficult and traumatic childhood and education , which she wrote about decades later . After an early marriage and two children , she began creating art in a na\u00efve , experimental style . She first received worldwide attention for angry , violent assemblages which had been shot by firearms . These evolved into Nanas , light-hearted , whimsical , colorful , large-scale sculptures of animals , monsters , and female figures . Her most comprehensive work was the Tarot Garden , a large sculpture garden containing numerous works ranging up to house-sized creations . Her idiosyncratic style has been called outsider art ; she had no formal training in art , but associated freely with many other contemporary artists , writers , and composers . Throughout her creative career , she collaborated with other well-known artists such as Jasper Johns , Robert Rauschenberg , Larry Rivers , composer John Cage , and architect Mario Botta , as well as dozens of less-known artists and craftspersons . For several decades , she worked especially closely with Swiss kinetic artist Jean Tinguely , who also became her second husband . In her later years , she suffered from multiple chronic health problems attributed to repeated exposure to glass fibers and petrochemical fumes from the experimental materials she had used in her pioneering artworks , but she continued to create prolifically until the end of her life . A critic has observed that Saint Phalle 's insistence on exuberance , emotion and sensuality , her pursuit of the figurative and her bold use of color have not endeared her to everyone in a minimalist age .",
