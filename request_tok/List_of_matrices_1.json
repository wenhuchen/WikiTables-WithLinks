Each such matrix , say P , represents a permutation of m elements and , when used to multiply another matrix , say A , results in permuting the rows ( when pre-multiplying , to form PA ) or columns ( when post-multiplying , to form AP ) of the matrix A .",

In other words , matrices Sn , Ln , and Un are unimodular , with Ln and Un having trace n. The elements of the symmetric Pascal matrix are the binomial coefficients , i.e .",
  "/wiki/Pascal's_triangle": "In mathematics , Pascal 's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients . In much of the Western world , it is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal , although other mathematicians studied it centuries before him in India , Persia ( Iran ) , China , Germany , and Italy . The rows of Pascal 's triangle are conventionally enumerated starting with row n = 0 at the top ( the 0th row ) . The entries in each row are numbered from the left beginning with k = 0 and are usually staggered relative to the numbers in the adjacent rows . The triangle may be constructed in the following manner : In row 0 ( the topmost row ) , there is a unique nonzero entry 1 . Each entry of each subsequent row is constructed by adding the number above and to the left with the number above and to the right , treating blank entries as 0 . For example , the initial number in the first ( or any other ) row is 1 ( the sum of 0 and 1 ) , whereas the numbers 1 and 3 in the third row are added to produce the number 4 in the fourth row .",
