It was inspired by a series of books with the same title , seen by Partridge as exploitation of children . The song was originally intended for the album Skylarking , but left off due to concerns from Partridge and Virgin Records . After college radio DJs across America picked up the song , US distributor Geffen Records recalled and re-pressed Skylarking with the track included . Partridge was dissatisfied with Dear God as he felt the lyrics were not representative of his views on religion , which was partly the reason why it was left off Skylarking . The song 's anti-religious message ultimately provoked some violent reactions . In the US , one radio station received a bomb threat , and in another incident , a student forced their school to play the song over its public-address system while holding a faculty member hostage . Partridge also received a plethora of hate mail . He stated that he felt sorry for whoever he upset , however , if you ca n't have a different opinion without them wanting to firebomb your house then that 's their problem . The music video for Dear God , one of the first to be directed by photographer Nick Brandt , received the 1987 Billboard Best Video award and was also nominated for three categories at the MTV Video Music Awards . In 2009 , the song was ranked at No . 62 on VH1 's 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the 80s , despite the fact that XTC had higher charting singles in the decade .",

  "/wiki/XTC": "XTC were an English rock band formed in Swindon in 1972 . Fronted by songwriters Andy Partridge ( guitars , vocals ) and Colin Moulding ( bass , vocals ) , the band gained popularity during the rise of punk and new wave in the 1970s , later playing in a variety of styles that ranged from angular guitar riffs to elaborately arranged pop . Partly because the group did not fit into contemporary trends , they achieved only sporadic commercial success in the UK and US , but attracted a considerable cult following . They have since been recognised for their influence on Britpop and later power pop acts . Partridge and Moulding first met in the early 1970s and subsequently formed a glam outfit with drummer Terry Chambers . The band 's name and line-up changed frequently , and it was not until 1975 that they were known as XTC . In 1977 , the group debuted on Virgin Records and , for the next five years , were noted for their energetic live performances . They aspired to be completely original and refused to play conventional punk rock , instead synthesising influences from ska , 1960s pop , dub music and the avant-garde . The single Making Plans for Nigel ( 1979 ) marked their commercial breakthrough and heralded the reverberating drum sound associated with 1980s popular music . After 1982 's English Settlement , the band stopped concert touring and became a studio-based project centred on Partridge , Moulding , and guitarist Dave Gregory . They continued to produce more progressive records , including the albums Skylarking ( produced by Todd Rundgren , 1986 ) , Oranges & Lemons ( 1989 ) , Nonsuch ( 1992 ) and Apple Venus Volume 1 ( 1999 ) . A spin-off group , the Dukes of Stratosphear , was invented as a one-off excursion into 1960s-style psychedelia , but as XTC 's music evolved , the distinctions between the two bands lessened .",

Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan ( lead vocals , guitar ) , D'arcy Wretzky ( bass ) , James Iha ( guitar ) , and Jimmy Chamberlin ( drums ) , the band has undergone many line-up changes . The current lineup features Corgan , Chamberlin , Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder . Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries , they have a diverse , densely layered , and guitar-heavy sound , containing elements of gothic rock , heavy metal , dream pop , psychedelic rock , progressive rock , shoegazing , and electronica in later recordings . Corgan is the group 's primary songwriter ; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band 's albums and songs , which have been described as anguished , bruised reports from Billy Corgan 's nightmare-land . The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album , 1993 's Siamese Dream . The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up , the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness , debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart . With 30 million albums sold worldwide , the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s . However , internal fighting , drug use , and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up . In 2006 , Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album , Zeitgeist . After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder , Chamberlin left the band in early 2009 . Later that year , Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope , which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles , compilation EP releases , and two full albums that also fell under the project 's scope - Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014 .",
