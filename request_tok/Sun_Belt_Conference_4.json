  "/wiki/College_baseball": "College baseball is baseball that is played on the intercollegiate level at institutions of higher education . In comparison to football and basketball , college competition in the United States plays a smaller role in developing professional players , as baseball 's professional minor leagues are more extensive , with a greater history of supplying players to the top professional league . Moving directly from high school to the professional level is more common in baseball than in football or basketball . However , if players do opt to enroll at a four-year college to play baseball , they must complete three years to regain professional eligibility , unless they reach age 21 before starting their third year of college . Players who enroll at junior colleges ( i.e. , two-year institutions ) regain eligibility after one year at that level . In the most recently completed 2017 season , there were 298 NCAA Division I teams in the United States ( including schools transitioning from Division II to Division I ) . As with most other U.S. intercollegiate sports , competitive college baseball is played under the auspices of either the NCAA , the NAIA , or the NJCAA . The NCAA writes the rules of play , while each sanctioning body supervises season-ending tournaments . The final rounds of the NCAA tournaments are known as the College World Series ; one is held on each of the three levels of competition sanctioned by the NCAA . The College World Series for Division I takes place in Omaha , Nebraska in June , following the regular season . The playoff bracket for Division I consists of 64 teams , with four teams playing at each of 16 regional sites ( in a double-elimination format ) . The 16 winners advance to the Super Regionals at eight sites , played head-to-head in a best-of-three series .",
  "/wiki/College_basketball": "College basketball today is governed by collegiate athletic bodies including the United States 's National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) , the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics ( NAIA ) , the United States Collegiate Athletic Association ( USCAA ) , the National Junior College Athletic Association ( NJCAA ) , and the National Christian College Athletic Association ( NCCAA ) . Governing bodies in Canada include U Sports and the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association ( CCAA ) . Each of these various organizations are subdivided into from one to three divisions based on the number and level of scholarships that may be provided to the athletes . Each organization has different conferences to divide up the teams into groups . Teams are selected into these conferences depending on the location of the schools . These conferences are put in due to the regional play of the teams and to have a structural schedule for each to team to play for the upcoming year . During conference play the teams are ranked not only through the entire NCAA , but the conference as well in which they have tournament play leading into the NCAA tournament .",
  "/wiki/Cross_country_running": "Cross country running is a sport in which teams and individuals run a race on open-air courses over natural terrain such as dirt or grass . Sometimes the runners are referred to as harriers . The course , typically 4-12 kilometres ( 2.5-7.5 mi ) long , may include surfaces of grass , and earth , pass through woodlands and open country , and include hills , flat ground and sometimes gravel road . It is both an individual and a team sport ; runners are judged on individual times and teams by a points-scoring method . Both men and women of all ages compete in cross country , which usually takes place during autumn and winter , and can include weather conditions of rain , sleet , snow or hail , and a wide range of temperatures . Cross country running is one of the disciplines under the umbrella sport of athletics , and is a natural terrain version of long-distance track and road running . Although open-air running competitions are pre-historic , the rules and traditions of cross country racing emerged in Britain . The English championship became the first national competition in 1876 and the International Cross Country Championships was held for the first time in 1903 . Since 1973 the foremost elite competition has been the IAAF World Cross Country Championships .",
  "/wiki/College_football": "College football is gridiron football consisting of American football played by teams of student athletes fielded by American universities , colleges , and military academies , or Canadian football played by teams of student athletes fielded by Canadian universities . It was through college football play that American football rules first gained popularity in the United States . Unlike most other sports in North America , no minor league farm organizations exist in American or Canadian football . Therefore , college football is generally considered to be the second tier of American football in the United States and Canadian football in Canada ; one step ahead of high school competition , and one step below professional competition . However , in some areas of the country , college football is more popular than professional football , and for much of the early 20th century , college football was seen as more prestigious than professional football . It is in college football where a player 's performance directly impacts his chances of playing professional football . The best collegiate players will typically declare for the professional draft after three to four years of collegiate competition , with the NFL holding its annual draft every spring in which 256 players are selected annually . Those not selected can still attempt to land an NFL roster spot as an undrafted free agent .",
  "/wiki/Golf": "Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible . Golf , unlike most ball games , can not and does not utilize a standardized playing area , and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game . The game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes , though recreational courses can be smaller , often having nine holes . Each hole on the course must contain a tee box to start from , and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup 4 1\u20444 inches ( 11 cm ) in diameter . There are other standard forms of terrain in between , such as the fairway , rough ( long grass ) , bunkers ( or sand traps ) , and various hazards ( water , rocks ) but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement . Golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual , known as stroke play , or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team , known as match play . Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels , but most especially at the elite level . The modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland . The 18-hole round was created at the Old Course at St Andrews in 1764 . Golf 's first major , and the world 's oldest tournament in existence , is The Open Championship , also known as the British Open , which was first played in 1860 in Ayrshire , Scotland . This is one of the four major championships in men 's professional golf , the other three being played in the United States : The Masters , the U.S. Open , and the PGA Championship .",
  "/wiki/College_soccer": "College soccer is played by teams composed of soccer players who are enrolled in colleges and universities . While it is most widespread in the United States , it is also prominent in South Korea and Canada . The institutions typically hire full-time professional coaches and staff , although the student athletes are strictly amateur and are not paid . College soccer in the United States is sponsored by the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) , the sports regulatory body for major universities , and by the governing bodies for smaller universities and colleges . This sport is played on a rectangular field of the dimensions of about 64m ( meters ) - 70m sideline to sideline ( width ) , and 100m - 110m goal line to goal line ( length ) . College soccer teams play a variety of conference and non-conference games throughout the fall season , with the season culminating in the post-season tournament called the College Cup . The St. Louis University Billikens is the most successful men 's team , having won 10 College Cups while the North Carolina Tar Heels led by head coach Anson Dorrance is the most successful women 's college soccer team with 21 College Cup wins . The best men 's and women 's college soccer player each year is awarded the Hermann Trophy . After their collegiate careers , top men 's players often go on to play professionally in Major League Soccer or other professional leagues while top women 's players may play professionally in the National Women 's Soccer League or in other professional soccer leagues around the world including Division 1 F\u00e9minine in France , Damallsvenskan in Sweden , Germany 's Frauen-Bundesliga , Australia 's W-League , or Japan 's Nadeshiko League .",
  "/wiki/College_softball": "College softball is softball as played on the intercollegiate level at institutions of higher education , predominantly in the United States . College softball is normally played by women at the Intercollegiate level , whereas college baseball is normally played by men . As with other intercollegiate sports , most college softball in the United States is played under the auspices of the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) or the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics ( NAIA ) . The NCAA writes the rules of play , while each sanctioning body supervises season-ending tournaments . The final rounds of the NCAA tournaments are known as the Women 's College World Series ( WCWS ) ; one is held on each of the three levels of competition sanctioned by the NCAA . The 2007 Women 's College World Series took place in Don E. Porter Hall of Fame Stadium in Oklahoma City near the site of the National Softball Hall of Fame in June after the regular season was over . The first NCAA Women 's College World Series was held in 1982 , while the first-ever WCWS was held in 1969 in Omaha , Nebraska ( sponsored by the Amateur Softball Association and the Division of Girls ' and Women 's Sports ) and annually thereafter . The tournament now starts with 64 teams from 16 different regions that compete in a double elimination round to start off the championship . The sixteen winners then enter a 'super regional ' , usually held at the higher seed 's home ground , for a best-of-3 series . The eight winners then enter a modified double elimination tournament to determine which team is the national champion . Instead of being a 'true ' double-elimination tournament , the tournament is split up so there are two brackets , though the losers switch brackets . The winners of each of the brackets move onto a best-of-3 championship .",
  "/wiki/Tennis": "Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent ( singles ) or between two teams of two players each ( doubles ) . Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent 's court . The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return . The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point , while the opposite player will . Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages . The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket , including wheelchair users . The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham , England , in the late 19th century as lawn tennis . It had close connections both to various field ( lawn ) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis . During most of the 19th century , in fact , the term tennis referred to real tennis , not lawn tennis . The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s . Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times , and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s . A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system , which allows a player to contest the line call of a point , a system known as Hawk-Eye .",
  "/wiki/Track_and_field": "Track and field is a sport which includes athletic contests established on the skills of running , jumping , and throwing . The name is derived from where the sport takes place , a running track and a grass field for the throwing and some of the jumping events . Track and field is categorized under the umbrella sport of athletics , which also includes road running , cross country running , and racewalking . The foot racing events , which include sprints , middle- and long-distance events , racewalking and hurdling , are won by the athlete who completes it in the least time . The jumping and throwing events are won by those who achieve the greatest distance or height . Regular jumping events include long jump , triple jump , high jump and pole vault , while the most common throwing events are shot put , javelin , discus and hammer . There are also combined events or multi events , such as the pentathlon consisting of five events , heptathlon consisting of seven events , and decathlon consisting of ten events . In these , athletes participate in a combination of track and field events . Most track and field events are individual sports with a single victor ; the most prominent team events are relay races , which typically feature teams of four . Events are almost exclusively divided by gender , although both the men 's and women 's competitions are usually held at the same venue . If a race has too many people to run all at once , preliminary heats will be run to narrow down the field of participants . Track and field is one of the oldest sports .",
  "/wiki/Volleyball": "Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net . Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team 's court under organized rules . It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964 . The complete set of rules are extensive , but play essentially proceeds as follows : a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally ' by serving the ball ( tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm ) , from behind the back boundary line of the court , over the net , and into the receiving team 's court . The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court . The team may touch the ball up to 3 times , but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively . Typically , the first two touches are used to set up for an attack , an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court . The rally continues , with each team allowed as many as three consecutive touches , until either ( 1 ) : a team makes a kill , grounding the ball on the opponent 's court and winning the rally ; or ( 2 ) : a team commits a fault and loses the rally . The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally . A few of the most common faults include :"
