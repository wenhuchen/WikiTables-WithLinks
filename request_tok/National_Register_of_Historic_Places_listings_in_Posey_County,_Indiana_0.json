  "/wiki/New_Harmony,_Indiana": "New Harmony is a historic town on the Wabash River in Harmony Township , Posey County , Indiana . It lies 15 miles ( 24 km ) north of Mount Vernon , the county seat , and is part of the Evansville metropolitan area . The town 's population was 789 at the 2010 census . Established by the Harmony Society in 1814 under the leadership of George Rapp , the town was originally known as Harmony ( also called Harmonie , or New Harmony ) . In its early years the 20,000-acre ( 8,100 ha ) settlement was the home of Lutherans who had separated from the official church in the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg and immigrated to the United States . The Harmonists built a new town in the wilderness , but in 1824 they decided to sell their property and return to Pennsylvania . Robert Owen , a Welsh industrialist and social reformer , purchased the town in 1825 with the intention of creating a new utopian community and renamed it New Harmony . While the Owenite social experiment failed two years after it began , the community made some important contributions to American society . New Harmony became known as a center for advances in education and scientific research . Town residents established the first free library , a civic drama club , and a public school system open to men and women . Its prominent citizens included Owen 's sons : Robert Dale Owen , an Indiana congressman and social reformer who sponsored legislation to create the Smithsonian Institution ; David Dale Owen , a noted state and federal geologist ; William Owen , a New Harmony businessman ; and Richard Owen , Indiana state geologist , Indiana University professor , and first president of Purdue University .

  "/wiki/James_Elliott_Farm": "The James Elliott Farm is a historic farmstead located on the edge of the town of New Harmony in Posey County , in the U.S. state of Indiana . The farm is composed of the farmhouse and seven outbuildings , including corn cribs , a barn , a shed , a silo , and a milkhouse . The farm centers around the farmhouse , which was built in the Greek Revival style in 1826 by English immigrant James Elliott ; even before Elliott joined the commune , the property had been associated with the followers of Robert Owen ; the land had previously supported an offshoot of the main community , which its residents called Feiba Peveli . Elliott had settled in the vicinity as part of the Owenist commune that lived at New Harmony at that time ; besides farming , Elliott established himself as the community 's brewer . Among the distinctive architectural elements of the farmhouse are its two large chimneys , its symmetrical five-bay facade , and a porch with a gabled Greek Revival pediment . The front door sits at the middle of the first-floor facade , with two windows on each side ; the second floor facade is similar , except that a window occupies the place of the front door . Although the Elliott Farm dates back nearly two hundred years , not all of its elements are original ; one of the outbuildings was completed in 1938 . Later in the twentieth century , the owners - still members of the Elliott family - took sustained action to restore and maintain the farm ; this was one of many projects that they undertook at the time to preserve the buildings dating back to the time of the Harmony Society . In connection with their preservation efforts , the family succeeded in having the property listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003 , due in part to the property 's importance in the fields of architecture and agriculture . Six New Harmony properties are listed on the National Register , along with many buildings that have been grouped together as the New Harmony Historic District and named a National Historic Landmark ; of the six , only the Harmony Way Bridge and the Elliott Farm are not part of the historic district .",
