  "/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)": "The Republican Party , also referred to as the GOP ( Grand Old Party ) , is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States ; the other is its historic rival , the Democratic Party . The GOP was founded in 1854 by opponents of the Kansas-Nebraska Act , which allowed for the potential expansion of slavery into certain U.S. territories . The party supported classical liberalism , opposed the expansion of slavery , and supported economic reform . Abraham Lincoln was the first Republican president . Under the leadership of Lincoln and a Republican Congress , slavery was banned in the United States in 1865 . The Party was generally dominant during the Third Party System and the Fourth Party System . After 1912 , the Party underwent an ideological shift to the right . Following the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the party 's core base shifted , with Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics . The party 's 21st-century base of support includes people living in rural areas , men , people without college degrees , the elderly , white Americans , and evangelical Christians . The 21st-century Republican Party ideology is American conservatism , which incorporates both economic policies and social values . The GOP supports lower taxes , free market capitalism , restrictions on immigration , increased military spending , gun rights , restrictions on abortion , deregulation and restrictions on labor unions . After the Supreme Court 's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade , the Republican Party opposed abortion in its party platform and grew its support among evangelicals .",
  "/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)": "The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States , along with its main rival , the Republican Party . Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 's Democratic-Republican Party , the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party . In its early years , the Party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s , the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform . Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings ; following the New Deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South . The New Deal Coalition of 1932-1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction - many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s . White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s . People living in urban areas , women , college graduates , sexual and gender minorities , millennials , and black , Latino , Jewish , Muslim and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic Party . The Democratic Party 's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality , along with the welfare state . It seeks to provide government regulation in the economy .",
  "/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election": "The 2016 United States presidential election was the 58th quadrennial presidential election , held on Tuesday , November 8 , 2016 . The Republican ticket of businessman Donald Trump and Indiana Governor Mike Pence defeated the Democratic ticket of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S . Senator from Virginia Tim Kaine , despite losing the popular vote . Trump took office as the 45th president , and Pence as the 48th vice president , on January 20 , 2017 . Trump emerged as his party 's front-runner amidst a wide field of Republican primary candidates , while Clinton defeated Senator Bernie Sanders and became the first female presidential nominee of a major American party . Trump 's populist , nationalist campaign , which promised to Make America Great Again and opposed political correctness , illegal immigration , and many free-trade agreements , garnered extensive free media coverage . Clinton emphasized her extensive political experience , denounced Trump and many of his supporters as bigots , and advocated the expansion of President Obama 's policies ; racial , LGBT , and women 's rights ; and inclusive capitalism . The tone of the general election campaign was widely characterized as divisive and negative . Trump faced controversy over his views on race and immigration , incidents of violence against protestors at his rallies , and numerous sexual misconduct allegations including a controversial tape , while Clinton 's campaign was undermined by declining approval ratings due to concerns about her ethics and trustworthiness , and an FBI investigation of her improper use of a private email server , which received more media coverage than any other topic during the campaign . Clinton led in nearly every pre-election nationwide poll and in most swing state polls , leading some commentators to compare Trump 's victory to that of Harry S. Truman in 1948 as one of the greatest political upsets in modern U.S. history . While Clinton received 2.87 million more votes than Trump did ( the largest margin ever for a losing presidential candidate ) , Trump received the majority in the Electoral College and won upset victories in the pivotal Rust Belt region . Trump won six states that Democrat Barack Obama had won in 2012 : Florida , Iowa , Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Wisconsin .",
  "/wiki/2012_United_States_presidential_election": "The 2012 United States presidential election was the 57th quadrennial presidential election , held on Tuesday , November 6 , 2012 . The Democratic nominee , President Barack Obama , and his running mate , Vice President Joe Biden , were elected to a second term . They defeated the Republican ticket of businessman and former Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin .

Romney was consistently competitive in the polls and won the support of many party leaders , but he faced challenges from a number of more conservative contenders . Romney clinched his party 's nomination in May , defeating Rick Santorum , Newt Gingrich , and several other candidates . The campaigns focused heavily on domestic issues , and debate centered largely around sound responses to the Great Recession . Other issues included long-term federal budget issues , the future of social insurance programs , and the Affordable Care Act , Obama 's marquee legislative program .

Senator from Delaware , defeated the Republican ticket of John McCain , the senior Senator from Arizona , and Sarah Palin , the Governor of Alaska . Obama became the first African American ever to be elected to the presidency . Incumbent Republican President George W. Bush was ineligible to pursue a third term due to the term limits established by the 22nd Amendment . As neither Bush nor Vice President Dick Cheney sought the presidency , the 2008 election was the first election since 1952 in which neither major party 's presidential nominee was the incumbent president or the incumbent vice president . McCain secured the Republican nomination by March 2008 , defeating Mitt Romney , Mike Huckabee , and other challengers . The Democratic primaries were marked by a sharp contest between Obama and the initial front-runner , Senator Hillary Clinton . Clinton 's victory in the New Hampshire primary made her the first woman to win a major party 's presidential primary . [ nb 1 ] After a long primary season , Obama clinched the Democratic nomination in June 2008 . Early campaigning focused heavily on the Iraq War and Bush 's unpopularity .",
  "/wiki/2004_United_States_presidential_election": "The 2004 United States presidential election was the 55th quadrennial presidential election , held on Tuesday , November 2 , 2004 . Incumbent Republican President George W. Bush defeated Democratic nominee John Kerry , a United States Senator from Massachusetts . Bush and incumbent Vice President Dick Cheney were renominated by their party with no difficulty . Former Governor Howard Dean emerged as the early front-runner in the 2004 Democratic primaries , but Kerry won the first set of primaries in January 2004 and clinched his party 's nomination in March after a series of primary victories . Kerry chose Senator John Edwards of North Carolina , who had himself sought the party 's 2004 presidential nomination , to be his running mate . Bush 's popularity had soared early in his first term after the September 11 attacks , but his popularity declined between 2001 and 2004 . Foreign policy was the dominant theme throughout the election campaign , particularly Bush 's conduct of the War on Terrorism and the aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq . Bush presented himself as a decisive leader and attacked Kerry as a flip-flopper , while Kerry criticized Bush 's conduct of the Iraq War . Domestic issues were debated as well , including the economy and jobs , health care , abortion , same-sex marriage and embryonic stem cell research . Bush won by a slim margin , taking 50.7% of the popular vote and 286 electoral votes . He swept the South and the Mountain States and took the crucial swing states of Ohio , Iowa , and New Mexico , the latter two being flipped Republican . Although Kerry flipped New Hampshire compared to the previous election , Bush 's electoral map expanded numerically .",
  "/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election": "The 2000 United States presidential election was the 54th quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday , November 7 , 2000 . Republican candidate George W. Bush , the governor of Texas and eldest son of the 41st president , George H. W. Bush , won the election , defeating Democratic nominee Al Gore , the incumbent vice president . It was the fourth of five presidential elections in which the winning candidate lost the popular vote , and is considered one of the closest elections in US history . Gore secured the Democratic nomination with relative ease , defeating a challenge by former Senator Bill Bradley . Bush was seen as the early favorite for the Republican nomination and , despite a contentious primary battle with Senator John McCain and others , secured the nomination by Super Tuesday . Bush chose former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney as his running mate , while Gore chose Senator Joe Lieberman . The left-wing Green Party nominated political activists Ralph Nader and Winona LaDuke . Both major-party candidates focused primarily on domestic issues , such as the budget , tax relief , and reforms for federal social insurance programs , although foreign policy was not ignored . Due to President Bill Clinton 's sex scandal with Monica Lewinsky and subsequent impeachment , Gore avoided campaigning with Clinton . Republicans denounced Clinton 's indiscretions , while Gore criticized Bush 's lack of experience . On election night , it was unclear who had won , with the electoral votes of the state of Florida still undecided .",
  "/wiki/1996_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1996 United States presidential election was the 53rd quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday , November 5 , 1996 . Incumbent Democratic President Bill Clinton defeated former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole , the Republican nominee , and Ross Perot , the Reform Party nominee . Clinton and Vice President Al Gore were re-nominated without incident by the Democratic Party . Numerous candidates entered the 1996 Republican primaries , with Dole considered the early front-runner . Dole clinched the nomination after defeating challenges by publisher Steve Forbes and paleoconservative leader Pat Buchanan . Dole 's running mate was Jack Kemp , a former Congressman and football player who had served as the Housing Secretary under President George H. W. Bush . Ross Perot , who had won 18.9% of the popular vote as an independent candidate in the 1992 election , ran as the candidate of the Reform Party . Perot received less media attention in 1996 and was excluded from the presidential debates . Clinton 's chances of winning were initially considered slim in the middle of his term as his party had lost both the House of Representatives and the Senate in 1994 for the first time in decades . He was able to regain ground as the economy began to recover from the early 1990s recession with a relatively stable world stage . Clinton tied Dole to Newt Gingrich , the unpopular Republican Speaker of the House .",
  "/wiki/1992_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1992 United States presidential election was the 52nd quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday , November 3 , 1992 . Democratic Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas defeated incumbent Republican President George H. W. Bush , independent businessman Ross Perot of Texas , and a number of minor candidates . Bush had alienated many of the conservatives in his party by breaking his 1988 campaign pledge against raising taxes , but he fended off a primary challenge from conservative commentator Pat Buchanan . Bush 's popularity after his success in the Gulf War dissuaded high-profile Democratic candidates like Mario Cuomo from entering the 1992 Democratic primaries . Clinton , a leader of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council , established himself as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination by sweeping the Super Tuesday primaries . He defeated former and future Governor of California Jerry Brown , former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas , and other candidates to win his party 's nomination , and chose Senator Al Gore as his running mate . Billionaire Ross Perot launched an independent campaign , emphasizing his opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement and his plan to reduce the national debt . The economy was in recession and Bush 's greatest strength , foreign policy , was regarded as much less important following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War and the relatively peaceful climate in the Middle East after the Gulf War . Perot led in several polls taken in June 1992 , but severely damaged his candidacy by temporarily dropping out of the race in July . The Bush campaign criticized Clinton 's character and emphasized Bush 's foreign policy successes , while Clinton focused on the economy . Clinton won a plurality in the popular vote and a majority of the electoral vote , breaking a streak of three straight Republican victories .",
  "/wiki/1988_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1988 United States presidential election was the 51st quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday , November 8 , 1988 . Incumbent Vice President George H. W. Bush , the Republican nominee , defeated Democratic Governor Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts . The 1988 election is the only election since 1948 in which either major party won a third straight presidential election . Incumbent President Ronald Reagan was ineligible to seek a third term , due to term limits established by the 22nd Amendment to the United States Constitution . Bush entered the 1988 Republican primaries as the front-runner . He defeated Senator Bob Dole and televangelist Pat Robertson to win the nomination , and selected Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana as his running mate . Dukakis won the 1988 Democratic primaries after Democratic leaders such as Gary Hart and Ted Kennedy withdrew or declined to run . He selected Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas - who had defeated Bush in a U.S. Senate race 18 years earlier - as his running mate . Running an aggressive campaign , Bush concentrated on the economy and continuing Reagan 's policies . He attacked Dukakis as an elitist Massachusetts liberal , and Dukakis appeared to fail to respond effectively to Bush 's criticism . Despite Dukakis 's initial lead , Bush pulled ahead in opinion polling conducted in September and won by a substantial margin in both the popular and electoral vote .",
  "/wiki/1984_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1984 United States presidential election was the 50th quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday , November 6 , 1984 . Incumbent Republican President Ronald Reagan defeated former Vice President Walter Mondale , the Democratic candidate . Reagan faced only token opposition in his bid for re-nomination by the Republicans , so he and Vice President George H. W. Bush were easily re-nominated . Mondale defeated activist Jesse Jackson and several other candidates in the 1984 Democratic primaries before eventually choosing U.S. Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York as his running mate , the first woman to be on a major party 's presidential ticket . Reagan touted a strong economic recovery from the 1970s stagflation and the 1981-82 recession , as well as the widespread perception that his presidency had overseen a revival of national confidence and prestige . The Reagan campaign produced effective television advertising and deftly neutralized concerns regarding Reagan 's age . Mondale criticized Reagan 's supply-side economic policies and budget deficits , and he called for a nuclear freeze and ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment . Reagan won 58.8% of the popular vote and carried 49 of the 50 states , becoming the oldest person to win a presidential election . Reagan 's showing ranks fifth in the share of electoral votes received and fifth in the share of the popular vote won . No candidate since 1984 has equaled Reagan 's share of the electoral vote , although his popular vote was eventually surpassed by Bush in 2004 ( 62 million ) and subsequent candidates . Mondale received 40.6% of the popular vote , but carried only the District of Columbia and his home state of Minnesota .",
  "/wiki/1980_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1980 United States presidential election was the 49th quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday , November 4 , 1980 . Republican nominee Ronald Reagan defeated Democrat Jimmy Carter . Due to the rise of conservatism following Reagan 's victory , some historians consider the election to be a realigning election that marked the start of the Reagan Era . Carter 's unpopularity and poor relations with Democratic leaders encouraged an intra-party challenge by Senator Ted Kennedy , a younger brother of former President John F. Kennedy . Carter defeated Kennedy in the majority of the Democratic primaries , but Kennedy remained in the race until Carter was officially nominated at the 1980 Democratic National Convention . The Republican primaries were contested between Reagan , who had previously served as the Governor of California , former Congressman George H. W. Bush of Texas , Congressman John B. Anderson of Illinois , and several other candidates . All of Reagan 's opponents had dropped out by the end of the primaries , and the 1980 Republican National Convention nominated a ticket consisting of Reagan and Bush . Anderson entered the race as an independent candidate , and convinced former Wisconsin Governor Patrick Lucey , a Democrat , to serve as his running mate . Reagan campaigned for increased defense spending , implementation of supply-side economic policies , and a balanced budget . His campaign was aided by Democratic dissatisfaction with Carter , the Iran hostage crisis , and a worsening economy at home marked by high unemployment and inflation . Carter attacked Reagan as a dangerous right-wing extremist and warned that Reagan would cut Medicare and Social Security .",
  "/wiki/1976_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1976 United States presidential election was the 48th quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday , November 2 , 1976 . Democrat Jimmy Carter of Georgia defeated incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford from Michigan . Carter 's win represented the lone Democratic victory in a presidential election held between 1968 and 1992 . President Richard Nixon had won the 1972 election with Spiro Agnew as his running mate , but in 1973 Agnew resigned and Ford was appointed as vice president via the 25th Amendment . When Nixon resigned in 1974 in the wake of the Watergate scandal , Ford ascended to the presidency , becoming the only president to have never been elected to national office . He faced a strong challenge from conservative former governor and future president Ronald Reagan of California in the Republican primaries , but Ford narrowly prevailed at the convention . Carter was little-known at the start of the Democratic primaries , but the former governor of Georgia emerged as the front-runner after his victories in the first set of primaries . Campaigning as a political moderate and Washington outsider , Carter defeated opponents such as Jerry Brown and Mo Udall to clinch the Democratic nomination . Ford pursued a Rose Garden strategy in which he sought to portray himself as an experienced leader focused on fulfilling his role as chief executive . Carter emphasized his status as a reformer who was untainted by Washington . Saddled with a poor economy , the fall of South Vietnam and his unpopular pardon of Nixon , Ford trailed by a wide margin in polls taken after Carter 's formal nomination in July 1976 .",
  "/wiki/1972_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1972 United States presidential election was the 47th quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday , November 7 , 1972 . Incumbent Republican President Richard Nixon from California defeated Democratic U.S . Senator George McGovern of South Dakota . Until 1984 , this was the largest margin of victory in the Electoral College in a U.S. presidential election . Nixon easily swept aside challenges from two Republican congressmen in the 1972 Republican primaries to win re-nomination . McGovern , who had played a significant role in reforming the Democratic nomination system after the 1968 election , mobilized the anti-war movement and other liberal supporters to win his party 's nomination . Among the candidates he defeated were early front-runner Edmund Muskie , 1968 nominee Hubert Humphrey , and Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm , the first African-American to run for a major party 's presidential nomination . Nixon emphasized the strong economy and his success in foreign affairs , while McGovern ran on a platform calling for an immediate end to the Vietnam War , and the institution of a guaranteed minimum income . Nixon maintained a large and consistent lead in polling . Separately , Nixon 's reelection committee broke into the Watergate complex to wiretap the Democratic National Committee 's headquarters , a scandal that would later be known as Watergate . McGovern 's campaign was further damaged by the revelation that his running mate , Thomas Eagleton , had undergone psychiatric electroshock therapy as a treatment for depression .",
  "/wiki/1968_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1968 United States presidential election was the 46th quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday , November 5 , 1968 . The Republican nominee , former Vice President Richard Nixon , defeated the Democratic nominee , incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey . Analysts have argued the election of 1968 was a major realigning election as it permanently disrupted the New Deal Coalition that had dominated presidential politics for 36 years . Incumbent Democratic United States President Lyndon B. Johnson had been the early front-runner for his party 's nomination , but he announced his withdrawal from the race after anti-Vietnam War candidate United States Senator Eugene McCarthy finished second in the New Hampshire primary . McCarthy , former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy , and Vice President Hubert Humphrey emerged as the three major candidates in the Democratic primaries until Kennedy was assassinated on June 5 , 1968 at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles , California . Humphrey won the presidential nomination at the 1968 Democratic National Convention , which saw numerous anti-war protests . Nixon entered the 1968 Republican primaries as the front-runner , and he defeated Nelson Rockefeller , Ronald Reagan , and other candidates at the 1968 Republican National Convention to win his party 's nomination . Governor George Wallace of Alabama ran on the American Independent Party ticket , campaigning in favor of racial segregation . The election year was tumultuous ; it was marked by the assassination of Civil Rights Movement leader Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4 , 1968 in Memphis , Tennessee , subsequent King assassination riots across the nation , the assassination of Kennedy , and widespread opposition to the Vietnam War across university campuses . Nixon ran on a campaign that promised to restore law and order to the nation 's cities and provide new leadership in the Vietnam War . A year later , he would popularize the term silent majority to describe those he viewed as being his target voters .",
  "/wiki/1964_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1964 United States presidential election was the 45th quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday , November 3 , 1964 . Incumbent Democratic United States President Lyndon B. Johnson defeated Barry Goldwater , the Republican nominee . With 61.1% of the popular vote , Johnson won the largest share of the popular vote of any candidate since the largely uncontested 1820 election . Johnson took office on November 22 , 1963 , following the assassination of his predecessor , John F. Kennedy . He easily defeated a primary challenge by segregationist Governor George Wallace of Alabama to win nomination to a full term . At the 1964 Democratic National Convention , Johnson also won the nomination of his preferred running mate , United States Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota . United States Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona , a leader of his party 's conservative faction , defeated moderate Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York and Governor William Scranton of Pennsylvania at the 1964 Republican National Convention . Johnson championed his passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , and his campaign advocated a series of anti-poverty programs collectively known as the Great Society . Goldwater espoused a low-tax , small government philosophy , and opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . Democrats successfully portrayed Goldwater as a dangerous extremist , most famously in the Daisy television advertisement . The Republican Party was divided between its moderate and conservative factions , with Rockefeller and other moderate party leaders refusing to campaign for Goldwater .",
  "/wiki/1960_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1960 United States presidential election was the 44th quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday , November 8 , 1960 . In a closely contested election , Democrat United States Senator John F. Kennedy defeated incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon , the Republican Party nominee . This was the first election in which fifty states participated and the last in which the District of Columbia did not . It was the first election in which an incumbent president was ineligible to run for a third term because of the term limits established by the 22nd Amendment . It is also the last election where the losing candidate won Ohio . Nixon faced little opposition in the Republican race to succeed popular incumbent Dwight D. Eisenhower . Kennedy , a U.S . Senator from Massachusetts , established himself as the Democratic front-runner with his strong performance in the 1960 Democratic primaries , including a key victory in West Virginia over United States Senator Hubert Humphrey . He defeated Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson on the first presidential ballot of the 1960 Democratic National Convention , and asked Johnson to serve as his running mate . The issue of the Cold War dominated the election , as tensions were high between the United States and the Soviet Union . Kennedy won a 303 to 219 Electoral College victory and is generally considered to have won the national popular vote by 112,827 , a margin of 0.17 percent , though some argue that Nixon should be credited with the popular vote victory , as the issue of the popular vote was complicated by the presence of several unpledged electors in the Deep South ."
