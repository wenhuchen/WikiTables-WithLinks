Rome also serves as the capital of the Lazio region . With 2,879,728 residents in 1,285 km2 ( 496.1 sq mi ) , it is also the country 's most populated comune . It is the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits . It is the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome , which has a population of 4,355,725 residents , thus making it the second or third most populous metropolitan city in Italy depending on definition . Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula , within Lazio ( Latium ) , along the shores of the Tiber . Vatican City ( the smallest country in the world ) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome , the only existing example of a country within a city ; for this reason Rome has sometimes been defined as the capital of two states . Rome 's history spans 28 centuries . While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC , the site has been inhabited for much longer , making it one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe . The city 's early population originated from a mix of Latins , Etruscans , and Sabines . Eventually , the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom , the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire , and is regarded by many as the first ever Imperial City and metropolis . It was first called The Eternal City ( Latin : Urbs Aeterna ; Italian : La Citt\u00e0 Eterna ) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC , and the expression was also taken up by Ovid , Virgil , and Livy .",

  "/wiki/Cannons_(house)": "Cannons was a stately home in Little Stanmore , Middlesex , England .

The house was razed in 1747 and its contents dispersed . The name Cannons is an obsolete spelling of canons and refers to the Augustinian canons of St Bartholomew 's Hospital , London , which owned the estate before the English Reformation . Cannons was the focus of the first Duke 's artistic patronage - patronage which led to his nickname The Apollo of the Arts . Brydges filled Cannons with Old Masters and Grand Tour acquisitions , and also appointed Handel as resident house composer from 1717 to 1718 . Such was the fame of Cannons that members of the public flocked to visit the estate in great numbers and Alexander Pope was unjustly accused of having represented the house as Timon 's Villa in his Epistle Of Taste ( 1731 ) . The Cannons estate was acquired by Chandos in 1713 from the uncle of his first wife , Mary Lake . Mary 's great-grandfather Sir Thomas Lake had acquired the manor of Great Stanmore in 1604 . Following the first Duke 's death in 1744 , Cannons passed to his son Henry Brydges , 2nd Duke of Chandos . Due to the cost of building Cannons and significant losses to the family fortune in the South Sea Bubble there was little liquid capital in Henry 's inheritance , so in 1747 he held a twelve-day demolition sale at Cannons which saw both the contents and the very structure of the house itself sold piecemeal leaving little more than a ruin barely thirty years after its inception . The subsequent villa built by William Hallett is now occupied by North London Collegiate School .",

  "/wiki/Alexander_Pope": "Alexander Pope ( 21 May 1688 - 30 May 1744 ) is regarded as one of the greatest English poets , and the foremost poet of the early eighteenth century . He is best known for his satirical and discursive poetry , including The Rape of the Lock , The Dunciad , and An Essay on Criticism , as well as for his translation of Homer . After Shakespeare , Pope is the second-most quoted writer in the English language , as per The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations , some of his verses having even become popular idioms in common parlance ( e.g. , Damning with faint praise ) . He is considered a master of the heroic couplet . Pope 's poetic career testifies to his indomitable spirit in the face of disadvantages , of health and of circumstance . The poet and his family were Catholics and thus fell subject to the Test Acts , prohibitive measures which severely hampered the prosperity of their co-religionists after the abdication of James II ; one of these banned them from living within ten miles of London , and another from attending public school or university . For this reason , except for a few spurious Catholic schools , Pope was largely self-educated . He was taught to read by his aunt and became a lover of books . He learned French , Italian , Latin , and Greek by himself , and discovered Homer at the age of six . As a child Pope survived being once trampled by a cow , but when he was 12 began struggling with tuberculosis of the spine ( Pott disease ) , along with fits of crippling headaches which troubled him throughout his life . In the year 1709 , Pope showcased his precocious metrical skill with the publication of Pastorals , his first major poems . They earned him instant fame .",
  "/wiki/Her_Majesty's_Theatre": "Her Majesty 's Theatre is a West End theatre situated on Haymarket in the City of Westminster , London . The present building was designed by Charles J. Phipps and was constructed in 1897 for actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree , who established the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art at the theatre . In the early decades of the 20th century , Tree produced spectacular productions of Shakespeare and other classical works , and the theatre hosted premieres by major playwrights such as George Bernard Shaw , J. M. Synge , No\u00ebl Coward and J . B. Priestley . Since the First World War , the wide stage has made the theatre suitable for large-scale musical productions , and the theatre has accordingly specialised in hosting musicals . The theatre has been home to record-setting musical theatre runs , notably the First World War sensation Chu Chin Chow and the current production , Andrew Lloyd Webber 's The Phantom of the Opera , which has played continuously at Her Majesty 's since 1986 . The theatre was established by architect and playwright John Vanbrugh , in 1705 , as the Queen 's Theatre . Legitimate drama unaccompanied by music was prohibited by law in all but the two London patent theatres , and so this theatre quickly became an opera house . Between 1711 and 1739 , more than 25 operas by George Frideric Handel premiered here . Joseph Haydns series of concerts in London took place here in the 1790s . In the early 19th century , the theatre hosted the opera company that was to move to the Theatre Royal , Covent Garden , in 1847 , and presented the first London performances of Mozart 's La clemenza di Tito , Cos\u00ec fan tutte and Don Giovanni .

Racine was primarily a tragedian , producing such examples of neoclassical perfection as Ph\u00e8dre , Andromaque , and Athalie . He did write one comedy , Les Plaideurs , and a muted tragedy , Esther for the young . Racine 's plays displayed his mastery of the dodecasyllabic ( 12 syllable ) French alexandrine . His writing is renowned for its elegance , purity , speed , and fury , and for what American poet Robert Lowell described as a diamond-edge , and the glory of its hard , electric rage . Racine 's dramaturgy is marked by his psychological insight , the prevailing passion of his characters , and the nakedness [ clarification needed ] of both plot and stage . The linguistic effects of Racine 's poetry are widely considered to be untranslatable , although many eminent poets have attempted to translate Racine 's work into English , including Lowell , Richard Wilbur , Ted Hughes , Tony Harrison , and Derek Mahon , and Friedrich Schiller into German . The latest translations of Racine 's plays into English have been by Alan Hollinghurst ( Berenice , Bajazet ) , by RADA director Edward Kemp ( Andromache ) , Neil Bartlett , and poet Geoffrey Alan Argent , who earned a 2011 American Book Award for the translating The Complete Plays of Jean Racine .",

The work , which Handel composed in 1738 , includes the famous Dead March , a funeral anthem for Saul and his son Jonathan , and some of the composer 's most dramatic choral pieces . Saul was first performed at the King 's Theatre in London on 16 January 1739 . The work was a success at its London premiere and was revived by Handel in subsequent seasons .

Handel started it soon after the opera season at King 's Theatre was cancelled for lack of subscribers . The oratorio was not well received by the first audience though commended in the Daily Post ; the second performance was shortened , the mainly choral work now augmented with Italian-style arias . The first version of the piece is in three parts rather than two , the first part more famous as The ways of Zion do mourn , with altered text as The sons of Israel do mourn lamenting the death of Joseph .

The original plan for laying out and planting these fields , drawn by the hand of Inigo Jones , was said still to be seen in Lord Pembroke 's collection at Wilton House in the 19th century , but is untraced . The grounds , which had remained private property , were acquired by London County Council in 1895 .

  "/wiki/John_Milton": "John Milton ( 9 December 1608 - 8 November 1674 ) was an English poet and intellectual , who served as a civil servant for the Commonwealth of England under its Council of State and later under Oliver Cromwell . He wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval , and is best known for his epic poem Paradise Lost ( 1667 ) , written in blank verse , widely considered to be one of the greatest works of literature ever written . Writing in English , Latin , Greek , and Italian , he achieved international renown within his lifetime , and his celebrated Areopagitica ( 1644 ) , written in condemnation of pre-publication censorship , is among history 's most influential and impassioned defences of freedom of speech and freedom of the press . His desire for freedom extended into his style : he introduced new words ( coined from Latin ) to the English language , and was the first modern writer to employ unrhymed verse outside of the theatre or translations . William Hayley 's 1796 biography called him the greatest English author , and he remains generally regarded as one of the preeminent writers in the English language , though critical reception has oscillated in the centuries since his death ( often on account of his republicanism ) . Samuel Johnson praised Paradise Lost as a poem which.with respect to design may claim the first place , and with respect to performance , the second , among the productions of the human mind , though he ( a Tory and recipient of royal patronage ) described Milton 's politics as those of an acrimonious and surly republican .

  "/wiki/Messiah_(Handel)": "Messiah ( HWV 56 ) [ n 1 ] is an English-language oratorio composed in 1741 by George Frideric Handel , with a scriptural text compiled by Charles Jennens from the King James Bible , and from the Coverdale Psalter , the version of the Psalms included with the Book of Common Prayer . It was first performed in Dublin on 13 April 1742 and received its London premiere nearly a year later . After an initially modest public reception , the oratorio gained in popularity , eventually becoming one of the best-known and most frequently performed choral works in Western music . Handel 's reputation in England , where he had lived since 1712 , had been established through his compositions of Italian opera . He turned to English oratorio in the 1730s in response to changes in public taste ; Messiah was his sixth work in this genre . Although its structure resembles that of opera , it is not in dramatic form ; there are no impersonations of characters and no direct speech . Instead , Jennens 's text is an extended reflection on Jesus as the Messiah called Christ . The text begins in Part I with prophecies by Isaiah and others , and moves to the annunciation to the shepherds , the only scene taken from the Gospels . In Part II , Handel concentrates on the Passion and ends with the Hallelujah chorus . In Part III he covers the resurrection of the dead and Christ 's glorification in heaven . Handel wrote Messiah for modest vocal and instrumental forces , with optional settings for many of the individual numbers . In the years after his death , the work was adapted for performance on a much larger scale , with giant orchestras and choirs .",

However it was not what London audiences were expecting of an oratorio during the solemn season of Lent- Semele has a secular text with a story involving an adulterous sexual relationship . It is distinguished from Handel 's operas by the large number of polyphonic choruses .

  "/wiki/Belshazzar_(Handel)": "Belshazzar ( HWV 61 ) is an oratorio by George Frideric Handel . The libretto was by Charles Jennens , and Handel abridged it considerably . Jennens ' libretto was based on the Biblical account of the fall of Babylon at the hands of Cyrus the Great and the subsequent freeing of the Jewish nation , as found in the Book of Daniel . Handel composed Belshazzar in the late Summer of 1744 concurrently with Hercules , during a time that Winton Dean calls the peak of Handel 's creative life . The work premiered the following Lenten season on 27 March 1745 at the King 's Theatre , London . The work fell into neglect after Handel 's death , with revivals of the work occurring in the United Kingdom in 1847 , 1848 and 1873 . With the revival of interest in Baroque music and historically informed musical performance since the 1960s , Belsahzzar receives performances in concert form today and is also sometimes fully staged as an opera . Among other performances , Belshazzar was staged at the Aix-en-Provence Festival in 2008 and by the Zurich Opera in 2019 .",
  "/wiki/Occasional_Oratorio": "An Occasional Oratorio ( HWV 62 ) is an oratorio by George Frideric Handel , based upon a libretto by Newburgh Hamilton after the poetry of John Milton and Edmund Spenser . The work was written in the midst of the Jacobite rising of 1745-1746 , the attempt to overthrow Handel 's patrons the Hanoverian monarchy under George II and replace them with a Stuart restoration under Charles Edward Stuart , Bonnie Prince Charlie . The Occasional Oratorio is unique among Handel 's works which he labelled oratorio in that it does not tell a story or contain elements of a drama , but was intended as a defiant and patriotic rallying piece . The Stuart armies , based in Scotland , had invaded England and got as far as Derby when the King 's armies under the command of the King 's son Prince William , Duke of Cumberland had driven them back to Scotland in December 1745 . The fighting was at a hiatus due to winter weather and the Duke of Cumberland was in London in February 1746 . Handel composed the Occasional Oratorio hastily in January and February 1746 , borrowing and re-arranging some movements from previous compositions , and premiered it immediately on 14 February 1746 with Willem de Fesch , \u00c9lisabeth Duparc , Elisabetta de Gambarini , John Beard ( tenor ) , and Thomas Reinhold at Covent Garden Theatre . It contains 44 movements split over three parts . Part One , generally speaking , concerns the miseries of war and the vengeance of a wrathful God , Part Two the blessings of peace , and Part Three a thanksgiving for victory . This was felt at the time by some to be premature as the rebels had not yet been defeated , Charles Jennens , Handel 's friend and collaborator who wrote the text for Saul and others of Handel 's oratorios called the piece a triumph for a victory not yet gained . The festive four part overture , with trumpets and drums , is sometimes performed outside the context of the entire piece . The famous chorus Prepare the Hymn ( a paraphrase of Psalm 81:1-2 ) is the 26th movement and appears in the second part . The second minuet from the Music for the Royal Fireworks was reused from this oratorio .",
  "/wiki/Judas_Maccabaeus_(Handel)": "Judas Maccabaeus ( HWV 63 ) is an oratorio in three acts composed in 1746 by George Frideric Handel based on a libretto written by Thomas Morell . The oratorio was devised as a compliment to the victorious Prince William Augustus , Duke of Cumberland upon his return from the Battle of Culloden ( 16 April 1746 ) . Other catalogues of Handel 's music have referred to the work as HG xxii ; and HHA 1/24 .",
  "/wiki/Thomas_Morell": "Thomas Morell ( /m\u0254\u02d0\u02c8r\u025bl/ ; 18 March 1703 - 19 February 1784 ) was an English librettist , classical scholar , and printer .",
  "/wiki/Joshua_(Handel)": "Joshua ( HWV 64 ) is an oratorio by George Frideric Handel . It was composed in a month , between 19 July 1747 and 19 August 1747 , six months before the beginning of the oratorio season , and is Handel 's fourth oratorio based on a libretto by Thomas Morell . The oratorio premiered on 9 March 1748 at the Covent Garden Theatre , London . Joshua is based on the Biblical story of Joshua as the leader of the Children of Israel . The story follows the Israelites from their passage over the Jordan River into Caanan and through the Battle of Jericho . The work also includes a love story elaborated from a few hints in the Biblical narrative between Achsah , Caleb 's daughter and Othniel , a young soldier . Joshua was the fourth oratorio Handel had written within the span of twenty months . Following the Jacobite rising of 1745 in England , Handel produced a series of English oratorios based on military themes : Occasional Oratorio , Judas Maccabaeus , Alexander Balus , Joshua , and Solomon . The military conquests the Israelites achieve in the oratorio were seen as parallels to the victory of the Hanoverian regime in crushing the Jacobite rebellion . Joshua was one of his shortest oratorios , containing no genuine overture , only a brief orchestral movement simply titled , Introduction . Joshua also included at least five pieces borrowed from other Handel compositions . Part one was completed on 30 July 1747 , Part two on 8 August and Part three on 19 August ."
