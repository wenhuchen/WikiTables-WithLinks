Magdalene counted some of the greatest men in the realm among its benefactors , including Britain 's premier noble the Duke of Norfolk , the Duke of Buckingham and Lord Chief Justice Christopher Wray . Thomas Audley , Lord Chancellor under Henry VIII , was responsible for the refoundation of the college and also established its motto - garde ta foy ( Old French : keep your faith ) . Audley 's successors in the Mastership and as benefactors of the College were , however , prone to dire ends ; several benefactors were arraigned at various stages on charges of high treason and executed . The college 's most famous alumnus is the 17th-century chronicler Samuel Pepys . His papers and books were donated to the college upon his death and are housed in the Pepys Library in the Pepys Building . A portrait of the diarist by Peter Lely hangs in the Hall . Magdalene is noted for its 'traditional ' style : it boasts a well-regarded candlelit formal hall ( held every evening ) and was the last all-male college in Oxford or Cambridge to admit women in 1988 ( Oriel College was the last in Oxford , admitting women in 1986 ) . This change resulted in protests by some male undergraduates , including the wearing of black armbands and flying the college flag at half-mast .

He was the 104th Archbishop of Canterbury , a position he held from December 2002 to December 2012 . Previously the Bishop of Monmouth and Archbishop of Wales , Williams was the first Archbishop of Canterbury in modern times not to be appointed from within the Church of England . Williams ' primacy was marked by speculation that the Anglican Communion ( in which the Archbishop of Canterbury is the leading figure ) was on the verge of fragmentation over disagreements on contemporary issues such as homosexuality and the ordination of women . Williams worked to keep all sides talking to one another . Notable events during his time as Archbishop of Canterbury include the rejection by a majority of dioceses of his proposed Anglican Covenant and , in the final General Synod of his tenure , his unsuccessful attempt to secure a sufficient majority for a measure to allow the appointment of women as bishops in the Church of England . Having spent much of his earlier career as an academic at the universities of Cambridge and Oxford successively , Williams speaks three languages and reads at least nine . After standing down as Archbishop , Williams took up the positions of Master of Magdalene College , Cambridge , in 2013 , and Chancellor of the University of South Wales in 2014 . He also delivered the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh in 2013 . Justin Welby succeeded Williams as Archbishop of Canterbury on 9 November 2012 , being enthroned in March 2013 .
