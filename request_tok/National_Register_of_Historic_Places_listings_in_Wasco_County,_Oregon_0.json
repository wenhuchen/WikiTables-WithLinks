This well-preserved set of 1890s Swedish American vernacular architecture was originally located on a farm on Pleasant Ridge , south of The Dalles . Lewis Anderson was a Swedish immigrant who , after establishing himself on Pleasant Ridge , worked semi-successfully to encourage further Swedish settlement in the area of The Dalles . The sidehill barn , with grade entrances on two levels , was the first erected of the ensemble , in 1890 . The house was built by Anderson and fellow Swedish immigrant Ab Pearson in 1895 . Anderson purchased and relocated the granary from a neighboring farm in 1898 , in the process repurposing it from its previous function as a house . The buildings were relocated to The Dalles in 1972 in order to restore and protect them , and were made part of the Fort Dalles Museum at that time . They were entered onto the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 .",

  "/wiki/Swedish_American": "Swedish Americans ( Swedish : Svenskamerikaner ) are Americans of at least partial Swedish ancestry . They primarily include the 1.2 million Swedish immigrants during 1885-1915 and their descendants . They formed tight-knit communities , primarily in the American Midwest , and intermarried with other Swedish-Americans . Most were Lutheran Christians with origins in the state Church of Sweden who were affiliated with predecessor bodies of what are now the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America ( ELCA ) from the mergers of 1988 or the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod ( 1847 ) , or the recent North American Lutheran Church ( NALC ) of 2010 ; some were Methodists following Wesleyan doctrine . Today , Swedish Americans are found throughout the United States , with Minnesota , California and Illinois being the top three states with the highest number of Swedish Americans . Historically , newly arrived Swedish immigrants settled in the Midwest , namely Minnesota , the Dakotas and Wisconsin , just as other Scandinavian Americans . Populations also grew in the Pacific Northwest in the states of Oregon and Washington at the turn of the twentieth century .",
  "/wiki/Vernacular_architecture": "Vernacular architecture is architecture characterised by the use of local materials and knowledge , usually without the supervision of professional architects . Vernacular architecture represents the majority of buildings and settlements created in pre-industrial societies and includes a very wide range of buildings , building traditions , and methods of construction . Vernacular buildings are typically simple and practical , whether residential houses or built for other purposes . Although it encompasses 95% of the world 's built environment , vernacular architecture tends to be overlooked in traditional histories of design . It is not one specific style , so it can not be distilled into a series of easy-to-digest patterns , materials , or elements . Because of the usage of traditional building methods and local builders , vernacular buildings are considered part of a regional culture . Vernacular architecture can be contrasted against elite or polite architecture which is characterized by stylistic elements of design intentionally incorporated for aesthetic purposes which go beyond a building 's functional requirements . This article also covers the term traditional architecture , which exists somewhere between the two extremes yet still is based upon authentic themes .",

The town was incorporated in 1901 , though it was founded earlier . The City of Antelope was originally a stage and freight wagon road stop on the Old Dalles to Canyon City Trail . Howard Maupin came to Antelope in 1863 to operate a horse ranch , becoming the caretaker of the stage station which was established by Henry Wheeler in 1864 . Maupin began raising cattle to provide meat for travelers . Nathan Wallace , who is sometimes credited with being Antelope 's first postmaster , acquired the Antelope stage station from Maupin in 1870 . Records indicate the community was considered to have been established in 1872 . In the early 1980s , members of the Rajneesh movement moved in and effectively took over the government of the city by outnumbering the original residents with new voter registrations . On September 18 , 1984 , a vote was held and the city was renamed to Rajneesh . By 1985 , after several of the Rajneesh movement leaders were discovered to have been involved in criminal behavior ( including a mass food poisoning attack and an aborted plot to assassinate a U.S. Attorney ) , their guru left the country as part of a negotiated settlement of federal immigration fraud charges , and the Rajneesh commune collapsed .

It is strongly sprung and generally drawn by four horses . Widely used before steam-powered rail transport was available a stagecoach made long scheduled trips using stage stations or posts where the stagecoach 's horses would be replaced by fresh horses . The business of running stagecoaches or the act of journeying in them was known as staging . Familiar images of the stagecoach are that of a Royal Mail coach passing through a turnpike gate , a Dickensian passenger coach covered in snow pulling up at a coaching inn , and a highwayman demanding a coach to stand and deliver . The yard of ale drinking glass is associated by legend with stagecoach drivers , though it was mainly used for drinking feats and special toasts .",
  "/wiki/Great_Depression": "The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic depression that took place mostly during the 1930s , beginning in the United States . The timing of the Great Depression varied across nations ; in most countries , it started in 1929 and lasted until the late 1930s . It was the longest , deepest , and most widespread depression of the 20th century . The Great Depression is commonly used as an example of how intensely the world 's economy can decline . The Great Depression started in the United States after a major fall in stock prices that began around September 4 , 1929 , and became worldwide news with the stock market crash of October 29 , 1929 , ( known as Black Tuesday ) . Between 1929 and 1932 , worldwide gross domestic product ( GDP ) fell by an estimated 15% . By comparison , worldwide GDP fell by less than 1% from 2008 to 2009 during the Great Recession . Some economies started to recover by the mid-1930s . However , in many countries , the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the beginning of World War II . The Great Depression had devastating effects in countries both rich and poor . Personal income , tax revenue , profits and prices dropped , while international trade plunged by more than 50% . Unemployment in the U.S. rose to 25% and in some countries rose as high as 33% .",

  "/wiki/Barlow_Road": "The Barlow Road ( at inception , Mount Hood Road ) is a historic road in what is now the U.S. state of Oregon . It was built in 1846 by Sam Barlow and Philip Foster , with authorization of the Provisional Legislature of Oregon , and served as the last overland segment of the Oregon Trail . Its construction allowed covered wagons to cross the Cascade Range and reach the Willamette Valley , which had previously been nearly impossible . Even so , it was by far the most harrowing 100 miles ( 160 km ) of the nearly 2,000-mile ( 3,200 km ) Oregon Trail . Before the opening of the Barlow Road , pioneers traveling by land from the east followed the Oregon Trail to Wascopam Mission ( now The Dalles ) and floated down the Columbia River to Fort Vancouver , then a perilous and expensive journey . It was also possible to drive livestock over Lolo Pass on the north side of Mount Hood , but that trail was too rugged for vehicles and unsuitable for wagons . A trading post ( allowed by the Department of War ) had been built where river crossings could be made along with the disassembly of wagons to make rafts suitable for floating down the remainder of the Columbia . [ citation needed ] The Barlow Road begins at Wascopam Mission and heads south to Tygh Valley ( some consider Tygh Valley the origin ) , then turns west and roughly parallels the White River on the north and then west , crosses the south shoulder of Mount Hood at Barlow Pass , follows Camp Creek and the Sandy River for some way , and finally leads to Oregon City . The road was rendered largely irrelevant in the early 1900s by the construction of the Mount Hood Highway . It still exists as a dirt road in some places , while many other parts have been paved over by newer streets and highways .",

  "/wiki/Toll_road": "A toll road , also known as a turnpike or tollway , is a public or private road ( almost always a controlled-access highway in the present day ) for which a fee ( or toll ) is assessed for passage . It is a form of road pricing typically implemented to help recoup the cost of road construction and maintenance . Toll roads have existed in some form since antiquity , with tolls levied on passing travellers on foot , wagon , or horseback ; but their prominence increased with the rise of the automobile , [ citation needed ] and many modern tollways charge fees for motor vehicles exclusively . The amount of the toll usually varies by vehicle type , weight , or number of axles , with freight trucks often charged higher rates than cars . Tolls are often collected at toll plazas , toll booths , toll houses , stations , bars , or gates . Some toll collection points are autonomous , and the user deposits money in a machine which opens the gate once the correct toll has been paid . To cut costs and minimise time delay , many tolls are collected with electronic toll collection equipment which automatically communicates with a toll payer 's transponder or uses automatic number plate recognition to charge drivers by debiting their accounts . Criticisms of toll roads include the time taken to stop and pay the toll , and the cost of the toll booth operators - up to about one-third of revenue in some cases . Automated toll-paying systems help minimise both of these . Others object to paying twice for the same road : in fuel taxes and with tolls . In addition to toll roads , toll bridges and toll tunnels are also used by public authorities to generate funds to repay the cost of building the structures . Some tolls are set aside to pay for future maintenance or enhancement of infrastructure , or are applied as a general fund by local governments , not being earmarked for transport facilities .",

In addition to being Oregon 's highest mountain , it is one of the loftiest mountains in the nation based on its prominence , and it offers the only year-round lift-served skiing in North America . The height assigned to Mount Hood 's snow-covered peak has varied over its history . Modern sources point to three different heights : 11,249 feet ( 3,429 m ) , a 1991 adjustment of a 1986 measurement by the U.S. National Geodetic Survey ( NGS ) , 11,240 feet ( 3,426 m ) based on a 1993 scientific expedition , and 11,239 feet ( 3,425.6 m ) of slightly older origin .

  "/wiki/Oregon_Trail": "The Oregon Trail is a 2,170-mile ( 3,490 km ) historic east-west , large-wheeled wagon route and emigrant trail in the United States that connected the Missouri River to valleys in Oregon . The eastern part of the Oregon Trail spanned part of the future state of Kansas , and nearly all of what are now the states of Nebraska and Wyoming . The western half of the trail spanned most of the future states of Idaho and Oregon . The Oregon Trail was laid by fur traders and trappers from about 1811 to 1840 , and was only passable on foot or by horseback . By 1836 , when the first migrant wagon train was organized in Independence , Missouri , a wagon trail had been cleared to Fort Hall , Idaho . Wagon trails were cleared increasingly farther west , and eventually reached all the way to the Willamette Valley in Oregon , at which point what came to be called the Oregon Trail was complete , even as almost annual improvements were made in the form of bridges , cutoffs , ferries , and roads , which made the trip faster and safer . From various starting points in Iowa , Missouri , or Nebraska Territory , the routes converged along the lower Platte River Valley near Fort Kearny , Nebraska Territory , and led to rich farmlands west of the Rocky Mountains . From the early to mid-1830s ( and particularly through the years 1846-1869 ) the Oregon Trail and its many offshoots were used by about 400,000 settlers , farmers , miners , ranchers , and business owners and their families . The eastern half of the trail was also used by travelers on the California Trail ( from 1843 ) , Mormon Trail ( from 1847 ) , and Bozeman Trail ( from 1863 ) , before turning off to their separate destinations . Use of the trail declined as the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869 , making the trip west substantially faster , cheaper , and safer . Today , modern highways , such as Interstate 80 and Interstate 84 , follow parts of the same course westward and pass through towns originally established to serve those using the Oregon Trail .",

It flows northwest and then south into the US state of Washington , then turns west to form most of the border between Washington and the state of Oregon before emptying into the Pacific Ocean . The river is 1,243 miles ( 2,000 km ) long , and its largest tributary is the Snake River . Its drainage basin is roughly the size of France and extends into seven US states and a Canadian province . The fourth-largest river in the United States by volume , the Columbia has the greatest flow of any North American river entering the Pacific . The Columbia and its tributaries have been central to the region 's culture and economy for thousands of years . They have been used for transportation since ancient times , linking the region 's many cultural groups . The river system hosts many species of anadromous fish , which migrate between freshwater habitats and the saline waters of the Pacific Ocean . These fish - especially the salmon species - provided the core subsistence for native peoples . In the late 18th century , a private American ship became the first non-indigenous vessel to enter the river ; it was followed by a British explorer , who navigated past the Oregon Coast Range into the Willamette Valley . In the following decades , fur trading companies used the Columbia as a key transportation route .",

Every year trade goods and supplies from London arrived either via ships sailing to the Pacific Ocean or overland from Hudson Bay via the York Factory Express . Supplies and trade goods were exchanged with a plethora of Indigenous cultures for fur pelts . Furs from Fort Vancouver were often shipped to the Chinese port of Guangzhou where they were traded for Chinese manufactured goods for sale in the United Kingdom .

The style bears almost no relationship to the Queen Anne style architecture , a toned-down version of English Baroque mostly used for gentry houses , produced in the actual reign of Queen Anne from 1702 to 1714 . It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s .",
  "/wiki/Retailing": "Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to earn a profit . Retailers satisfy demand identified through a supply chain . The term retailer is typically applied where a service provider fills the small orders of many individuals , who are end-users , rather than large orders of a small number of wholesale , corporate or government clientele . Shopping generally refers to the act of buying products . Sometimes this is done to obtain final goods , including necessities such as food and clothing ; sometimes it takes place as a recreational activity . Recreational shopping often involves window shopping and browsing : it does not always result in a purchase . Retail markets and shops have a very ancient history , dating back to antiquity . Some of the earliest retailers were itinerant peddlers . Over the centuries , retail shops were transformed from little more than rude booths to the sophisticated shopping malls of the modern era . Most modern retailers typically make a variety of strategic level decisions including the type of store , the market to be served , the optimal product assortment , customer service , supporting services and the store 's overall market positioning . Once the strategic retail plan is in place , retailers devise the retail mix which includes product , price , place , promotion , personnel , and presentation .

The original highway was promoted by lawyer and entrepreneur Sam Hill and engineer Samuel C. Lancaster , to be modeled after the great scenic roads of Europe . From the very beginning , the roadway was envisioned not just as means of traveling by the then popular Model T , but designed with an elegance that took full advantage of all the natural beauty along the route . When the United States highway system was officially established in 1926 , the highway became the part of U.S. Route 30 .

Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",
  "/wiki/Design": "A design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process , or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype , product or process . The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design . In some cases , the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan ( such as in craftwork , some engineering , coding , and graphic design ) may also be considered to be a design activity . The design usually has to satisfy certain goals and constraints , may take into account aesthetic , functional , economic , or socio-political considerations , and is expected to interact with a certain environment . Major examples of designs include architectural blueprints , engineering drawings , business processes , circuit diagrams , and sewing patterns . The person who produces a design is called a designer , which is a term generally used for people who work professionally in one of the various design areas - usually specifying which area is being dealt with ( such as a textile designer , fashion designer , product designer , concept designer , web designer ( website designer ) or interior designer ) , but also others such as architects and engineers . A designer 's sequence of activities is called a design process , possibly using design methods . The process of creating a design can be brief ( a quick sketch ) or lengthy and complicated , involving considerable research , negotiation , reflection , modeling , interactive adjustment and re-design .",
  "/wiki/Tourism": "Tourism is travel for pleasure or business ; also the theory and practice of touring , the business of attracting , accommodating , and entertaining tourists , and the business of operating tours . The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally , in terms which go beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only , as people traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours , business and other purposes . Tourism can be domestic ( within the traveller 's own country ) or international , and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country 's balance of payments . Tourism numbers declined as a result of a strong economic slowdown ( the late-2000s recession ) between the second half of 2008 and the end of 2009 , and in consequence of the outbreak of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus , but slowly recovered . Globally , international tourism receipts ( the travel item in balance of payments ) grew to US $ 1.03 trillion ( \u20ac740 billion ) in 2005 , corresponding to an increase in real terms of 3.8% from 2010. International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012 , emerging source markets such as China , Russia , and Brazil had significantly increased their spending over the previous decade .

It usually houses the city or town council , its associated departments , and their employees . It also usually functions as the base of the mayor of a city , town , borough , county or shire . By convention , until the middle of the 19th century , a single large open chamber ( or hall ) formed an integral part of the building housing the council . The hall may be used for council meetings and other significant events . This large chamber , the town hall ( and its later variant city hall ) has become synonymous with the whole building , and with the administrative body housed in it . The terms council chambers , municipal building or variants may be used locally in preference to town hall if no such large hall is present within the building . The local government may endeavor to use the building to promote and enhance the quality of life of the community . In many cases , town halls serve not only as buildings for government functions , but also have facilities for various civic and cultural activities . These may include art shows , stage performances , exhibits and festivals . Modern town halls or civic centres are often designed with a great variety and flexibility of purpose in mind .

  "/wiki/Last_glacial_period": "The Last Glacial Period ( LGP ) occurred from the end of the Eemian to the end of the Younger Dryas , encompassing the period c. 115,000 - c. 11,700 years ago . This most recent glacial period is part of a larger pattern of glacial and interglacial periods known as the Quaternary glaciation extending from c. 2,588,000 years ago to present . The definition of the Quaternary as beginning 2.58 Ma is based on the formation of the Arctic ice cap . The Antarctic ice sheet began to form earlier , at about 34 Ma , in the mid-Cenozoic ( Eocene-Oligocene extinction event ) . The term Late Cenozoic Ice Age is used to include this early phase . During this last glacial period there were alternating episodes of glacier advance and retreat . Within the last glacial period the Last Glacial Maximum was approximately 22,000 years ago . While the general pattern of global cooling and glacier advance was similar , local differences in the development of glacier advance and retreat make it difficult to compare the details from continent to continent ( see picture of ice core data below for differences ) . Approximately 12,800 years ago , the Younger Dryas , the most recent glacial period , began . Its end about 11,550 years ago marked the beginning of the Holocene , the current geological epoch . From the point of view of human archaeology , the last glacial period falls in the Paleolithic and early Mesolithic periods .

  "/wiki/Human": "Humans ( Homo sapiens ) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina . Together with chimpanzees , gorillas , and orangutans , they are part of the family Hominidae ( the great apes , or hominids ) . Terrestrial animals , humans are characterized by their erect posture and bipedal locomotion ; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals ; open-ended and complex language use compared to other animal communications ; larger , more complex brains than other animals ; and highly advanced and organized societies . Early hominins - particularly the australopithecines , whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes - are less often referred to as human than hominins of the genus Homo . Several of these hominins used fire , occupied much of Eurasia , and the lineage that gave rise to Homo sapiens is thought to have diverged in Africa around 500,000 years ago , with the earliest fossil evidence of evidence of early Homo sapiens appearing ( also in Africa ) around 300,000 years ago . The oldest early H. sapiens fossils were found in Jebel Irhoud , Morocco dating to about 315,000 years ago . Discovered in 1967 , Omo-Kibish I ( Omo I ) from southern Ethiopia is , as of 2017 [ update ] , the oldest anatomically modern Homo sapiens skeleton currently known ( 196 \u00b1 5 ka ) . Humans began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity at least by about 100,000-70,000 years ago and ( according to recent evidence ) as far back as around 300,000 years ago , in the Middle Stone Age , with some features of behavioral modernity possibly beginning earlier , and possibly in parallel with evolutionary brain globularization in H. sapiens . In several waves of migration , H. sapiens ventured out of Africa and populated most of the world . The spread of the large and increasing population of humans has profoundly affected much of the biosphere and millions of species worldwide . Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a larger brain with a well-developed neocortex , prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes , which enable advanced abstract reasoning , language , problem solving , sociality , and culture through social learning . Humans use tools more frequently and effectively than any other animal : they are the only extant species to build fires , cook food , clothe themselves , and create and use numerous other technologies and arts .",

BCE and CE are alternatives to the Dionysian BC and AD system respectively . The Dionysian era distinguishes eras using AD ( anno Domini , in [ the ] year of [ the ] Lord ) and BC ( before Christ ) . Since the two notation systems are numerically equivalent , 2020 CE corresponds to AD 2020 and 400 BCE corresponds to 400 BC .

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

These conflicts occurred in North America from the time of the earliest colonial settlements in the 17th century until the early 20th century . The various wars resulted from a wide variety of factors , including cultural clashes , land disputes , and criminal acts committed by both sides . The European powers and their colonies also enlisted Indian tribes to help them conduct warfare against each other 's colonial settlements . After the American Revolution , many conflicts were local to specific states or regions and frequently involved disputes over land use ; some entailed cycles of violent reprisal . In Canada , 11 Numbered Treaties covering most of the First Nations lands limited the number of such conflicts . As settlers spread westward across America and Canada after 1780 , armed conflicts increased in size , duration , and intensity between settlers and various Indian and First Nation tribes . The climax came in the War of 1812 , when major Indian coalitions in the Midwest and the South fought against the United States and lost . Conflict with settlers became much less common and was usually resolved by treaty , often through sale or exchange of territory between the federal government and specific tribes . The Indian Removal Act of 1830 authorized the American government to enforce the Indian removal from east of the Mississippi River to the west on the American frontier , especially Oklahoma . The federal policy of removal was eventually refined in the West , as American settlers kept expanding their territories , to relocate Indian tribes to specially designated and federally protected and subsidized reservations .",

  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",
  "/wiki/Merchant": "A merchant is a person who trades in commodities produced by other people . Historically , a merchant is anyone who is involved in business or trade . Merchants have operated for as long as industry , commerce , and trade have existed . In 16th-century Europe , two different terms for merchants emerged : meerseniers referred to local traders ( such as bakers and grocers ) and koopman ( Dutch : koopman ) referred to merchants who operated on a global stage , importing and exporting goods over vast distances and offering added-value services such as credit and finance . The status of the merchant has varied during different periods of history and among different societies . In ancient Rome and Greece merchants could become wealthy , but lacked high social status . In contrast , in the Middle East , where markets were an integral part of the city , merchants enjoyed high status . In modern times , the term merchant has occasionally been used to refer to a businessperson or someone undertaking activities ( commercial or industrial ) for the purpose of generating profit , cash flow , sales , and revenue utilizing a combination of human , financial , intellectual and physical capital with a view to fueling economic development and growth .",

  "/wiki/Ranch": "A ranch is an area of land , including various structures , given primarily to the practice of ranching , the practice of raising grazing livestock such as cattle and sheep most often applies to livestock-raising operations in Mexico , the Western United States and Western Canada , though there are ranches in other areas . People who own or operate a ranch are called ranchers , cattlemen , or stockgrowers . Ranching is also a method used to raise less common livestock such as horses , elk , American bison or even ostrich , emu , and alpaca . Ranches generally consist of large areas , but may be of nearly any size . In the western United States , many ranches are a combination of privately owned land supplemented by grazing leases on land under the control of the federal Bureau of Land Management or the United States Forest Service . If the ranch includes arable or irrigated land , the ranch may also engage in a limited amount of farming , raising crops for feeding the animals , such as hay and feed grains . Ranches that cater exclusively to tourists are called guest ranches or , colloquially , dude ranches . Most working ranches do not cater to guests , though they may allow private hunters or outfitters onto their property to hunt native wildlife . However , in recent years , a few struggling smaller operations have added some dude ranch features , such as horseback rides , cattle drives or guided hunting , in an attempt to bring in additional income . Ranching is part of the iconography of the Wild West as seen in Western movies and rodeos .",
  "/wiki/Militia": "A militia ( /m\u026a\u02c8l\u026a\u0283\u0259/ ) is generally an army or some other fighting organization of non-professional soldiers , citizens of a nation , or subjects of a state , who can be called upon for military service during a time of need , as opposed to a professional force of regular , full-time military personnel , or historically , members of a warrior nobility class ( e.g. , knights or samurai ) . Generally unable to hold ground against regular forces , it is common for militias to be used for aiding regular troops by skirmishing , holding fortifications , or irregular warfare , instead of being used in offensive campaigns by themselves . Militia are often limited by local civilian laws to serve only in their home region , and to serve only for a limited time ; this further reduces their use in long military campaigns . With the emergence of professional forces ( in the form of mercenaries whose livelihood was military service ) during the Renaissance , Western European militias wilted ; later however , they would be revived as part of Florentine civic humanism , which held that professional militaries were a result of corruption , and admired the Roman model . The civic humanist ideal of the militia was spread through Europe by the writings of Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli ( According to H\u00f6rnqvist , The Prince , ch . 12 and 13 , Discourses on Livy , and The Art of War . ) Beginning in the late 20th century , some militias ( in particular officially recognized and sanctioned militias of a government ) act as professional forces , while still being part-time or on-call organizations . For instance , the members of U.S. Army National Guard units are considered professional soldiers , as they are trained to maintain the same standards as their full-time ( active duty ) counterparts . [ citation needed ] Militias thus can be military or paramilitary , depending on the instance . Some of the contexts in which the term militia is used include :",

  "/wiki/The_Reverend": "The Reverend is an honorific style most often placed before the names of Christian clergy and ministers . There are sometimes differences in the way the style is used in different countries and church traditions . The Reverend is correctly called a style but is often and in some dictionaries called a title , form of address or title of respect . The style is also sometimes used by leaders in non-Christian religions , such as Judaism . The term is an anglicisation of the Latin reverendus , the style originally used in Latin documents in medieval Europe . It is the gerundive or future passive participle of the verb revereri ( to respect ; to revere ) , meaning [ one who is ] to be revered/must be respected . The Reverend is therefore equivalent to The Honourable or The Venerable . It is paired with a modifier or noun for some offices in some religious traditions : Anglican archbishops and most Roman Catholic bishops are usually styled The Most Reverend ( reverendissimus ) ; other Anglican bishops and some Roman Catholic bishops are styled The Right Reverend . With Christian clergy , the forms His Reverence and Her Reverence is also sometimes used , along with its parallel in direct address , Your Reverence . The abbreviation HR is sometimes used .",

  "/wiki/Queen_Anne_style_architecture_in_the_United_States": "In the United States , Queen Anne-style architecture was popular from roughly 1880 to 1910 . Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles . The style bears almost no relationship to the Queen Anne style architecture , a toned-down version of English Baroque mostly used for gentry houses , produced in the actual reign of Queen Anne from 1702 to 1714 . It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s .",

They can range from simple dwellings such as rudimentary huts of nomadic tribes and the improvised shacks in shantytowns to complex , fixed structures of wood , masonry , concrete or other materials containing plumbing , ventilation , and electrical systems . Houses use a range of different roofing systems to keep precipitation such as rain from getting into the dwelling space . Houses may have doors or locks to secure the dwelling space and protect its inhabitants and contents from burglars or other trespassers . Most conventional modern houses in Western cultures will contain one or more bedrooms and bathrooms , a kitchen or cooking area , and a living room . A house may have a separate dining room , or the eating area may be integrated into another room . Some large houses in North America have a recreation room . In traditional agriculture-oriented societies , domestic animals such as chickens or larger livestock ( like cattle ) may share part of the house with humans . The social unit that lives in a house is known as a household . Most commonly , a household is a family unit of some kind , although households may also be other social groups , such as roommates or , in a rooming house , unconnected individuals .

Based on revival of aspects that were perceived as Tudor architecture , in reality it usually took the style of English vernacular architecture of the Middle Ages that had survived into the Tudor period . The style later became an influence elsewhere , especially the British colonies . For example , in New Zealand , the architect Francis Petre adapted the style for the local climate . In Singapore , then a British colony , architects such as R. A. J. Bidwell pioneered what became known as the Black and White House . The earliest examples of the style originate with the works of such eminent architects as Norman Shaw and George Devey , in what at the time was thought Neo-Tudor design .

Many species of salmon have been introduced into non-native environments such as the Great Lakes of North America and Patagonia in South America . Salmon are intensively farmed in many parts of the world . Typically , salmon are anadromous : they hatch in fresh water , migrate to the ocean , then return to fresh water to reproduce . However , populations of several species are restricted to fresh water through their lives . Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact spot where they hatched to spawn . Tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true . A portion of a returning salmon run may stray and spawn in different freshwater systems ; the percent of straying depends on the species of salmon .

  "/wiki/Wheat": "Wheat is a grass widely cultivated for its seed , a cereal grain which is a worldwide staple food . The many species of wheat together make up the genus Triticum ; the most widely grown is common wheat ( T. aestivum ) . The archaeological record suggests that wheat was first cultivated in the regions of the Fertile Crescent around 9600 BCE . Botanically , the wheat kernel is a type of fruit called a caryopsis . Wheat is grown on more land area than any other food crop ( 220.4 million hectares , 2014 ) . World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined . In 2017 , world production of wheat was 772 million tonnes , with a forecast of 2019 production at 766 million tonnes , making it the second most-produced cereal after maize . Since 1960 , world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st century . Global demand for wheat is increasing due to the unique viscoelastic and adhesive properties of gluten proteins , which facilitate the production of processed foods , whose consumption is increasing as a result of the worldwide industrialization process and the westernization of the diet . Wheat is an important source of carbohydrates . Globally , it is the leading source of vegetable protein in human food , having a protein content of about 13% , which is relatively high compared to other major cereals but relatively low in protein quality for supplying essential amino acids . When eaten as the whole grain , wheat is a source of multiple nutrients and dietary fiber .",
  "/wiki/Cash_crop": "A cash crop or profit crop is an agricultural crop which is grown to sell for profit . It is typically purchased by parties separate from a farm . The term is used to differentiate marketed crops from subsistence crops , which are those fed to the producer 's own livestock or grown as food for the producer 's family . In earlier times cash crops were usually only a small ( but vital ) part of a farm 's total yield , while today , especially in developed countries , almost all crops are mainly grown for revenue . In the least developed countries , cash crops are usually crops which attract demand in more developed nations , and hence have some export value . Prices for major cash crops are set in commodity markets with global scope , with some local variation ( termed as basis ) based on freight costs and local supply and demand balance .

  "/wiki/Maupin_Section_Foreman's_House": "The Maupin Section Foreman 's House is a historic section house in Maupin , Oregon , United States . It recalls the days of the Last Great Railroad War ( construction 1909-1911 ) between the rival transportation empires of E. H. Harriman and James J. Hill , as they raced to build routes up the Deschutes River canyon , connecting the mainlines along the Columbia River to the new markets of Central Oregon . Harriman 's Des Chutes Railroad Company built the house to the Union Pacific Common Standard Plan for buildings ( with allowed variations ) in 1910 . It was one of three buildings in the country combination station at Maupin , and served as residence for the maintenance of way foreman for the local section of track . The other two buildings of the station ( a depot and a bunk residence for the maintenance crew ) were demolished by 1968 . Most of the Des Chutes Railroad tracks in the canyon were abandoned in 1936 , granting Hill the final victory in the race . The road passing in front of the house utilizes the former railroad grade .
