Under NCAA rules , Division I and Division II schools can offer scholarships to athletes for playing a sport . Division III schools may not offer any athletic scholarships . Generally , larger schools compete in Division I and smaller schools in II and III . Division I football was further divided into I-A and I-AA in 1978 . Subsequently , the term Division I-AAA was briefly added to delineate Division I schools which do not field a football program at all , but that term is no longer officially used by the NCAA . In 2006 , Divisions I-A and I-AA were respectively renamed the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) and Football Championship Subdivision ( FCS ) .

  "/wiki/College_football": "College football is gridiron football consisting of American football played by teams of student athletes fielded by American universities , colleges , and military academies , or Canadian football played by teams of student athletes fielded by Canadian universities . It was through college football play that American football rules first gained popularity in the United States . Unlike most other sports in North America , no minor league farm organizations exist in American or Canadian football . Therefore , college football is generally considered to be the second tier of American football in the United States and Canadian football in Canada ; one step ahead of high school competition , and one step below professional competition . However , in some areas of the country , college football is more popular than professional football , and for much of the early 20th century , college football was seen as more prestigious than professional football . It is in college football where a player 's performance directly impacts his chances of playing professional football . The best collegiate players will typically declare for the professional draft after three to four years of collegiate competition , with the NFL holding its annual draft every spring in which 256 players are selected annually . Those not selected can still attempt to land an NFL roster spot as an undrafted free agent .",

  "/wiki/Baseball": "Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding . The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team , called the pitcher , throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat . The objective of the offensive team ( batting team ) is to hit the ball into the field of play , allowing its players to run the bases , having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called runs . The objective of the defensive team ( fielding team ) is to prevent batters from becoming runners , and to prevent runners ' advance around the bases . A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate ( the place where the player started as a batter ) . The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner . The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely . A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called out can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner , either immediately or during teammates ' turns batting . The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners out , which forces them out of the field of play . Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team 's players out . The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding ; the batting team 's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs . One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning .",
  "/wiki/First_baseman": "First base , or 1B , is the first of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a baserunner to score a run for that player 's team . A first baseman is the player on the team playing defense who fields the area nearest first base , and is responsible for the majority of plays made at that base . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the first baseman is assigned the number 3 . Also called first sacker or cornerman , the first baseman is ideally a tall player who throws left-handed and possesses good flexibility and quick reflexes . Flexibility is needed because the first baseman receives throws from the other infielders , the catcher and the pitcher after they have fielded ground balls . In order for the runner to be called out , the first baseman must be able to stretch towards the throw and catch it before the runner reaches first base . First base is often referred to as the other hot corner - the hot corner being third base - and therefore , like the third baseman , he must have quick reflexes to field the hardest hit balls down the foul line , mainly by left-handed pull hitters and right-handed hitters hitting to the opposite field . They often are power hitters who have a substantial number of home runs and extra base hits while maintaining a .270 plus batting average . [ citation needed ]",
