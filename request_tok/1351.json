Rather than using the brackets that are now standard for double-elimination contests ( and which assure that each match is between two competitors with the same number of losses ) , each wrestler drew a number . Each man would face off against the wrestler with the next number , provided he had not already faced that wrestler and that the wrestler was not from the same nation as him ( unless this was necessary to avoid byes ) . When only three wrestlers remain ( the medalists ) , the double-elimination halts and a special final round is used to determine the order of the medals . The event was unusual in that no gold medal was awarded . The final match between Ahlgren and B\u00f6hling was declared a draw after more than 9 hours of wrestling . Since the rules of the contest were worded in such a way that the gold medalist had to have defeated his opponent , neither man could take the gold medal and both received silver ."
