  "/wiki/F1": "Formula One ( also known as Formula 1 or F1 ) is the highest class of single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile ( FIA ) and owned by the Formula One Group . The World Drivers ' Championship , which became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981 , has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950 . The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants ' cars must conform . A Formula One season consists of a series of races , known as Grands Prix ( French for 'grand prizes ' or 'great prizes ' ) , which take place worldwide on purpose-built circuits and on public roads . The results of each race are evaluated using a points system to determine two annual World Championships : one for drivers , the other for constructors . Drivers must hold valid Super Licences , the highest class of racing licence issued by the FIA . The races must run on tracks graded 1 ( formerly A ) , the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA . Most events occur in rural locations on purpose-built tracks , but several events take place on city streets . Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world , owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce . The cars underwent major changes in 2017 , allowing wider front and rear wings , and wider tyres , resulting in peak cornering forces near 6.5 lateral g and top speeds of up to approximately 350 km/h ( 215 mph ) . As of 2019 [ update ] the hybrid engines are limited in performance to a maximum of 15,000 rpm , the cars are very dependent on electronics and aerodynamics , suspension and tyres . Traction control and other driving aids have been banned since 2008 .",
  "/wiki/Alain_Prost": "Alain Marie Pascal Prost OBE ( born 24 February 1955 ) is a retired French racing driver and a four-time Formula One Drivers ' Champion . From 1987 until 2001 he held the record for most Grand Prix victories , and is considered as one of the greatest F1 drivers ever . Michael Schumacher surpassed Prost 's total of 51 victories at the 2001 Belgian Grand Prix . In 1999 , Prost received the World Sports Award of the Century in the motor sport category . Prost discovered karting at the age of 14 during a family holiday . He progressed through motor sport 's junior ranks , winning the French and European Formula Three championships , before joining the McLaren Formula One team in 1980 at the age of 24 . He finished in the points on his Formula One d\u00e9but - at the San Martin Autodrome in Buenos Aires , Argentina , where he took his first podium a year later - and took his first race victory a year later at his home Grand Prix in France , driving for the factory Renault team . During the 1980s and early 1990s Prost formed a fierce sporting rivalry , mainly with Ayrton Senna but also Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell . In 1986 , at Adelaide in the last race of the season , he beat Mansell and Piquet of Williams to the title , after Mansell retired late in the race and Piquet was pulled in for a late precautionary pit stop . Senna joined Prost at McLaren in 1988 and the two had a series of controversial clashes , including a collision at the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix that gave Prost his third Drivers ' Championship . A year later at the same venue they collided again , but this time Prost , driving for Ferrari , lost out . Before the end of a winless 1991 season Prost was fired by Ferrari for his public criticism of the team .",

There was no commonality between the cars from country to country . The FIA-endorsed category was formally created in March 2013 , when it was approved by the World Motor Sport Council .
